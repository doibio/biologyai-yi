BACKGROUND: Emerging fungal pathogens pose important threats to global public 
health. The World Health Organization has responded to the rising threat of 
traditionally neglected fungal infections by developing a Fungal Priority 
Pathogens List (FPPL). Taking the highest-ranked fungal pathogen in the FPPL, 
Cryptococcus neoformans, as a paradigm, we review progress made over the past 
two decades on its global burden, its clinical manifestation and management of 
cryptococcal infection, and its antifungal resistance. The purpose of this 
review is to drive research efforts to improve future diagnoses, therapies, and 
interventions associated with fungal infections.
METHODS: We first reviewed trends in the global burden of HIV-associated 
cryptococcal infection, mainly based on a series of systematic studies. We next 
conducted scoping reviews in accordance with the guidelines described in the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews using PubMed and ScienceDirect with the keyword Cryptococcus 
neoformans to identify case reports of cryptococcal infections published since 
2000. We then reviewed recent updates on the diagnosis and antifungal treatment 
of cryptococcal infections. Finally, we summarized knowledge regarding the 
resistance and tolerance of C. neoformans to approved antifungal drugs.
RESULTS: There has been a general reduction in the estimated global burden of 
HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis since 2009, probably due to improvements 
in highly active antiretroviral therapies. However, cryptococcal meningitis 
still accounts for 19% of AIDS-related deaths annually. The incidences of CM in 
Europe and North America and the Latin America region have increased by 
approximately two-fold since 2009, while other regions showed either reduced or 
stable numbers of cases. Unfortunately, diagnostic and treatment options for 
cryptococcal infections are limited, and emerging antifungal resistance 
exacerbates the public health burden.
CONCLUSION: The rising threat of C. neoformans is compounded by accumulating 
evidence for its ability to infect immunocompetent individuals and the emergence 
of antifungal-resistant variants. Emphasis should be placed on further 
understanding the mechanisms of pathogenicity and of antifungal resistance and 
tolerance. The development of novel management strategies through the 
identification of new drug targets and the discovery and optimization of new and 
existing diagnostics and therapeutics are key to reducing the health burden.

BACKGROUND: Digital public health (DiPH) provides novel approaches for 
prevention, potentially leading to long-term health benefits in resource-limited 
health systems. However, cost-effectiveness of DiPH interventions is unclear. 
This systematized review investigates the use of decision-analytic modelling in 
health economic evaluations of DiPH primary prevention and health promotion 
interventions, focusing on intervention's design, methods used, results, and 
reporting quality.
METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for studies of 
decision-analytic economic evaluations of digital interventions in primary 
prevention or health promotion, published up to June 2022. Intervention 
characteristics and selected items were extracted based on the Consolidated 
Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were then extracted and price-adjusted to 
compare the economic evaluation results. Finally, the included studies' 
reporting quality was assessed by building a score using CHEERS.
RESULTS: The database search (including search update) produced 2,273 hits. 
After removing duplicates, 1,434 titles and abstracts were screened. Of the 89 
studies meeting the full-text search criteria, 14 were ultimately reviewed. The 
most common targets were physical activity (five studies) and weight loss 
(four). Digital applications include text messages, web-based inventions, 
app-based interventions, e-learning devices, and the promotion of smartphone 
apps. The mean ICER of the 12 studies using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
is €20,955 per QALY (min. - €3,949; max. €114,211). The mean of reported CHEERS 
items per study is 81% (min. 59%; max. 91%).
CONCLUSIONS: This review only includes primary prevention and health promotion, 
and thus excludes other DiPH fields (e.g. secondary prevention). It also focuses 
on decision-analytic models, excluding study-based economic evaluations. 
Standard methods of economic evaluation could be adapted more to the specifics 
of DiPH by measuring the effectiveness of more current technologies through 
alternative methods, incorporating a societal perspective, and more clearly 
defining comparators. Nevertheless, the review demonstrates using common 
thresholds that the new field of DiPH shows potential for cost-effective 
preventive interventions.

There is considerable interest in exploring effects of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic on mental health. Suicide is one of the leading causes of 
mortality worldwide and changes in daily life brought by the pandemic may be 
additional risk factors in people with pre-existing mental disorders. This rapid 
PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
extension for Scoping Reviews) scoping review aims to identify and analyze 
current evidence about the relation between COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, along 
with COVID-19 disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV2) infection, and suicide in individuals with previously diagnosed 
mental disorders. First, we conducted a comprehensive review of the literature, 
then proceeded to discuss findings in a narrative way. Tables were constructed 
and articles sorted according to the studies' methodologies. 53 papers were 
eventually identified as eligible, among which 33 are cross-sectional studies, 9 
are longitudinal studies, and 11 studies using other methodologies. Despite 
suffering from a mental disorder is a risk factor for suicidal behavior per se, 
the advent of COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate this relation. Nevertheless, data 
addressing a clear correlation between suicidal behavior and the pandemic 
outbreak are still controversial. Longitudinal analysis using validated suicide 
scales and multicenter studies could provide deeper insight and knowledge about 
this topic.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with neurocognitive impairment (NI) have multiple medical 
needs, with respiratory problems leading to an important reduction in quality of 
life and life expectancy. We aimed to explain that the origin of chronic 
respiratory symptoms in patients with NI is multifactorial.
AREAS COVERED: In people with NI there is a high prevalence of swallowing 
dysfunction and hypersalivation inducing aspiration; cough efficacy is decreased 
resulting in chronic lung infection; sleep-disordered breathing is frequent and 
muscle mass is abnormal due to malnutrition. Technical investigations are not 
always specific and sensitive enough to better diagnose the causes of the 
respiratory symptoms; moreover, they can sometimes be difficult to perform in 
this vulnerable patient population. We provide a clinical pathway to adopt to 
identify, prevent, and treat respiratory complications in children and young 
adults with NI. A holistic approach in discussion with all care providers and 
the parents is highly recommended.
EXPERT OPINION: The care for people with NI and chronic respiratory problems is 
challenging. The interplay between several causative factors may be difficult to 
entangle. Well-performed clinical research in this field is largely missing and 
should be encouraged. Only then, evidence-based clinical care will become 
possible for this vulnerable patient group.

OBJECTIVE: Increasing life expectancy has led to an older population. In this 
study, the authors analyzed complications and outcomes in elderly patients 
following spinal cord injury (SCI) using the established multi-institutional 
prospective study Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in SCI 
(TRACK-SCI) database collected in the Department of Neurosurgical Surgery at the 
University of California, San Francisco.
METHODS: TRACK-SCI was queried for elderly individuals (≥ 65 years of age) with 
traumatic SCI from 2015 to 2019. Primary outcomes of interest included total 
hospital length of stay, perioperative complications, postoperative 
complications, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 
disposition location, and neurological improvement based on the American Spinal 
Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade at discharge. Descriptive 
analysis, Fisher's exact test, univariate analysis, and multivariable regression 
analysis were performed.
RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 40 elderly patients. The in-hospital 
mortality rate was 10%. Every patient in this cohort experienced at least 1 
complication, with a mean of 6.6 separate complications (median 6, mode 4). The 
most common complication categories were cardiovascular, with a mean of 1.6 
complications (median 1, mode 1), and pulmonary, with a mean of 1.3 (median 1, 
mode 0) complications, with 35 patients (87.5%) having at least 1 cardiovascular 
complication and 25 (62.5%) having at least 1 pulmonary complication. Overall, 
32 patients (80%) required vasopressor treatment for mean arterial pressure 
(MAP) maintenance goals. The use of norepinephrine correlated with increased 
cardiovascular complications. Only 3 patients (7.5%) of the total cohort had an 
improved AIS grade compared with their acute level at admission.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the increased frequency of cardiovascular complications 
associated with vasopressor use in elderly SCI patients, caution is warranted 
when targeting MAP goals in these patients. A downward adjustment of blood 
pressure maintenance goals and prophylactic cardiology consultation to select 
the most appropriate vasopressor agent may be advisable for SCI patients ≥ 65 
years of age.

Increasing life expectancy is prompting the need to understand how the brain 
changes during healthy aging. Research utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) 
has found that the power of alpha oscillations decrease from adulthood on. 
However, non-oscillatory (aperiodic) components in the data may confound results 
and thus require re-investigation of these findings. Thus, the present report 
analyzed a pilot and two additional independent samples (total N = 533) of 
resting-state EEG from healthy young and elderly individuals. A newly developed 
algorithm was utilized that allows the decomposition of the measured signal into 
periodic and aperiodic signal components. By using multivariate sequential 
Bayesian updating of the age effect in each signal component, evidence across 
the datasets was accumulated. It was hypothesized that previously reported 
age-related alpha power differences will largely diminish when total power is 
adjusted for the aperiodic signal component. First, the age-related decrease in 
total alpha power was replicated. Concurrently, decreases of the intercept and 
slope (i.e. exponent) of the aperiodic signal component were observed. Findings 
on aperiodic-adjusted alpha power indicated that this general shift of the power 
spectrum leads to an overestimation of the true age effects in conventional 
analyses of total alpha power. Thus, the importance of separating neural power 
spectra into periodic and aperiodic signal components is highlighted. However, 
also after accounting for these confounding factors, the sequential Bayesian 
updating analysis provided robust evidence that aging is associated with 
decreased aperiodic-adjusted alpha power. While the relation of the aperiodic 
component and aperiodic-adjusted alpha power to cognitive decline demands 
further investigation, the consistent findings on age effects across independent 
datasets and high test-retest reliabilities support that these newly emerging 
measures are reliable markers of the aging brain. Hence, previous 
interpretations of age-related decreases in alpha power are reevaluated, 
incorporating changes in the aperiodic signal.

CONTEXT: With the expansion of palliative care services in clinical settings, 
clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have become increasingly crucial for 
assisting bedside nurses and other clinicians in improving the quality of care 
to patients with life-limiting health conditions.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize palliative care CDSSs and explore end-users' actions 
taken, adherence recommendations, and clinical decision time.
METHODS: The CINAHL, Embase, and PubMed databases were searched from inception 
to September 2022. The review was developed following the preferred reporting 
items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews 
guidelines. Qualified studies were described in tables and assessed the level of 
evidence.
RESULTS: A total of 284 abstracts were screened, and 12 studies comprised the 
final sample. The CDSSs selected focused on identifying patients who could 
benefit from palliative care based on their health status, making referrals to 
palliative care services, and managing medications and symptom control. Despite 
the variability of palliative CDSSs, all studies reported that CDSSs assisted 
clinicians in becoming more informed about palliative care options leading to 
better decisions and improved patient outcomes. Seven studies explored the 
impact of CDSSs on end-user adherence. Three studies revealed high adherence to 
recommendations while four had low adherence. Lack of feature customization and 
trust in guideline-based in the initial stages of feasibility and usability 
testing were evident, limiting the usefulness for nurses and other clinicians.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that implementing palliative care CDSSs can 
assist nurses and other clinicians in improving the quality of care for 
palliative patients. The studies' different methodological approaches and 
variations in palliative CDSSs made it challenging to compare and validate the 
applicability under which CDSSs are effective. Further research utilizing 
rigorous methods to evaluate the impact of clinical decision support features 
and guideline-based actions on clinicians' adherence and efficiency is 
recommended.

The high cure rates of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) make this oncological disease among 
those with the greatest number of long-term survivors. This single-institution 
study including 383 HL patients with up to 45 years of follow-up, analyses the 
morbidity and mortality of this population after treatments in comparison with 
the overall Spanish population, and investigates whether it has changed over 
time stratifying by periods of time, as a consequence of therapeutic 
optimization. The median age was 34.8 years (range 15-87) with median overall 
survival of 30 years, significantly higher in women (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.79) 
(p = 0.0002). 185 late-stage diseases were noted (35% patients), cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) being the most frequent (23.2%). 30% of patients developed at 
least one second malignant neoplasm (SMN) to give a total of 174 SMNs. 20.9% of 
the patients died from HL and 67.0% died from non-HL causes (32.2% from SMN, 17% 
from CVD). The overall standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 3.57 (95% CI: 
3.0-4.2), with striking values of 7.73 (95% CI: 5.02-8.69) and of 14.75 (95% CI: 
11.38-19.12) for women and patients <30 years at diagnosis, respectively. 
Excluding HL as the cause of death, the SMRs of those diagnosed before 2000 and 
from 2000 were proved to be similar (3.88 vs 2.73), maintaining in this last 
period an unacceptable excess of mortality due to secondary toxicity in patients 
cured of HL. Our study confirm that HL treatment substantially reduces the life 
expectancy of patients cured of HL. In recent periods, despite therapeutic 
optimization, deaths from toxicity continue to occur, mainly from CVD and SMN. 
Risk-factor monitoring should be intensified, prevention programs developed, and 
therapeutic optimization of LH investigated, especially in two vulnerable 
groups: those aged <30 years at diagnosis, and women.

Alcalá de Henares, (Madrid) 28801, Spain.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have used different biometric indicators to measure 
the effect of Covid-19 on population mortality such as the number of deaths or 
the decrease of life expectancy showing a dependence of mortality on age and 
sex. According to them, the impact of the pandemic was greater on women than in 
men and that the older the population, the greater the number of deaths caused 
by Covid-19.
METHODS: We apply graduation techniques and non-parametric methods to estimate 
mortality rates allowing us to obtain an age-by-age picture of changes in 
mortality rates from 2018-2019 to 2020.
RESULTS: Graduation techniques have detected a significant U-shaped reduction in 
infant mortality rates although with an anomalous peak in girls aged 10-12. 
Likewise, we have observed a notable increase in mortality rates of the female 
population between 28 and 40 years of age. The increase of mortality rates after 
the age of 70 years was similar for both men and women with a slight decline 
after the age of 80.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of graduation techniques and the focus on age-by-age 
changes in mortality rates showed a complex behaviour in some tranches of the 
mortality curve that might otherwise have gone unnoticed.

PURPOSE: Improved life expectancy has increased the likelihood for long-term 
complications from chemotherapy among cancer survivors. One burdensome 
complication is chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). We evaluated 
rates of CIPN outcomes in the Detroit Research on Cancer Survivorship (ROCS) 
cohort.
METHODS: The population included 1,034 African American (AA) survivors who 
received chemotherapy for breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer. CIPN 
prevalence was based on initial occurrence of worsening of self-reported pain, 
numbness or tingling after chemotherapy. Current CIPN included symptoms still 
present at the time of the survey, and persistent CIPN symptoms were present 12 
or more months post-chemotherapy. CIPN severity was ranked as mild, moderate or 
severe. Logistic regression was utilized to evaluate sociodemographic and 
clinical factors associated with the various categories of CIPN.
RESULTS: CIPN prevalence was 68%, with 53% current and 52% persistent. The 
symptom severity distribution based on prevalent CIPN included 32.2% mild, 30.8% 
moderate, and 36.9% severe. Factors associated with prevalent CIPN (odds ratio, 
95% confidence interval) included primary cancer site (breast: 3.88, 2.02-7.46); 
and (colorectal: 5.37, 2.69-10.73), lower risk for older age at diagnosis (0.66, 
0.53-0.83) and divorced/separated marital status (2.13, 1.42-3.21). Current CIPN 
was in addition, associated with more advanced stage disease trend (1.34, 
1.08-1.66) and greater number of co-morbid medical conditions trend (1.23, 
1.09-1.40), as was persistent CIPN. Severity of prevalent CIPN was associated 
with history of arthritis (1.55, 1.06-2.26) and severity of persistent CIPN with 
higher BMI (1.58, 1.07-2.35).
CONCLUSIONS: CIPN is a common and persistent complication in AA cancer 
survivors. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of CIPN 
predictors in all groups of cancer survivors.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to examine the associations between 
built environments and life expectancy across a gradient of urbanicity in the 
U.S.
METHODS: Census tract‒level estimates of life expectancy between 2010 and 2015, 
except for Maine and Wisconsin, from the U.S. Small-Area Life Expectancy 
Estimates Project were analyzed in 2022. Tract-level measures of the built 
environment included: food, alcohol, and tobacco outlets; walkability; park and 
green space; housing characteristics; and air pollution. Multilevel linear 
models for each of the 4 urbanicity types were fitted to evaluate the 
associations, adjusting for population and social characteristics.
RESULTS: Old housing (built before 1979) and air pollution were important built 
environment predictors of life expectancy disparities across all gradients of 
urbanicity. Convenience stores were negatively associated with life expectancy 
in all urbanicity types. Healthy food options were a positive predictor of life 
expectancy only in high-density urban areas. Park accessibility was associated 
with increased life expectancy in all areas, except rural areas. Green space in 
neighborhoods was positively associated with life expectancy in urban areas but 
showed an opposite association in rural areas.
CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for key social characteristics, several built 
environment characteristics were salient risk factors for decreased life 
expectancy in the U.S., with some measures showing differential effects by 
urbanicity. Planning and policy efforts should be tailored to local contexts.

OBJECTIVES: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the 3 major eye 
diseases recognized by WHO to prevent blindness, and which is the main cause of 
irreversible visual impairment in the elderly. This study aims to analyze the 
disease epidemiological burden, and provide a theoretical foundation for the 
prevention and control of AMD in China based on the data in global burden of 
disease (GBD) 2019.
METHODS: The prevalent cases/prevalence, disability-adjusted life year 
(DALYs)/DALY rate of AMD and socio-demographic index (SDI) for global and China 
were searched from the GBD 2019 database to analyze the epidemiological trend, 
age-period-gender trend of AMD in China from 1990 to 2019, and to evaluate the 
relations between the prevalence and SDI.
RESULTS: In 2019, the prevalence of AMD in China was at a high level in the 
world, and the number of prevalent cases were 1.93 times of that in 1990. The 
prevalence and DALY rates continued to rise. The age trend of AMD in China was 
high at the middle of the age stages and low at the two ends, and which was 
higher in the female than in the male. With the increase of SDI, the prevalence 
of AMD was increased linearly.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of AMD in China is increased significantly and 
is positively correlated with the social development from 1990 to 2019. It is of 
great significance to study the relationship between epidemilolgical data of AMD 
and social development level for diagnosis treatment and policy of AMD.

Publisher: 目的: 年龄相关性黄斑变性(age-related macular 
degeneration，AMD)是WHO认定的三大重点防盲眼病之一，是老年人视力不可逆性损伤的主要原因。本研究旨在通过分析全球疾病负担(global 
burden of disease，GBD)2019数据库的中国AMD数据，探讨AMD流行病学负担，为中国AMD防控提供理论依据。方法: 检索GBD 
2019数据库AMD的患病数/率、伤残调整寿命年(disability-adjusted life 
year，DALYs)、DALY率及中国和全球的社会人口学指数(socio-demographic 
index，SDI)，并统计中国1990年至2019年AMD流行趋势及年龄、时期、性别趋势，研究AMD患病率与SDI之间的关系。结果: 
2019年中国AMD患病率位于全球高水平，患病人数为1990年的1.93倍，患病率及DALY率均持续上升；中国AMD患病人数年龄趋势呈中间高、两头低形态，且女性高于男性。随着SDI值的增加，AMD的发病率呈线性上升趋势。结论: 
通过分析GBD数据库，1990年至2019年间中国AMD疾病负担显著上升，居全球前列，且与社会发展程度呈正相关。积极研究AMD流行病学资料及与社会发展水平的关系，对于AMD诊治、卫生政策制定具有重要意义。.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatitis C virus infection can lead to an enormous health 
burden worldwide. Investigating the changes in HCV-related burden between 
different countries could provide inferences for disease management. Hence, we 
aim to explore the temporal tendency of the disease burden associated with HCV 
infection in China, India, the United States, and the world.
METHODS: Detailed data on the total burden of disease related to HCV infection 
were collected from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 database. Joinpoint 
regression models were used to simulate the optimal joinpoints of annual percent 
changes (APCs). Further analysis of the age composition of each index over time 
and the relationship between ASRs and the socio-demographic Index (SDI) were 
explored. Finally, three factors (population growth, population aging, and 
age-specific changes) were deconstructed for the changes in the number of 
incidences, deaths, and DALYs.
RESULTS: It was estimated that 6.2 million new HCV infections, 0.54 million 
HCV-related deaths, and 15.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2019, with an increase 
of 25.4, 59.1, and 43.6%, respectively, from 1990, are mainly due to population 
growth and aging. China experienced a sharp drop in age-standardized rates in 
2019, the United States showed an upward trend, and India exhibited a 
fluctuating tendency in the burden of disease. The incidence was increasing in 
all locations recently.
CONCLUSION: HCV remains a global health concern despite tremendous progress 
being made. The disease burden in China improved significantly, while the burden 
in the United States was deteriorating, with new infections increasing recently, 
suggesting more targeted interventions to be established to realize the 2030 
elimination goals.

Cleruchoides noackae Lin & Huber (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) was imported to Brazil 
in 2012, to manage the exotic pest Thaumastocoris peregrinus Carpintero & 
Dellapé (Hemiptera: Thaumastocoridae), which has been damaging eucalyptus 
plantations. Knowledge of the thermal requirements and the fertility life table 
of C. noackae is important to improve mass rearing methods for this parasitoid 
and the effectiveness of its release to manage T. peregrinus. The objective was 
to evaluate the development period, thermal requirements and the fertility life 
table of C. noackae at different temperatures. The egg-adult period of this 
parasitoid varied from 43 to 14 days at 15 °C and 30 °C, respectively. The 
emergence of C. noackae adults was higher at 15 °C, 18 °C, 21 °C and 24 °C than 
at 30 °C. Female and male C. noackae need 226.75 and 230.41 degree-days and 
temperatures higher than 10.06 °C and 9.90 °C, respectively, to complete 
egg-adult development. The number of parasitized eggs per C. noackae female was 
higher at 21 °C, 24 °C and 27 °C, with 5.82, 7.73 and 5.50 eggs, respectively, 
than at 30 °C (0.45). Cleruchoides noackae longevity was greater at 15 °C, 21 °C 
and 24 °C. The net reproductive rate of the parasitoid was higher at 21 °C and 
24 °C than at 30 °C, 3.05, 4.70 and 0.16, respectively. The finite rate of 
increase of C. noackae was greater at 21 °C, 24 °C and 27 °C, than at 30 °C and 
the intrinsic rate of increase was negative at 30 °C, -0.100. The temperatures 
21 °C and 24 °C and from 18 °C to 27 °C are the most adequate for the 
reproduction and population increase of C. noackae parasitizing eggs of T. 
peregrinus, respectively.

Khoa and khoa based products (burfi, peda, kalakand, milk cake, etc.) are a 
category of traditional dairy products of Indian subcontinent. They are prepared 
by open pan desiccation along with stirring and scraping of milk to the desired 
consistency, followed by addition of sugar and / or colour and flavoring 
ingredients. The peculiar sensory attributes developed during their course of 
preparation makes them unique, but their short shelf-life is a major challenge 
faced by the dairy industries. They are spoiled mainly because of yeast and mold 
growth along with detrimental changes in the sensory attributes. This review 
describes various preservation techniques explored in the last two decades such 
as packaging interventions, modified atmospheric and active packaging, chemical 
preservation, water activity modification, natural preservation, thermal 
treatments, bio-preservation, etc. which can be used either singly or in 
combination (hurdle technology), to enhance the shelf life of these milk 
products.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between patterns of mid-life to late life 
modifiable risk factors and longevity.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Data collected from the Nurses' Health Study starting in 1984 and the 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study starting in 1986.
PARTICIPANTS: 85 346 participants from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health 
Professionals Follow-up Study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death from any cause by 31 October 2020 for the Nurses' 
Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Risk factors investigated 
were body mass index, physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking status, and 
quality of diet. Trajectories of each risk factor and trajectories of changes in 
the risk factor were identified from baseline with smoothing mixture models, and 
the joint group memberships of participants was used to most efficiently capture 
patterns of the factor over time. For each risk factor, three trajectories 
(patterns with high, medium, and low values) and three trajectories of change in 
the risk factor (patterns with increase, no change, and decrease in the factor 
from baseline) were assumed, giving nine joint patterns: high-stable, 
high-increase, high-decrease, medium-stable, medium-increase, medium-decrease, 
low-stable, low-increase, and low-decrease. Associations between patterns of 
modifiable risk factors and longevity (age at death ≥85 years) and life 
expectancy were examined with logistic regression and accelerated failure time 
models, respectively.
RESULTS: The analysis included 85 346 participants, with 46 042 participants 
achieving longevity and 25 322 participants achieving healthy longevity (those 
who did not have a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or 
cancer). Mean age at baseline was 56 years (standard deviation 5 years). Maximum 
longevity was achieved in participants with a low-stable pattern for body mass 
index (compared with a medium-stable pattern, odds ratio of longevity of 1.05, 
95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.10); those with a medium-increase pattern for 
physical activity (compared with a medium-stable pattern, odds ratio 1.08, 1.01 
to 1.15); those with a medium-stable pattern for alcohol intake (high-increase v 
medium-stable pattern, odds ratio 0.83, 0.74 to 0.93); those who never smoked 
(low-stable v medium-stable pattern, odds ratio 3.09, 2.84 to 3.37); and those 
who with a high-increase pattern for quality of diet (compared with a 
medium-stable pattern, odds ratio 1.09, 1.01 to 1.18). The associations between 
each factor and life expectancy and healthy longevity (no diagnosis of 
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or cancer) were similar to those for 
longevity.
CONCLUSIONS: During mid-life and late life, maximum longevity was achieved in 
participants who maintained a normal body mass index, never smoked, ate a 
healthy diet, and had physical activity levels and alcohol consumption that met 
public health recommendations.

Delay aging, especially in healthy life extension, brought the most interest to 
the medical field. Searching for anti-aging drugs with relative safety profiles 
bring natural products in hotspot. In this study, we find that dioscin promotes 
the health span extension in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans. Through the 
genetic screening in C. elegans, we further reveal that dioscin activates the 
transcription factor SBP-1/SREBP by the UPRER transcription factor XBP-1 to 
upregulate transcription of the Δ9 desaturase FAT-5 and FAT-7, resulting in 
increased monounsaturated fatty acid content which requires for healthy life 
span extension. Intriguingly, through tissue-specific knockdown, we find that 
dioscin modulates the health span by activating SBP-1 in the intestine. 
Unexpectedly, dietary supplementation of POA and OA rescues XBP-1, SBP-1 
mutants-induced shortened life span phenotype. Considering the conservation of 
MUFAs metabolism, dioscin may promote health span in other species, including 
mammals. Our work suggests that dioscin might be a promising candidate for 
developing anti-aging agent.

Inferior mesenteric vein thrombophlebitis is an uncommon condition. Most cases 
of portal-mesenteric thrombophlebitis affect either the portal vein or superior 
mesenteric vein; it is not known why the inferior mesenteric vein is less 
affected. Thrombophlebitis typically occurs following inflammatory 
intra-abdominal processes, such as diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a common 
condition in the Western world, with several common complications, such as 
fistula formation and bowel wall perforation. However, although diverticulitis 
is a common cause of portal-mesenteric thrombophlebitis, thrombophlebitis is 
still a rare complication of diverticulitis. We present a case of diverticulitis 
complicated with interior mesenteric vein thrombophlebitis with gas extension 
into the portal vein.

The unique color and type characteristics of watermelon fruits are regulated by 
many molecular mechanisms. However, it still needs to be combined with more 
abundant genetic data to fine-tune the positioning. We assembled genomes of two 
Korean inbred watermelon lines (cv. 242-1 and 159-1) with unique color and 
fruit-type characteristics and identified 23,921 and 24,451 protein-coding genes 
in the two genomes, respectively. To obtain more precise results for further 
study, we resequenced one individual of each parental line and an F2 population 
composed of 87 individuals. This identified 1,539 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) and 80 InDel markers that provided a high-density genetic 
linkage map with a total length of 3,036.9 cM. Quantitative trait locus mapping 
identified 15 QTLs for watermelon fruit quality-related traits, including
