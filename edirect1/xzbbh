duloxetine with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $43,437. Other 
comparators were dominated. Key drivers included the rates of cardiovascular and 
gastrointestinal adverse events and proton pump inhibitor usage. In subgroup 
analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for duloxetine fell to 
$21,567 for a population 65 years or older and to $18,726 for a population at 
higher risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events.
CONCLUSION: The model estimates that duloxetine is a moderately cost-effective 
treatment for CLBP, becoming more cost-effective for populations older than 65 
years or at greater risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events.

Cartagena, Colombia. nalvis@yahoo.com

OBJECTIVE: Assessing the cost of subsidizing access to household natural gas 
(HNG) and its impact on the health of about 35,000 poor households 
(socioeconomic strata 1 and 2) in Colombia, sponsored by a Global Partnership on 
Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) project.
METHODS: The following studies were combined: an analysis of secondary data and 
analysis of databases provided by the Promigas foundation, demographic data from 
the 2005 DANE census and databases regarding Central Bank economic statistical 
series; an analysis of the burden of disease estimated from parameters 
identified in previous studies; an analysis of the cost of the burden of illness 
and the estimated costs which were avoided by implementing the HNG connections 
program; and an analysis of the cost effectiveness of the program linking homes 
to HNG services.
RESULTS: The OBA project led to about 4,000 to 5,000 cases of acute respiratory 
disease (ARD) and 1,200 to 2,300 outpatient cases of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) being avoided during the study period; around 1,200 
hospitalizations due to ARD and 500 due to COPD were also avoided. Forty-five to 
170 deaths (representing about 45,000 to 90,000 disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY)) were also avoided. The economic cost of the burden of disease arising 
from ARI and COPD in such scenario without HNG would have been between 10.7 and 
23.6 million dollars, whilst HNG led to costs becoming reduced by about 32 %.
CONCLUSIONS: This study was a good estimator of the potential impact of the 
poorest and most vulnerable households gaining universal access to HNG.

The cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the infantile 
form of Pompe disease: comparing a high-income country's approach (England) to 
that of a middle-income one (Colombia).

Policy, London, United Kingdom. hector.castro@lshtm.ac.uk

OBJECTIVES: Determining the cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy 
(ERT) for the classical infantile form of Pompe disease (complete acid 
a-glucosidase deficiency-related) in two different settings: England and 
Colombia. Pompe disease is very rare (1:40,000 births incidence).
METHODS: A literature review was made and historic databases searched for 
National Health Service (NHS) reimbursed costs in England and by health insurers 
in Colombia; expert opinion was elicited. Two Markov models were constructed for 
comparing both countries; alive with symptoms and dead were the transition 
states used. Patients aged < 6 months receiving ERT were assumed to have 75 % 
survival rate and better health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) compared to 
those without treatment (0.700 HR- QoL using the EQ-5D scale).
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained was £234,307.7 for England and £109,991 for Colombia. 
Uncertainty about Anal HR-QoL with ERT, disease progression and cost from 
palliative care had the biggest impact on the ICER in both models. If ERT costs 
were reduced to 10,000 times per dose and HR-QoL was 0.750-0.820 ICER, then 
£165,000 could be attainable for England and £65,000 for Colombia. Transaction 
costs per case in Colombia were high.
CONCLUSIONS: ERT was more effective than no ERT in treating infantile Pompe 
disease, but high levels of uncertainty still remain about survival and 
progression rates and QoL in the long-run. ICERs were high compared to CE 
thresholds. Manufacturers' ERT costs and monopoly had a major impact on Anal CEA 
results.

OBJECTIVES: Determining the burden of cancer in Santander using disability 
adjusted life years (DALY).
METHODS: This was a descriptive study of the disease burden for determining 
DALYs caused by cancer in Santander. The unit of analysis consisted of the 
Autonomous University of Bucaramanga- Population-Based Cancer Centre records and 
National Bureau of Statistics- mortality records for 2005.
RESULTS: The global burden of disease for Santander was estimated at 877 DALY 
per hundred thousand people, 50 being due to disability and 827 to premature 
death. It was seen that premature death DALY (94 %) greatly outweighed 
disability DALY (6 %). The highest DALY values due to premature death in men 
were related to cancer of the stomach (169.8), leukaemia (106.8), colon and the 
rectum (100.4), lymphomas and multiple myelomas (89.9), whilst the highest 
values in women were observed in cervical (122.4), breast (121.9) and stomach 
cancer (94.2) and leukaemia (86.0). The types and cancer sites related to more 
years of life lost (YLL) were the colon and rectum (11.3), breast (6.2), liver 
(6.05) and cervical cancer (5.43).
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of disease from cancer in Santander in 2005 was mainly 
due to premature death YLL in both sexes and all age-groups.

INTRODUCTION: The epidemiological transition model proposed by Omhran at the 
beginning of the 1970s (decreased fecundity rate and increased life expectancy), 
together with modifications in lifestyles and diet, showed increased mortality 
due to chronically degenerative causes. This essay thus discusses and makes a 
comparative analysis of some currents of thought, taking as its common thread an 
analysis of epidemiological change identified in different eras or stages and 
relationships with some public health models or conceptual frameworks.
DISCUSSION: Discussing public health paradigms leads to a historical 
recapitulation of conceptual models ranging from magical-religious conceptions 
to ecological and socio-medical models. M. Susser proposed 3 eras in this 
discipline's evolution in his speech on the future of the epidemiology.
CONCLUSION: The epidemiological changes analysed through different approaches 
constitute elements of analysis that all models discussed in this essay include 
to delimit the contributions and variables so determining them.

Active cognitive lifestyle is associated with positive cognitive health 
transitions and compression of morbidity from age sixty-five.

Cognitive Function and Ageing Study.

Cambridge, United Kingdom. riccardo.marioni@ed.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: Three factors commonly used as measures of cognitive lifestyle are 
education, occupation, and social engagement. This study determined the relative 
importance of each variable to long term cognitive health in those with and 
without severe cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Data came from 12,470 participants from a multi-centre population-based 
cohort (Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study). 
Respondents were aged 65 years and over and were followed-up over 16 years. 
Cognitive states of no impairment, slight impairment, and moderate/severe 
impairment were defined, based on scores from the Mini-Mental State Examination. 
Multi-state modelling was used to investigate links between component cognitive 
lifestyle variables, cognitive state transitions over time, and death.
RESULTS: Higher educational attainment and a more complex mid-life occupation 
were associated with a lower risk of moving from a non-impaired to a slightly 
impaired state (hazard ratios 0.5 and 0.8), but with increased mortality from a 
severely impaired state (1.3 and 1.1). More socially engaged individuals had a 
decreased risk of moving from a slightly impaired state to a moderately/severely 
impaired state (0.7). All three cognitive lifestyle variables were linked to an 
increased chance of cognitive recovery back to the non-impaired state.
CONCLUSIONS: In those without severe cognitive impairment, different aspects of 
cognitive lifestyle predict positive cognitive transitions over time, and in 
those with severe cognitive impairment, a reduced life-expectancy. An active 
cognitive lifestyle is therefore linked to compression of cognitive morbidity in 
late life.

Intrinsic migratory properties of cultured Schwann cells based on single-cell 
migration assay.

Wang Y(1), Teng HL, Huang ZH.

Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.

The migration of Schwann cells is critical for development of peripheral nervous 
system and is essential for regeneration and remyelination after nerve injury. 
Although several factors have been identified to regulate Schwann cell 
migration, intrinsic migratory properties of Schwann cells remain elusive. In 
this study, based on time-lapse imaging of single isolated Schwann cells, we 
examined the intrinsic migratory properties of Schwann cells and the molecular 
cytoskeletal machinery of soma translocation during migration. We found that 
cultured Schwann cells displayed three motile phenotypes, which could transform 
into each other spontaneously during their migration. Local disruption of 
F-actin polymerization at leading front by a Cytochalasin D or Latrunculin A 
gradient induced collapse of leading front, and then inhibited soma 
translocation. Moreover, in migrating Schwann cells, myosin II activity 
displayed a polarized distribution, with the leading process exhibiting higher 
expression than the soma and trailing process. Decreasing this front-to-rear 
difference of myosin II activity by frontal application of a ML-7 or BDM (myosin 
II inhibitors) gradient induced the collapse of leading front and reversed soma 
translocation, whereas, increasing this front-to-rear difference of myosin II 
activity by rear application of a ML-7 or BDM gradient or frontal application of 
a Caly (myosin II activator) gradient accelerated soma translocation. Taken 
together, these results suggest that during migration, Schwann cells display 
malleable motile phenotypes and the extension of leading front dependent on 
F-actin polymerization pulls soma forward translocation mediated by myosin II 
activity.

Treating HIV-1 Infection: What Might the Future Hold?

Lichterfeld M(1), Zachary KC.

Author information:

Cox 5, Boston, MA 02114, USA.

Advances in antiretroviral combination therapy lasting the past two decades have 
transformed HIV-1 infection from a fatal disease into a chronic medical 
condition that in many cases does not compromise life quality. There are 25 
different antiretroviral agents available currently, allowing for 
patient-centered, individualized management of HIV-1 infection, and ongoing 
progress in HIV-1 virology and antiretroviral pharmacology is likely to expand 
treatment options further in the future. Nevertheless, antiretroviral therapy 
continues to have limitations, including insufficient immunological 
reconstitution, selection of drug resistance, ongoing abnormal immune activation 
despite effective suppression of HIV-1 viremia, and the inability to target 
latently infected cells that are responsible for long-term viral persistence. 
Owing to these shortcomings, the theoretical ability of antiretroviral therapy 
to extend life expectancy to normal levels is not realized in many cases. 
Strategies to address these limitations are a matter of active ongoing research 
and will be summarized in this article.

Paulo, Brazil. jrlauris@fob.usp.br

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine changes in values on the 
decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) index in 12-year-old children in Brazil 
between 1980 and 2005, and to correlate DMFT values with human development index 
(HDI) values, time, population size of municipality and fluoridation of the 
water supply.
METHODS: The present study represents a retrospective ecological study using 
secondary data from epidemiological surveys published in indexed journals, as 
well as data obtained from epidemiological official surveys carried out in 
Brazil in 1986, 1996 and 2003, and in the State of São Paulo in 1998 and 2002. 
Units of study were represented by Brazilian municipalities holding average DMFT 
index values for 12-year-old children. Multiple regression analysis was used to 
examine the correlations among DMFT and HDI values, and time, population size 
and fluoridation of the water supply.
RESULTS: The final database included 550 records of DMFT values in 428 different 
towns. Regression analysis showed statistically significant correlations between 
DMFT index values and time (P < 0.001), fluoridation of the water supply (P < 
0.001) and size of municipality (P < 0.001). Estimated mean DMFT index values 
were 8.36 in 1980, 6.08 in 1985, 4.45 in 1990, 3.29 in 1995, 2.46 in 2000 and 
1.86 in 2005.
CONCLUSIONS: Data showed a significant decrease in dental caries across the 
entire country, with an average reduction of 25% occurring every 5 years. 
General trends indicated that a reduction in DMFT index values occurred over 
time, that a further reduction in DMFT index values occurred when a municipality 
fluoridated its water supply, and mean DMFT index values were lower in larger 
than in smaller municipalities.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is an important modifiable risk factor for 
noncommunicable disease. The degree to which physical activity affects the life 
expectancy of Americans is unknown.
PURPOSE: This study estimated the potential years of life gained due to 
leisure-time physical activity in the U.S.
METHODS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(2007-2010); National Health Interview Study mortality linkage (1990-2006); and 
U.S. Life Tables (2006) were used to estimate and compare life expectancy at 
each age of adult life for inactive (no moderate to vigorous physical activity); 
somewhat-active (some moderate to vigorous activity but <500 MET minutes/week); 
and active (≥ 500 MET minutes/week of moderate to vigorous activity) adults. 
Analyses were conducted in 2012.
RESULTS: Somewhat-active and active non-Hispanic white men had a life expectancy 
at age 20 years that was ~2.4 years longer than that for the inactive men; this 
life expectancy advantage was 1.2 years at age 80 years. Similar observations 
were made in non-Hispanic white women, with a higher life expectancy within the 
active category of 3.0 years at age 20 years and 1.6 years at age 80 years. In 
non-Hispanic black women, as many as 5.5 potential years of life were gained due 
to physical activity. Significant increases in longevity were also observed 
within somewhat-active and active non-Hispanic black men; however, among 
Hispanics the years-of-life-gained estimates were not significantly different 
from 0 years gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Leisure-time physical activity is associated with increases in 
longevity.

An evaluation of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief effect on health 
systems strengthening in sub-Saharan Africa.

Spring, MD †Military HIV Research Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of 
Research, Silver Spring, MD.

BACKGROUND: President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has been 
criticized for its vertical or "stove-piping" structure, with resources 
targeting a specific disease rather than working to strengthen the underlying 
health system. This study aimed to evaluate whether PEPFAR activities were 
associated with system-wide improvements in both proximal and distal indicators 
of health systems strengthening.
METHODS: The World Bank database provided 12 indicators of health systems 
strengthening that were analyzed for their relationship to PEPFAR. Poisson and 
linear regression models were used to estimate the time trend. We evaluated the 
PEPFAR impact on health outcomes by comparing the time trend in each of the 
above indicators between 2 time periods: from 1995 to 2002 (pre-PEPFAR) and from 
2004 to 2010 (during PEPFAR).
RESULTS: PEPFAR activities showed strong and statistically significant 
associations with improvements in proximal indicators of health systems 
strengthening, those related directly to HIV, specifically life expectancy (P = 
0.003) and tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality (P < 0.0001). There 
were nonsignificant associations between PEPFAR and improvements in distal 
indicators of health systems strengthening, namely infant mortality and under 5 
child mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The progressive scale-up of PEPFAR-supported activities was 
associated with consistent improvements in proximal indicators of health systems 
strengthening. It was also associated with improvements in broader measures of 
health system strength, most clearly life expectancy. Given the limited number 
of health measures available for this type of analysis, more data must be 
collected for other indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of the many 
multibillion dollar global health initiatives.

Mortality attributable to smoking among HIV-1-infected individuals: a 
nationwide, population-based cohort study.

Helleberg M(1), Afzal S, Kronborg G, Larsen CS, Pedersen G, Pedersen C, Gerstoft 
J, Nordestgaard BG, Obel N.

Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. mhelleberg@sund.ku.dk

BACKGROUND: We assessed mortality attributable to smoking among patients with 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
METHODS: We estimated mortality rates (MRs), mortality rate ratios (MRRs), life 
expectancies, life-years lost, and population-attributable risk of death 
associated with smoking and with HIV among current and nonsmoking individuals 
from a population-based, nationwide HIV cohort and a cohort of matched 
HIV-negative individuals.
RESULTS: A total of 2921 HIV patients and 10 642 controls were followed for 14 
281 and 45 122 person-years, respectively. All-cause and non-AIDS-related 
mortality was substantially increased among smoking compared to nonsmoking HIV 
patients (MRR, 4.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.0-6.7] and 5.3 [95% CI, 
3.2-8.8], respectively). Excess MR per 1000 person-years among current vs 
nonsmokers was 17.6 (95% CI, 13.3-21.9) for HIV patients and 4.8 (95% CI, 
3.2-6.4) for controls. A 35-year-old HIV patient had a median life expectancy of 
62.6 years (95% CI, 59.9-64.6) for smokers and 78.4 years (95% CI, 70.8-84.0) 
for nonsmokers; the numbers of life-years lost in association with smoking and 
HIV were 12.3 (95% CI, 8.1-16.4) and 5.1 (95% CI, 1.6-8.5). The 
population-attributable risk of death associated with smoking was 61.5% among 
HIV patients and 34.2% among controls.
CONCLUSIONS: In a setting where HIV care is well organized and antiretroviral 
therapy is free of charge, HIV-infected smokers lose more life-years to smoking 
than to HIV. The excess mortality of smokers is tripled and the 
population-attributable risk of death associated with smoking is doubled among 
HIV patients compared to the background population.

The health of the Mexican population is influenced by several demographic 
transitions and has a direct impact on the health of the population, which is 
reflected in the increase of chronic degenerative diseases, as it has reduced 
the infant mortality rate and increased life expectancy. Although Mexican health 
system has implemented various campaigns for prevention, treatment and control 
of infectious and chronic degenerative diseases, it is necessary to generate a 
transformation in the promotion and prevention strategies to shift from the 
curative to preventive medicine.

and Allied Sciences, PO Box 65015, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

In this commentary we introduce the population age and gender distributions, the 
birth rate, and life expectancy in Tanzania's largely agricultural society and 
highlight the vulnerable status of mothers and children. We present underlying 
causes of poor health, the leading causes of Disability-Adjusted Life Years and 
review threats from exposure to disease, toxic substances, and injuries that 
require protection of populations and control efforts. We summarize health 
challenges posed by malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, non-communicable 
diseases, and by new threats that may change the picture of disease and require 
adjustments in how training institutions prepare the health workforce.

Which patient groups should be asked to participate in first-in-human trials of 
stem-cell-based therapies?

Hug K(1), Hermerén G.

Author information:
(1)Department of Medical Ethics, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Lund, 
Sweden. Kristina.Hug@med.lu.se

The aims of this article are to consider (1) whether there are medical and 
societal differences among diseases regarding which patient groups should be 
asked to participate in first-in-human (FIH) trials of stem-cell-based 
therapies; (2) any differences in the light of values generally endorsed by 
different types of ethical theories, since the question in the title of this 
article is value laden, and its answer depends on which values one wants to 
promote and protect, and how they are ranked in importance; (3) whether the 
answer to that question is disease-specific, or whether it depends on factors 
common to several diseases. To illustrate these problems, we use Parkinson's 
disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), between which there are important 
medical and societal differences. Moreover, research on stem-cell-based 
therapies for these diseases is being translated from research to practice. This 
approach to the problem can be applied to decision making about similar problems

BACKGROUND: Studies with the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans have 
identified conserved biochemical pathways that act to modulate life span. Life 
span can also be influenced by the composition of the intestinal microbiome, and 
C. elegans life span can be dramatically influenced by its diet of Escherichia 
coli. Although C. elegans is typically fed the standard OP50 strain of E. coli, 
nematodes fed E. coli strains rendered respiratory deficient, either due to a 
lack coenzyme Q or the absence of ATP synthase, show significant life span 
extension. Here we explore the mechanisms accounting for the enhanced nematode 
life span in response to these diets.
RESULTS: The intestinal load of E. coli was monitored by determination of 
worm-associated colony forming units (cfu/worm or coliform counts) as a function 
of age. The presence of GFP-expressing E. coli in the worm intestine was also 
monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Worms fed the standard OP50 E. coli strain 
have high cfu and GFP-labeled bacteria in their guts at the L4 larval stage, and 
show saturated coliform counts by day five of adulthood. In contrast, nematodes 
fed diets of respiratory deficient E. coli lacking coenzyme Q lived 
significantly longer and failed to accumulate bacteria within the lumen at early 
ages. Animals fed bacteria deficient in complex V showed intermediate coliform 
numbers and were not quite as long-lived. The results indicate that respiratory 
deficient Q-less E. coli are effectively degraded in the early adult worm, 
either at the pharynx or within the intestine, and do not accumulate in the 
intestinal tract until day ten of adulthood.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the nematodes fed the 
respiratory deficient E. coli diet live longer because the delay in bacterial 
colonization of the gut subjects the worms to less stress compared to worms fed 
the OP50 E. coli diet. This work suggests that bacterial respiration can act as 
a virulence factor, influencing the ability of bacteria to colonize and 
subsequently harm the animal host. Respiratory deficient bacteria may pose a 
useful model for probing probiotic relationships within the gut microbiome in 
higher organisms.

BACKGROUND: Primary liver cancer is one of the most commonly seen tumors in 
clinical practice. Due to the stealthiness and fast progress of liver cancer, 
only 20% of the patients may have chance to receive operation for radical 
therapy. Patients seldom get benefit from systematic chemotherapy and as a 
result, local chemotherapy methods such as transarterial chemoembolization 
(TACE) have become the mainstay in the treatment of liver cancer. Compared with 
systematic chemotherapy, TACE produces fewer side effects and most of such side 
effects are caused by postembolization syndrome manifested as nausea and 
vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite, etc.
OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, effects of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) 
in relieving side effects caused by TACE in patients with liver cancer were 
evaluated and meta-analysis was conducted when possible.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Literature search was conducted on August 23rd, 2011. The 
Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE 
(Ovid SP), and Science Citation Index Expanded, China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure Database, Chongqing VIP Database and Wanfang Data were searched 
with no time limits.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of CHM for TACE-induced 
side effects in patients with primary liver cancer were eligible for this 
review, regardless of blinding, language, or publication status.
DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Search results were screened to select the trials 
included in this review according to the inclusion criteria, and data were 
extracted from all the included RCTs by using a self-developed data extraction 
form. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies was conducted according to 
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention (Version 5.0.2): 
Criteria for judging risk of bias in the "risk of bias" assessment tool. 
Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratio with its 95% confidence interval 
(CI). Continuous outcomes were expressed as mean differences with 95% CI. If 
there was no significant heterogeneity, the results from the fixed-effect model 
were presented. If the heterogeneity was not substantial, the results from the 
random-effect model were presented. If the heterogeneity was substantial, a 
meta-analysis was not performed and a narrative, qualitative summary was 
performed instead. In the event of substantial clinical, methodological, or 
statistical heterogeneity, the trial components such as patients, diseases, 
interventions, comparisons, and outcomes in the included trials were reviewed to 
decide the reason for heterogeneity.
RESULTS: A total of 47 RCTs were included in this review after screening the 
search results. Among them, 46 were in Chinese and 1 was in English; 43 were 
journal articles and 4 were academic dissertations; all the authors were from 
mainland China and all the trials were conducted in mainland China. The results 
of assessment of risk of bias showed that there was unclear or high risk of bias 
in most of the included RCTs and thus they were all with low quality. The 
results of systematic evaluation and meta-analysis showed that CHM was 
beneficial to patients with liver cancer in prolonging life expectancy, 
improving quality of life, reducing side effects of TACE such as nausea and 
vomiting, fever, liver pain, and bone marrow suppression, improving liver 
function indexes and immunological indexes, and enhancing objective curative 
effect on the tumor size. However, due to the substantial heterogeneity 
presented in most of the indexes, only descriptive analysis was conducted for 
these indexes. The results of the heterogeneity analysis showed that the causes 
of substantial heterogeneity may be due to the obvious difference in treatment 
protocol, components and dosage form of CHM, time for delivering drugs and 
course of treatment.
CONCLUSION: CHM is effective in prolonging life expectancy, improving quality of 
life, and reducing side effects of TACE in the treatment of liver cancer. 
However, due to the undesirable quality of the included RCTs and the substantial 
heterogeneity, most of the outcome measure indexes were failed to be 
meta-analyzed, and thus the significance of this review for clinical practice 
was limited.

Hepatocellular carcinoma with obstructive jaundice: endoscopic and percutaneous 
biliary drainage.

Medicine, 377-2 Ohno-Higashi, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan.

Among patients with later stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), only 1-12% 
manifest obstructive jaundice as the initial complaint. Endoscopic retrograde 
biliary drainage (ERBD) and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) 
are the two main non-surgical treatment options for obstructive jaundice in 
patients with HCC. ERBD is usually the first-line treatment because of its low 
hemorrhage risk. Some have reported that the successful drainage rate ranges 
from 72 to 100%. Mean stent patency time and mean survival range from 1.0 to 
15.9 and 2.8 to 12.3 months, respectively. PTBD is often an important 
second-line treatment when ERBD is impossible. With regard to materials, 
metallic stents offer the benefit of longer patency than plastic stents. The 
dominant effect of biliary drainage suggests that successful jaundice therapy 
could enhance anti-cancer treatment by increasing life expectancy, decreasing 
mortality, or both. We present an overview of the efficacy of endoscopic and 
percutaneous drainage for obstructive jaundice in patients with HCC who are not 
candidates for surgical resection and summarize the current indications and 
outcomes of reported clinical use.

Lipoid proteinosis (LP) is a rare, autosomal-recessive disease characterized by 
the hoarseness and widespread cutaneous scarring, more prominent on sun-exposed 
areas. Yellow-white plaques can be seen on oral mucosa and on the skin among 
depressed scars. Histological evaluation of the affected sites shows 
accumulation of hyaline-like material in dermis and disruption of basement 
membrane. Although LP is compatible with normal life expectancy, involvement of 
upper respiratory tract may endanger patient's life, especially in the case of a 
respiratory tract infection. Involvement of central nervous system has also been 
reported, but its clinical importance is obscure. Due to the rarity of LP, a 
definite therapeutical approach is not established. In this paper we describe a 
21-year-old LP patient who was treated with acitretin for six months. Although 
the outcome with cutaneous lesions was not satisfactory, her hoarseness was 
significantly improved.

Children affected by mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IH (Hurler Syndrome), an 
autosomal recessive metabolic disorder, are known to experience a range of 
musculoskeletal manifestations including spinal abnormalities, hand 
abnormalities, generalised joint stiffness, genu valgum, and hip dysplasia and 
avascular necrosis. Enzyme therapy, in the form of bone marrow transplantation, 
significantly increases life expectancy but does not prevent the development of 
the associated musculoskeletal disorders. We present the case of a 23-year-old 
woman with a diagnosis of Hurler syndrome with a satisfactory result following 
uncemented total hip arthroplasty.

Analysis of prospective data collected between 1984 and 2008 by the CERN medical 
team (European Centre of Nuclear Research, Geneva) concerning 2040 former 
employees who were retired or had died stimulated our interest on the impact of 
inequalities in socioeconomic conditions, employment, lifestyle and classical 
risk factors on health and life expectancy. Such inequalities explain 
differences in life expectancy, potentially reaching several decades, between 
rich and poor countries (France vs Swaziland), but also within a given country 
(USA), a given city (Glasgow) or even a given enterprise (CERN) where all 
employees have the same level of healthcare insurance and access to treatment. 
Classical cardiovascular and neurovascular risk factors (smoking, arterial 
hypertension and lipid disorders) interact with socioeconomic status, 
intelligence, education, emotions and job responsibility/complexity, 
precipitating or preventing cardiovascular events. The same is true of dementia, 
for which midlife risk factors (obesity, arterial hypertension and 
hypercholesterolemia) should be considered in the psychosocioeconomic context, 
which influences cognitive reserves and thus affects the risk and severity of 
dementia in old age. Thus, in addition to lifestyle and classical risk factors, 
socioeconomic status appears as a major health determinant, by imposing 
behaviors and habits and by determining access to healthcare.

Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men and its 
incidence has been increasing in the last decades. Diagnosis and treatment of 
prostate cancer were radically improved after the discovery of 
prostatic-specific antigen. Early detection rates increased, especially in 
asymptomatic individuals, confirmed by recent published randomized trials. The 
impact of screening in overdiagnosis and overtreatments is discussed, since 
benefits in overall mortality rates were not clearly demonstrated. Perhaps 
younger patients with a longer life expectancy would be the ones with the most 
benefits from screening. This study presents an update of the most important 
screening methods for prostate cancer as well as the recent recommendations for 
screening.

Cardiovascular disease is multidimensional and new ideas are needed to develop 
the conventional risk factor paradigm that has been based on the Framingham 
Heart Study since more than 30 years. Traditional risk factors such as 
hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia and diabetes can only explain about 50% of 
the distribution of coronary heart disease whereas the inclusion of new risk 
markers or protective markers may increase the explained proportion up to 80% of 
myocardial infarction risk according to the INTERHEART study. Still there are 
substantial differences in cardiovascular risk between regions and populations 
that are hard to explain. Findings in the former Soviet Union geographical area 
in Eastern Europe could contribute to new and better understanding of 
cardiovascular risk as a reflection of ageing in general, as populations in 
these areas not only run a very high cardiovascular risk but also have a shorter 
mean life expectancy in general. New understanding of the interaction between 
genes and the environment in prediction of cardiovascular ageing could 
contribute to the development of more effective preventive strategies.

Osteoporosis: an update.

USA. stephen.honig@nyumc.org

The past year has been a dynamic one for clinicians and researchers with an 
interest in osteoporosis. This update will focus on the issue of the 
relationship between bisphosphonate treatment and atypical femoral fractures, 
highlight the advances in imaging techniques that are increasingly being studied 
as adjuncts to bone density testing, and explore recent evidence that suggests 
that osteoporosis medications may be linked to an increase in life expectancy. 
Since the first case reports describing unusual femur fractures in long term 
users of bisphosphonates began to appear, there has been great interest in 
identifying why and whether this class of drug can cause these atypical 
fractures. There have been a significant number of large studies that seem to 
suggest that these fractures do occur with an increased frequency among subjects 
who have used bisphosphonates over an extended period of time, but that these 
events are relatively rare. The occurrence of these fractures have helped to 
fashion new treatment regimens with periods of "drug holidays" often recommended 
to people with lower short-term and intermediate-term fracture risk. It is 
important to remind the reader that bisphosphonates prevent many typical hip and 
vertebral compression fractures, particularly in the higher risk elderly patient 
and that a rational balance be struck so that those in need of continued 
osteoporosis treatment receive it. Advances in imaging, such as high resolution 
MRI and peripheral micro CT scanners, are allowing investigators to 
non-invasively assess bone microarchitecture and bone stiffness of individuals 
as a means of trying to more accurately define those subjects who might be at 
increased risk of fracture and who might benefit from bone strengthening 
medication. Finally, this update will briefly review the emerging data that 
suggests that anti-resorptive medication may extend life expectancy beyond that 
which can be expected solely by reducing the incidence of future fractures.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have established Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) 
losses associated with mental and chronic physical conditions in the community. 
The aim of the current study was to establish and compare the QALY losses 
associated with select mental and chronic physical conditions in Singapore.
METHODS: The Singapore Mental Health Study was a cross-sectional epidemiological 
survey of a nationally representative sample. The diagnosis of psychiatric 
disorders was established using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 
(CIDI 3.0) and health related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the 
Euro-Qol-5D (EQ-5D).
RESULTS: Pain conditions, hypertension and MDD were associated with the highest 
loss of QALYs in Singapore at a population level. The marginal effect on HRQoL 
by - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and 
Bipolar Disorder was higher than the effect of any physical condition.
LIMITATIONS: The presence of chronic physical diseases was established using a 
check-list rather than with more objective measures and UK tariffs were used as 
local tariffs are not available and this might introduce some cultural bias.
CONCLUSIONS: QALY losses associated with psychiatric disorders were high, 
emphasizing the need for recognizing them as major public health concerns and 
the need for appropriate resource allocation.

Airborne biological particles containing viruses, bacteria, and/or fungi can be 
toxic and cause infections and allergy symptoms. Recently, natural materials 
such as tea tree oil and Sophora flavescens have shown promising antimicrobial 
activity when applied as air filter media. Although many of these studies 
demonstrated excellent antimicrobial efficacy, only a few of them considered 
external environmental effects such as the surrounding humidity, temperature, 
and natural degradation of chemicals, all of which can affect the antimicrobial 
performance of these natural materials. In this study, we investigated the 
antimicrobial durability of air filters containing airborne nanoparticles from 
S. flavescens for 5 months. Antimicrobial tests and quantitative chemical
