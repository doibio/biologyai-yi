patients with peripheral vascular disease was robust. Evaluations of stroke and 
myocardial infarction patients were sensitive predominantly to the cost and 
efficacy of clopidogrel, with aspirin therapy more effective and less expensive 
in 153 of 1000 simulations (15.3%) in poststroke patients and clopidogrel more 
effective in 119 of 1000 simulations (11.9%) in the myocardial infarction 
sample.
CONCLUSION: Clopidogrel provides a substantial increase in quality-adjusted life 
expectancy at a cost that is within traditional societal limits for patients 
with either peripheral arterial disease or a recent stroke. Current evidence 
does not support increased efficacy with clopidogrel relative to aspirin in 
patients following myocardial infarction.

Is revascularization and limb salvage always the treatment for critical limb 
ischemia?

Nehler MR, Peyton BD.

Despite marked advances in the technical ability to perform lower extremity 
revascularization, the decision whether to perform primary amputation or attempt 
revascularization in high risk patients is a major part of modern vascular care. 
With an aging population and improved medical care that has increased life 
expectancy, more patients with severe systemic disease are presenting with 
critical limb ischemia (CLI). In addition, it is well recognized that CLI 
patients suffer diagnostic delays and poor risk factor modification, which in 
part contributes to limb loss and poor patient survival. Unlike other disease 
entities, CLI does not have a clear clinical pattern that provides consistent 
entry to medical care and uniform treatment algorithm. In this commentary we 
will discuss the issue from several viewpoints. The unique features of the 
antecedent natural history of CLI will be presented. Available data on 
functional outcomes on both therapies for CLI will be presented. Morbidity and 
mortality of both approaches will be covered, including the risk of multiple 
procedures, followed by an examination of specific problematic patient 
populations. Finally, we will close with some potential approaches to these 
problems and future studies that are needed to push forward our ability to 
appropriately make these difficult decisions for an increasingly aging 
population.

The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Part II. A cost-effectiveness 
analysis for invasive disease in the elderly in England and Wales.

Surveillance Centre, London NW9 5EQ, UK. alessia.melegaro@hpa.org.uk

The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) has been available for a 
number of years and is recommended for high-risk categories. Relatively 
immunocompetent elderly people are not included in this group, although their 
probability of getting invasive pneumococcal infection is high. The objective of 
this study was to assess whether vaccinating all elderly people over 65 years of 
age was a cost-effective policy for England and Wales. The analysis was 
performed comparing the cost and health effects produced by vaccination, to what 
would have been occurred if vaccination were not introduced. A decision analysis 
model was used in order to predict health outcomes under different vaccination 
scenarios. Unit costs were applied to the outcome and the cost per life-year 
gained was calculated. Sensitivity analysis was performed to allow for uncertain 
parameters to vary. The current UK recommendation does not appear to be the most 
cost-effective strategy due to the low level of efficacy of the vaccine in 
high-risk groups (HRG) and their shorter life expectancy. Routine vaccination of 
all elderly appears to be more cost-effective. These results are, nevertheless, 
very much dependent on the uncertainties around vaccine efficacy estimates, 
which appear to be still present, especially in HRG, and on the number of 
hospitalisations and deaths attributable to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).

Determining and overcoming resistance to HIV protease inhibitors.

HIV protease represents a major target for development of antiviral 
therapeutics. The introduction of HIV protease (PR) inhibitors (PIs) to clinical 
practice and the application of highly active antiretroviral therapy resulted in 
decreased mortality and prolonged life expectancy of HIV-positive patients. 
However, the high polymorphism of HIV leads to rapid selection of viral variants 
resistant towards the inhibitors. Such resistant PR variants have developed in 
HIV-positive patients after treatment with any of the eight PIs approved for 
clinical use. In this review we overview (i) the methods for the identification 
and assessment of viral resistance in HIV positive patients, and (ii) the 
approaches medicinal chemists take to overcome it. Rational antiviral therapy 
brings about the need for quantitative assessment of the level of drug 
resistance development in the course of the treatment. At present, two main 
approaches are taken: in genotypic assays the viral sequences are PCR amplified, 
sequenced and changes in the viral gene sequence known to be associated with 
reduced drug sensitivity are identified, while phenotypic assays test the 
ability of a virus to grow in the presence of a drug or combination of drugs. 
The advantages and drawbacks of these methods, as well as their relevance for 
the therapy are discussed. We also review the efforts to design 
second-generation PIs, capable of potently inhibiting multi-resistant HIV-1 PR 
species, using structure-assisted design of the compounds targeted to the active 
site, as well as alternative approaches with compounds binding to other domains 
of the PR molecule.

Re-examination of the cost-effectiveness of surgical versus medical therapy in 
patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease: the value of long-term data 
collection.

OBJECTIVES: For patients with reflux esophagitis, long-term therapeutic options 
include proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and/or antireflux surgery. An 
earlier cost-effectiveness analysis concluded that at 5 yr, medical therapy was 
less expensive but similarly effective to fundoplication, but the results were 
sensitive to estimates on quality of life and long-term medication usage, which 
were derived from "expert opinion." Recently, data from randomized controlled 
trials addressing these variables have become available. We have incorporated 
these new data into a revised Markov model to examine the cost-effectiveness of 
surgical versus medical therapy in patients with severe reflux esophagitis.
METHODS: A Markov simulation model was constructed using specialized software 
(DATA PRO 4.0, Williamstown, MA). Total expected costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years were calculated for long-term medical therapy and for laparoscopic 
Nissen fundoplication. Probabilities were obtained from the medical literature 
using Medline. Procedural and hospitalization costs used were the average 
Medicare reimbursements at our institution. Medication costs were the average 
wholesale price. The analysis was extended over a 10-yr time horizon at a 
discount rate of 3%.
RESULTS: The discounted analysis shows that medical therapy is associated with 
total costs of 8,798 dollars and 4.59 quality-adjusted life-years, whereas the 
surgical strategy is more expensive (10,475 dollars) and less effective (4.55 
quality-adjusted life-years). The results were robust to most one-way 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term medical therapy with proton pump inhibitors is the 
preferred strategy for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and severe 
esophagitis. Our study highlights the importance of using primary, 
patient-derived data rather than expert opinion.

Medical consequences of obesity.

Bray GA(1).

brayga@pbrc.edu

Obesity is an epidemic disease that threatens to inundate health care resources 
by increasing the incidence of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and 
cancer. These effects of obesity result from two factors: the increased mass of 
adipose tissue and the increased secretion of pathogenetic products from 
enlarged fat cells. This concept of the pathogenesis of obesity as a disease 
allows an easy division of disadvantages of obesity into those produced by the 
mass of fat and those produced by the metabolic effects of fat cells. In the 
former category are the social disabilities resulting from the stigma associated 
with obesity, sleep apnea that results in part from increased parapharyngeal fat 
deposits, and osteoarthritis resulting from the wear and tear on joints from 
carrying an increased mass of fat. The second category includes the metabolic 
factors associated with distant effects of products released from enlarged fat 
cells. The insulin-resistant state that is so common in obesity probably 
reflects the effects of increased release of fatty acids from fat cells that are 
then stored in the liver or muscle. When the secretory capacity of the pancreas 
is overwhelmed by battling insulin resistance, diabetes develops. The strong 
association of increased fat, especially visceral fat, with diabetes makes this 
consequence particularly ominous for health care costs. The release of 
cytokines, particularly IL-6, from the fat cell may stimulate the 
proinflammatory state that characterizes obesity. The increased secretion of 
prothrombin activator inhibitor-1 from fat cells may play a role in the 
procoagulant state of obesity and, along with changes in endothelial function, 
may be responsible for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and 
hypertension. For cancer, the production of estrogens by the enlarged stromal 
mass plays a role in the risk for breast cancer. Increased cytokine release may 
play a role in other forms of proliferative growth. The combined effect of these 
pathogenetic consequences of increased fat stores is an increased risk of 
shortened life expectancy.

Residual lung damage after completion of treatment for multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis.

Missouri 63110, USA. devalls@slu.edu

SETTING: Limpopo Province, South Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the residual lung damage of patients who completed 
treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
DESIGN: Chest radiograph and lung function tests were performed at the end of 
treatment. The radiographs were read by two independent observers who attributed 
a zonal score of between 0 and 18, depending on the extent of radiographic 
abnormalities (opacification or cavitation), counted the number of visible 
cavities and measured the diameter of the largest cavity.
RESULTS: The mean zonal score was 6.5. Cavitation was present in more than half 
of the patients. Of 33 patients, 31 (94%) had abnormal lung function tests. The 
median FEV1 was 63% and FVC was 57% of the predicted value. Restrictive and 
combined restrictive-obstructive lung function patterns were the predominant 
abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Residual lung damage in MDR-TB patients who completed treatment is 
common and extensive. This may increase the risk of relapse of tuberculosis and 
reduce the quality of life and life expectancy of these patients. Additional 
efforts are warranted to diagnose MDR-TB early to reduce the extent of residual 
lung damage. Close follow-up of MDR-TB patients completing treatment will have 
to be ensured to detect relapses.

The relative survival of COPD patients on long-term oxygen therapy in Australia: 
A comparative study.

(1)Respiratory Unit, Flinders Medical Centre and Flinders University, Bedford 
Park, Australia. jo.cranston@fmc.sa.gov.au

OBJECTIVE: The survival of patients with COPD on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) 
has been studied using both univariate and multivariate procedures. There has 
been only one previous report of relative survival. Relative survival takes into 
account the risk of death due to increasing age. The objective of this study was 
to determine the relative survival of a group of South Australian patients 
prescribed home oxygen therapy for COPD.
METHODOLOGY: A method proposed by Hakulinen was used to determine relative 
survival. The results were compared with the relative survival of a similar 
group of French COPD patients.
RESULTS: A total of 505 COPD patients (249 males, 256 females) were included in 
the survival analysis. Relative survival corrected for life expectancy was 
78.1%, 56.7%, 23.1% and 1.1% at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years, respectively, which was 
less than that reported in a recent French study of comparable patients. Our 
patients were similar with respect to age, severity of hypoxaemia and oxygen 
usage to those in the French study.
CONCLUSIONS: Using relative survival analysis, Australian LTOT patients with 
COPD have worse outcomes than some European patients. Factors contributing to 
the excess mortality in South Australian COPD patients need to be investigated.

Hormonal fountains of youth.

Horani MH(1), Morley JE.

63104, USA.

Any hope of a fountain of youth to stop people from getting older is a long way 
off, with science just beginning to understand the complex genetic, physical, 
and hormonal causes of aging. Clearly, modem research has demonstrated that the 
concept of a hormonal fountain of youth is predominantly mythology. The best 
evidence supporting use of hormonal replacement is vitamin D and estrogen 
replacement to prevent hip fractures. Other than that, treatment should be 
limited to hormone replacement in persons who have endocrine disease.

Retrospective analysis of the age at death in two heavily polluted and two 
unpolluted Russian towns.

Turku, Finland. mikoz@utu.fi

Mean age at death during 1981-1999 was recorded in four small industrial towns 
located in the Kola Peninsula, north-western Russia. Two of these towns (Nikel 
and Monchegorsk) are heavily contaminated by sulphur dioxide and toxic metals 
(primarily Ni, Cu, Cd) emitted by large nickel-copper smelters; two other towns 
(Apatity and Polyarnye Zori) are nearly unpolluted. The results did not support 
the hypothesis that human life span is significantly shorter in the contaminated 
communities; moreover, mean age at death was lowest in Polyarnye Zori, the town 
not polluted by either sulfur dioxide or heavy metals but located close to the 
nuclear power plant. It seems that the impact of hazards other than pollution 
(both social and environmental), which are common for the populations of the 
investigated towns, shorten the life span so much that the contribution of 
pollutants to the decline in life expectancy cannot be detected. However, the 
relative importance of the life-shortening diseases associated with pollution 
may increase with the (expected) improvement of the quality of life.

(1)Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle, UK.

BACKGROUND: The amyloid precursor protein (APP) locus on chromosome 21 
influences the development of Alzheimer disease.
METHOD: The authors investigated the relationship between a tetranucleotide 
repeat on intron 7 of the APP gene and the age at onset of dementia in Down 
syndrome (DS).
RESULTS: There was a 13-year difference in the age at onset of dementia in DS 
associated with the number of tetranucleotide repeat alleles in APP.
CONCLUSION: APP is an important locus predicting the age at onset of dementia in 
people with Down syndrome.

The high risk of stroke immediately after transient ischemic attack: a 
population-based study.

Author information:
(1)Calgary Stroke Program, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of 
Calgary, Canada. michael.hill@calgaryhealthregion.ca

BACKGROUND: The risk of stroke is elevated in the first 48 hours after TIA. 
Previous prognostic models suggest that diabetes mellitus, age, and clinical 
symptomatology predict stroke. The authors evaluated the magnitude of risk of 
stroke and predictors of stroke after TIA in an entire population over time.
METHODS: Administrative data from four different databases were used to define 
TIA and stroke for the entire province of Alberta for the fiscal year (April 
1999-March 2000). The age-adjusted incidence of TIA was estimated using direct 
standardization to the 1996 Canadian population. The risk of stroke after a 
diagnosis of TIA in an Alberta emergency room was defined using a Kaplan-Meier 
survival function. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to develop 
adjusted risk estimates. Risk assessment began 24 hours after presentation and 
therefore the risk of stroke in the first few hours after TIA is not captured by 
our approach.
RESULTS: TIA was reported among 2,285 patients for an emergency room diagnosed, 
age-adjusted incidence of 68.2 per 100,000 population (95% CI 65.3 to 70.9). The 
risk of stroke after TIA was 9.5% (95% CI 8.3 to 10.7) at 90 days and 14.5% (95% 
CI 12.8 to 16.2) at 1 year. The risk of combined stroke, myocardial infarction, 
or death was 21.8% (95% CI 20.0 to 23.6) at 1 year. Hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, and older age predicted stroke at 1 year but not earlier.
CONCLUSIONS: Although stroke is common after TIA, the early risk is not 
predicted by clinical and demographic factors. Validated models to identify 
which patients require urgent intervention are needed.

Stroke in patients with cancer: incidence and etiology.

Cestari DM(1), Weine DM, Panageas KS, Segal AZ, DeAngelis LM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, Weill College of Medicine of Cornell University, New 
York, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and type of strokes in patients with cancer 
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
METHODS: Retrospective review of all ischemic strokes diagnosed by a neurologist 
and confirmed by neuroimaging between February 1997 and April 2001 was 
conducted. Age, gender, cancer diagnosis and stage, and vascular risk factors 
were recorded. NIH Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale scores were calculated 
retrospectively. Stroke etiology was assigned independently by two neurologists 
using the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria.
RESULTS: Ninety-six patients with a confirmed stroke were identified. The median 
age was 67, and 61.5% were men. The distribution of vascular risk factors was 
comparable with that seen in large stroke trials. Lung cancer (30%) was the most 
common primary tumor followed by brain and prostate cancer (9% each). Strokes 
were embolic in 52 (54%) and nonembolic in 44 (46%). Eleven of 12 tested 
patients had an elevated D-dimer level, but in only 3 patients could a 
definitive diagnosis of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis be made. The median 
survival was 4.5 months (95% CI 2.8 to 9.5) from the diagnosis of stroke; 25% of 
patients died within 30 days. Treatment had no effect on survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Embolic strokes are the commonest cause of stroke in patients with 
cancer, due partially to hypercoagulability, whereas atherosclerosis accounted 
for only 22% of stroke in this population. Outcome was primarily determined by 
the underlying malignancy and the patient's neurologic condition.

Clinica, Ospedale Universitario San Luigi, Orbassano, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) on the 
clinical efficacy of IFNbeta.
METHODS: This was an open-label study involving 78 patients with multiple 
sclerosis treated with Betaferon 8 million IU (MIU) subcutaneously (SC) every 
other day (n = 20), Rebif 22 micro g SC 3 times weekly (n = 25), or Avonex 30 
micro g IM once weekly (n = 33). Every 3 months, blood samples were collected 
and sera were analyzed for NAbs using an antiviral cytopathic effect assay. 
Patients were categorized according to their NAb status: NAb negative (NAb-); 
isolated NAb positive (NAb+), patients with > or =1 positive sample (titer > or 
= 20); and persistent NAb+, patients with > or =2 consecutive positive samples 
(titer > or = 20). Patients who were NAb- and persistent NAb+ were compared for 
relapse rate, time between first and second relapse, percentage of relapse-free 
patients, and percentage of patients who had a sustained progression of > or =1 
point on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).
RESULTS: The incidence of persistent NAb+ patients was 35% for Betaferon, 20% 
for Rebif, and 3% for Avonex. During IFNbeta treatment, both NAb+ and NAb- 
patients showed a reduction in relapse rate; this reduction (25%) was not 
significant in NAb+ patients but was significant (67%; p < 0.0001) in NAb- 
patients. In addition, the mean relapse rate was higher (p = 0.039), mean time 
between first and second relapse was shorter (13 vs 21 months; p = 0.0064), and 
there was a trend suggesting that NAbs affected the probability of remaining 
relapse free (p = 0.08). A higher percentage of NAb+ patients versus NAb- 
patients had worsening of EDSS scores during follow-up (p = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: Persistent NAbs significantly reduce the clinical efficacy of 
IFNbeta.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical and radiological long-term results of 
recanalization of chronic occluded iliac arteries with balloon angioplasty and 
stent placement.
METHODS: Sixty-nine occluded iliac arteries (mean length 8.1 cm; range 4-16 cm) 
in 67 patients were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent 
placement. Evaluations included clinical assessment according to Fontaine 
stages, Doppler examinations with ankle-brachial index (ABI) and bilateral lower 
extremity arteriograms. Wallstent and Cragg vascular stents were inserted for 
iliac artery recanalization under local anesthesia. Follow-up lasted 1-83 months 
(mean 29.5 months).
RESULTS: Technical success rate was 97.1% (67 of 69). The mean ABI increased 
from 0.46 to 0.85 within 30 days after treatment and was 0.83 at the most recent 
follow-up. Mean hospitalization time was 2 days and major complications included 
arterial thrombosis (3%), arterial rupture (3%) and distal embolization (1%). 
During follow-up 6% stenosis and 9% thrombosis of the stents were observed. 
Clinical improvement occurred in 92% of patients. Primary and secondary patency 
rates were 75% and 95%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The long-term patency rates and clinical benefits suggest that 
percutaneous endovascular revascularization with metallic stents is a safe and 
effective treatment for patients with chronic iliac artery occlusion.

Efficacy of complete resection for high-risk neuroblastoma: a Children's Cancer 
Group study.

Adkins ES, Sawin R, Gerbing RB, London WB, Matthay KK, Haase GM.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Previous reports indicate that complete resection of 
high-risk neuroblastoma improves outcome but may entail high surgical 
complication rates. The authors evaluated the effect of complete primary site 
resection on event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and complication 
rates in patients entered on a high-risk neuroblastoma treatment protocol.
METHODS: A total of 539 eligible patients with high-risk neuroblastoma were 
entered on protocol CCG-3891. Patients were assigned randomly to continuation 
chemotherapy or autologous bone marrow transplantation. Surgical resection was 
performed at diagnosis or after induction chemotherapy. Surgeons assessed 
resection as complete (CR), minimal residual (<5%, MR), or partial (PR). 
Incomplete resections received secondary resection or 10 Gy of external beam 
radiation. Patients were evaluated for EFS, OS, and complications of surgery 
based on completeness of overall best resection.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients resectable at diagnosis was 27% for CR and 
14% for MR. This improved after chemotherapy to 45% and 25%. Complication rates 
based on completeness of resection were 29%, 38%, and 36% for CR, MR, and PR, 
respectively. Estimated 5-year EFS rate was 30% +/- 3% for patients who achieved 
CR (n = 210) compared with 25% +/- 3% (P =.1010) for those with less than CR (n 
= 258).
CONCLUSIONS: Resectability improved after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Complete 
resection did not increase complications. There was a small survival benefit for 
complete resection. This study suggests that complete resection may still be 
important in the current era of intense chemotherapy and transplant.

Aging and aggregate costs of medical care: conceptual and policy issues.

The conventional wisdom says that because the cost of health care for the aged 
is more than that of the young at any time, there is a positive relationship 
between the aging or higher life expectancy of the population and aggregate 
health care spending. It is difficult, however, to find evidence to support this 
argument. We present a simple framework that shows how aging of the population 
may not necessarily increase the total cost of medical care over time or be 
observed across nations. This follows because numerous other factors that change 
with aging affect cost of care in ways that are not age-neutral. Such factors 
include age-specific shifts in morbidity and mortality, growth in income and 
insurance coverage, rising levels of education and changing technology. 
Consequently, the relative medical costs of the aged may indeed increase, at 
least for demographic reasons. Simultaneously, however, the costs of the young 
may decrease for the same reasons. The Israeli experience, used as a basis for a 
cursory empirical discussion of the issues, supports the line of reasoning 
presented in the paper.

Dog Registration data from three Cantons, patient data of 13 veterinary 
practices and registrations in the Swiss Dog Pedigree Book were collected, 
analysed and compared to results of a commercial household survey, to assess 
demographic characteristics of dog population in Switzerland. The proportion of 
"pure-bred" dogs was different depending on how the term was used, varying from 
24% regarding registrations in the Swiss Dog Pedigree Book, to 75% regarding 
dogs with only one breed recorded in Veterinarian's patient-history-management 
systems. Most popular breeds were dogs called "German Shepherd/Shepherd", 
followed by the Labrador and Golden Retriever. Comparison of different data 
sources suggested regional differences in popularity of breeds. The average life 
expectancy was estimated on 10.5 and 11 years. Sex distribution was equal. One 
third of all male dogs and half of the female dogs were neutered. Regardless 
sex, neutering was more common in cross-bred dogs than in "pure-bred" dogs (OR = 
1.9). Some bias in all sources had to be considered and there was a major 
concern regarding definition of breeds. However, the study was able to add 
different parameters out of different sources to a homogenous picture of 
demographic data of dog population in Switzerland.

Pediatric and adolescent obesity are a growing problem in New Jersey and 
throughout the United States. The long-term health consequences may produce a 
generation of children with a shorter life expectancy than their parents have. A 
coordinated effort by parents, teachers, physicians, public health 
organizations, schools, and peers is essential in encouraging children who are 
currently overweight to lose weight and attain a normal body mass index and to 
prevent other children from becoming overweight.

BACKGROUND: The population of dialysed patients includes an increasing 
percentage of very elderly patients. Although their life expectancy continues to 
increase, there are few currently available data about their quality of life.
OBJECTIVES: descriptive analysis of the determinants of quality of life, 
perceptual level of health and quality of life, and estimation of symptomatic 
complaints in a population of very elderly haemodialysed patients.
METHOD: Study of 35 haemodialysed patients aged 75 years old and older, who 
answered a questionnaire divided into 7 parts, defining: the determinants of 
their quality of life by open-ended questions, the prevalence of complaints 
amongst 35 pre-determined symptoms, Folstein MMSE performance, scores on Katz 
(ADL) and Lawton (IADL) independence scales, SF-36 perceptual health scale, and 
score subjectively allocated by the patients to their quality of life.
RESULTS: Maintenance of functional autonomy, independence in the decision-making 
process and maintaining good relationships with friends and family were major 
determinants of quality of life. Asthenia, the major complaint, was well 
reflected the reduced physical capabilities of the patients (mean SF-36 physical 
score: -1.1 SD). Despite the high prevalence of incapacitating painful symptoms 
(42%) and psychological symptoms (23%), autonomy remained satisfactory (mean ADL 
score: 5.6 out of 6 and IADL: 58%). The levels of perceptual health and of 
quality of life remained satisfactory for the majority of patients (mean mental 
SF-36 score: -0.06 SD, and 84% of the patients scored their quality of life > 5 
out of 10).
CONCLUSION: These figures indicate the considerable resources that these 
patients could mobilise. It also emerges as an additional argument against the 
exclusion, based only on the criteria of age and multiple pathologies, of the 
oldest patients from the access to dialysis.

The effect of depressive symptoms on survival in peritoneal dialysis patients.

Einwohner R(1), Bernardini J, Fried L, Piraino B.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: There is little information on the relationship between depressive 
symptoms and survival in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We examined whether 
a single measurement of depressive symptoms using a simple self-administered 
tool predicts survival.
DESIGN: Screening test of depressive symptoms as a predictor of outcome.
SETTING: Three dialysis centers in Southwestern Pennsylvania.
PARTICIPANTS: 66 adult PD subjects were screened in 1997-1998 for depression 
using the Zung scale.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline data collection included assessments of 
comorbidity, residual renal function, total Kt/V, nPNA, previous renal 
transplant, and serum albumin. Outcomes were collected prospectively after 
completion of the depression survey to 12/01. Cox regression analysis of patient 
survival was performed using all cofactors with p < 0.05 on univariate analysis.
RESULTS: One third of patients had depressive symptoms. Compared to nondepressed 
patients, depressive symptom patients were older (62.5 vs 52.5 years, p = 
0.012), had borderline lower serum albumin levels (3.47 vs 3.70 g/dL, p = 
0.058), and were more disabled (Karnofsky score 70 vs 90, p< 0.001), but had 
similar Kt/V, residual renal function, and previous time on PD at the point of 
the testing. Using multivariate analysis and controlling for comorbidity (using 
a measurement that includes diabetes mellitus and age) and serum albumin, the 
survival of patients with depressive symptoms was significantly reduced compared 
to nondepressed patients.
CONCLUSION: A single measurement of depressive symptoms using a simple 
self-administered test was an independent predictor of death in a cohort of PD 
patients, which extends observations in hemodialysis patients. Screening for 
depressive symptoms should be routine for dialysis patients, and those depressed 
should have thorough assessment and treatment. Whether treating depression will 
have an impact on survival is unclear and needs to be studied.

Survivorship and distribution of immature Anopheles gambiae s.l. (Diptera: 
Culicidae) in Banambani village, Mali.

California, Los Angeles 90095-1606, USA. fedillo@hsph.harvard.edu

We observed the survivorship and distribution of larvae and pupae of Anopheles 
gambiae s.l. Giles immature stages in three habitats (rock pools, swamp, and 
puddles) in Banambani village. Mali, West Africa, during the mid-rainy season of 
2000. Horizontal life tables were constructed for immatures in the laboratory. 
Times spent in the various immature stages were determined, and laboratory 
survival was measured. Vertical life tables were obtained from each habitat. We 
found large day-to-day variation for age class composition within habitats 
across days. The swamp samples had small but statistically significant different 
distributions in some instar stages compared with rock pools and puddles as 
affected by precipitation history. There were obviously unstable age 
distributions in the swamp and puddles and to some extent in rock pools. There 
were more individuals in some later age classes than in earlier ones. The daily 
survival estimates using an exponential decay model were 0.807 in rock pools, 
0.899 in the swamp, 0.818 in puddles, and 0.863 in the overall village. Possible 
reasons for the departure from stable age distribution were cannibalism, 
predation and other complex interactions, rainfall effects, sampling bias, and 
differences in physicochemical properties of the water in the habitats.

CONTEXT: Among men with early prostate cancer, the natural history without 
initial therapy determines the potential for survival benefit following radical 
local treatment. However, little is known about disease progression and 
mortality beyond 10 to 15 years of watchful waiting.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the long-term natural history of untreated, early stage 
prostatic cancer.
DESIGN: Population-based, cohort study with a mean observation period of 21 
years.
SETTING: Regionally well-defined catchment area in central Sweden (recruitment 
March 1977 through February 1984).
PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 223 patients (98% of all eligible) with 
early-stage (T0-T2 NX M0 classification), initially untreated prostatic cancer. 
Patients with tumor progression were hormonally treated (either by orchiectomy 
or estrogens) if they had symptoms.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Progression-free, cause-specific, and overall survival.
RESULTS: After complete follow-up, 39 (17%) of all patients experienced 
generalized disease. Most cancers had an indolent course during the first 10 to 
15 years. However, further follow-up from 15 (when 49 patients were still alive) 
to 20 years revealed a substantial decrease in cumulative progression-free 
survival (from 45.0% to 36.0%), survival without metastases (from 76.9% to 
51.2%), and prostate cancer-specific survival (from 78.7% to 54.4%). The 
prostate cancer mortality rate increased from 15 per 1000 person-years (95% 
confidence interval, 10-21) during the first 15 years to 44 per 1000 
person-years (95% confidence interval, 22-88) beyond 15 years of follow-up (P 
=.01).
CONCLUSION: Although most prostate cancers diagnosed at an early stage have an 
indolent course, local tumor progression and aggressive metastatic disease may 
develop in the long term. These findings would support early radical treatment, 
notably among patients with an estimated life expectancy exceeding 15 years.

Surveys carried out between 1990 and 2000 indicated that the incidence of STEC 
O157-associated gastroenteritis in The Netherlands was 1250 cases/year (median), 
of which 180 visited a general practitioner, 40 are reported and 0.6 are fatal, 
mainly in the elderly. There are approximately 20 cases of STEC O157-associated 
haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) per year, mainly in children. There are 2.5 
HUS patients per year who develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are an 
estimated 2 HUS-related and 0.5 ESRD-related fatalities per year. The mean 
disease burden associated with STEC O157 in the Dutch population is 116 (90% 
confidence interval 85-160) Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per year. 
Mortality due to HUS (58 DALYs), and ESRD (21 DALYs) and dialysis due to ESRD 
(21 DALYs) constitute the main determinants of disease burden. Sensitivity 
analysis indicates that uncertainty associated with model assumptions did not 
have a major effect on these estimates.

Bone loss in total knee arthroplasty: graft augment and options.

Cuckler JM(1).

Author information:
(1)Division of Orthopaedics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, 
Alabama 35294-3409, USA.

The alternatives available for management of bone defects in total knee 
arthroplasty include prosthetic augments, autograft, allograft, and the use of 
bone cement. The selection of the augment technique should be based on the 
defect size, the patient age and life expectancy, and an assessment of the 
documented clinical results of each method. Prosthetic augments will address the 
vast majority of defects. The use of allograft is primarily indicated in the 
setting of major bone loss in revision knee arthroplasty, whereas the use of 
autograft is appropriate in the management of small defects in primary 
arthroplasty. Bone cement can be used for small defects if the stability of the 
implant is not compromised by the defect.

BACKGROUND: The US immigrant population has grown considerably in the last three 
decades, from 9.6 million in 1970 to 32.5 million in 2002. However, this 
unprecedented population rise has not been accompanied by increased immigrant 
health monitoring. In this study, we examined the extent to which US- and 
foreign-born blacks, whites, Asians, and Hispanics differ in their health, life 
expectancy, and mortality patterns across the life course.
METHODS: We used National Vital Statistics System (1986-2000) and National 
Health Interview Survey (1992-1995) data to examine nativity differentials in 
health outcomes. Logistic regression and age-adjusted death rates were used to 
examine differentials.
RESULTS: Male and female immigrants had, respectively, 3.4 and 2.5 years longer 
life expectancy than the US-born. Compared to their US-born counterparts, black 
immigrant men and women had, respectively, 9.4 and 7.8 years longer life 
expectancy, but Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino immigrants had lower life 
expectancy. Most immigrant groups had lower risks of infant mortality and low 
birthweight than the US-born. Consistent with the acculturation hypothesis, 
immigrants' risks of disability and chronic disease morbidity increased with 
increasing length of residence. Cancer and other chronic disease mortality 
patterns for immigrants and natives varied considerably, with Asian Immigrants 
experiencing substantially higher stomach, liver and cervical cancer mortality 
than the US-born. Immigrants, however, had significantly lower mortality from 
lung, colorectal, breast, prostate and esophageal cancer, cardiovascular 
disease, cirrhosis, diabetes, respiratory diseases, HIV/AIDS, and suicide.
INTERPRETATION: Migration selectivity, social support, socio-economic, and 
behavioural characteristics may account for health differentials between 
immigrants and the US-born.

CONTEXTE: La population immigrante des √âtats-Unis a enregistr√© une croissance 
sans pr√©c√©dent au cours des trois derni√®res d√©cennies, passant de 9,6 millions 
de personnes en 1970 √† 32,5 millions en 2002. Cette hausse ne s‚Äôest toutefois 
pas accompagn√©e d‚Äôune surveillance accrue de la sant√© des immigrants. La 
pr√©sente √©tude examine la mesure dans laquelle les tendances en mati√®re de 
sant√©, d‚Äôesp√©rance de vie et de mortalit√© diff√®rent, au cours de la vie, chez 
les Noirs, les Blancs, les Asiatiques et les Hispaniques n√©s aux √âtats-Unis et √† 
l‚Äô√©tranger.
M√âTHODE: Gr√¢ce aux donn√©es du National Vital Statistics System (1986-2000) et de 
la National Health Interview Survey (1992‚Äì1995), nous avons examin√© les 
diff√©rences dans les r√©sultats sanitaires selon le lieu de naissance. Ces 
diff√©rences ont ensuite √©t√© analys√©es par r√©gression logistique et √† la lumi√®re 
des taux de mortalit√© rajust√©s selon l‚Äô√¢ge. R√©sultats: L‚Äôesp√©rance de vie des 
immigrants, hommes et femmes, √©tait plus longue de 3,4 et de 2,5 ans, 
respectivement, que celle de la population n√©e aux √âtats-Unis. Compar√©s √† leurs 
homologues n√©s aux √âtats-Unis, les immigrants noirs, hommes et femmes, avaient 
une esp√©rance de vie plus longue de 9,4 et de 7,8 ans, respectivement, mais 
l‚Äôesp√©rance de vie des immigrants chinois, japonais et philippins √©tait plus 
courte. Dans la plupart des groupes d‚Äôimmigrants, les risques de mortalit√© 
infantile et d‚Äôinsuffisance de poids √† la naissance √©taient plus faibles que 
dans la population n√©e aux √âtats-Unis. Conform√©ment √† l‚Äôhypoth√®se de 
l‚Äôacculturation, les risques d‚Äôincapacit√© et de maladies chroniques chez les 
immigrants augmentaient avec la dur√©e de leur √©tablissement aux √âtats-Unis. Les 
tendances de mortalit√© li√©e au cancer et √† d‚Äôautres maladies chroniques chez les 
immigrants et les Am√©ricains de naissance variaient consid√©rablement; par 
exemple, les taux de mortalit√© li√©s aux cancers de l‚Äôestomac, du foie et du col 
ut√©rin √©taient consid√©rablement plus √©lev√©s chez les immigrants asiatiques que 
dans la population n√©e aux √âtats- Unis. Toutefois, chez les immigrants, les taux 
de mortalit√© li√©s aux cancers du poumon, du c√¥lon et du rectum, du sein, de la 
prostate et de l‚Äôoesophage, aux maladies cardiovasculaires, √† la cirrhose, au 
diab√®te, aux maladies respiratoires, au VIH/sida et au suicide √©taient beaucoup 
plus faibles. Interpr√©tation: La s√©lection des immigrants, le soutien social et 
les caract√©ristiques socio√©conomiques et comportementales pourraient expliquer 
les diff√©rences de sant√© entre les immigrants et la population n√©e aux 
√âtats-Unis.

Autoantibody testing in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Dretzke J(1), Cummins C, Sandercock J, Fry-Smith A, Barrett T, Burls A.

Author information:

OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of autoantibody tests for autoimmune diseases 
in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Citation lists of 
included studies were scanned and relevant professional and patient websites 
reviewed. Laboratories and manufacturers were contacted to identify ongoing or 
unpublished research.
REVIEW METHODS: Following scoping searches on thyroid and coeliac 
autoantibodies, a systematic review of autoantibody tests for diagnosis of 
coeliac disease was carried out. Studies were included where cohorts of 
untreated patients with unknown disease status were included, all patients had 
undergone the reference test (biopsy) and antibody tests, and sensitivity and 
specificity were reported or calculable. Selected studies were then evaluated 
against a quality checklist. Summary statistics of diagnostic accuracy, i.e. 
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios and diagnostic 
odds ratios, were calculated for all studies. A decision analytic model was 
developed to evaluate the cost utility of screening for coeliac disease at 
diagnosis of diabetes.
RESULTS: All antibody tests for diagnosis of coeliac disease showed reasonably 
good diagnostic test accuracy. Studies reported variable measures of test 
accuracy, which may be due to aspects of study quality, differences in the tests 
and their execution in the laboratories, different populations and reference 
standards. The decision analytic model indicated screening for coeliac disease 
at diagnosis of diabetes was cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses exploring 
variations in the cost and disutility of gluten-free diet, the utilities 
attached to treated and untreated coeliac disease and the decrease in life 
expectancy associated with treated and untreated coeliac disease did 
substantially affect the cost-effectiveness of the screening strategies 
considered.
CONCLUSIONS: In terms of test accuracy in testing for coeliac disease, 
immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-endomysium is the most accurate test. If an 
enzyme-linked immunoassay test was required, which may be more suitable for 
screening purposes as it can be semi-automated, testing for IgA tissue 
transglutaminase is likely to be most accurate. The decision analytic model
