BACKGROUND: Glasgow, Scotland, has previously shown exceptional levels of 
violence among young men, shows aggregations of health conditions, with 
shortened life expectancy. Health conditions can be both causes and consequences 
of violence, of shared community-level socio-economic risk factors, and can 
result from large-scale social forces beyond the control of populations with 
high levels of violence. The aim of the study was to provide an in depth 
understanding of the Public Health problem of violence among young adult men in 
Glasgow East.
METHOD: Ecological investigation of violence and its associations with health 
conditions in areas of contrasting socioeconomic deprivation. National survey of 
1916 British men aged 18-34 years, augmented by a sub-sample of 765 men in 
Glasgow East (GE). Participants completed questionnaires covering current 
physical and sexual health, psychiatric symptoms, substance misuse, lifestyle, 
and crime and violence.
RESULTS: The 5-year prevalence of violence was similar in both surveys but 
fights involving weapons (AOR 3.32, 95% CI 2.29-4.79), gang fights (AOR 2.30, 
95% CI 1.77-2.98), and instrumental violence supporting criminal lifestyles were 
more common in GE, where 1 in 9 men had been in prison. Violent men in both 
samples reported poorer physical and sexual health and all types of psychiatric 
morbidity except depression, with multiple high-risk behaviours for both future 
poor health and violence. Associations between drug and alcohol dependence and 
violence in GE could not be entirely explained by deprivation.
CONCLUSION: Violence in deprived urban areas is one among many high-risk 
behaviours and lifestyle factors leading to, as well as resulting from, 
aggregations of both psychiatric and physical health conditions. Poverty partly 
explained raised levels of violence in GE. Other factors such as drug and 
alcohol misuse and macho attitudes to violence, highly prevalent among men in 
this socially excluded community, also contributed. Multi-component preventive 
interventions may be needed in deprived areas and require future investigations 
into how multiple co-existing risk factors produce multimorbidity, including 
psychiatric disorders, substance misuse, poor physical health and violence.

BACKGROUND: The health impacts of ambient air pollution impose large costs on 
society. Although all people are exposed to air pollution, the older population 
(ie, those aged ≥60 years) tends to be disproportionally affected. As a result, 
there is growing concern about the health impacts of air pollution as many 
countries undergo rapid population ageing. We investigated the spatial and 
temporal variation in the economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient air 
pollution and its interaction with population ageing from 2000 to 2016 at global 
and regional levels.
METHODS: In this global analysis, we developed an age-adjusted measure of the 
value of a statistical life-year (VSLY) to estimate the economic cost of deaths 
attributable to ambient PM2·5 pollution using Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 data and country-level socioeconomic 
information. First, we estimated the global age-specific and cause-specific 
mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) attributable to PM2·5 pollution using 
the global exposure mortality model and global estimates of exposure at 
0·1° × 0·1° (about 11 km × 11 km at the equator) resolution. Second, for each 
year between 2000 and 2016, we translated the YLLs within each age group into a 
health-related cost using a country-specific, age-adjusted measure of VSLY. 
Third, we decomposed the major driving factors that contributed to the temporal 
change in health costs related to PM2·5. Finally, we did a sensitivity test to 
analyse the variability of the estimated health costs to four alternative 
valuation measures. We identified the uncertainty intervals (UIs) from 1000 
draws of the parameters and concentration-response functions by age, cause, 
country, and year. All economic values are reported in 2011 purchasing power 
parity-adjusted US dollars. All simulations were done with R, version 3.6.0.
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2016, PM2·5 was estimated to have caused 8·42 million 
(95% UI 6·50-10·52) attributable deaths, which was associated with 163·68 
million (116·03-219·44) YLLs. In 2016, the global economic cost of deaths 
attributable to ambient PM2·5 pollution for the older population was US$2·40 
trillion (1·89-2·93) accounting for 59% (59-60) of the cost for the total 
population ($4·09 trillion [3·19-5·05]). The economic cost per capita for the 
older population was $2739 (2160-3345) in 2016, which was 10 times that of the 
younger population (ie, those aged <60 years). By assessing the factors that 
contributed to economic costs, we found that increases in these factors changed 
the total economic cost by 77% for gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, 21% 
for population ageing, 16% for population growth, -41% for age-specific 
mortality, and -0·4% for PM2·5 exposure.
INTERPRETATION: The economic cost of ambient PM2·5 borne by the older population 
almost doubled between 2000 and 2016, driven primarily by GDP growth, population 
ageing, and population growth. Compared with younger people, air pollution leads 
to disproportionately higher health costs among older people, even after 
accounting for their relatively shorter life expectancy and increased 
disability. As the world's population is ageing, the disproportionate health 
cost attributable to ambient PM2·5 pollution potentially widens the health 
inequities for older people. Countries with severe air pollution and rapid 
ageing rates need to take immediate actions to improve air quality. In addition, 
strategies aimed at enhancing health-care services, especially targeting the 
older population, could be beneficial for reducing the health costs of ambient 
air pollution.

OBJECTIVES: Onasemnogene Abeparvovec-xioi (AVXS-101) is a gene therapy intended 
for curative treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with an expected price 
of around €2 000 000. The goal of this study is to perform a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of treatment of SMA I patients with AVXS-101 in The Netherlands 
including relapse scenarios.
METHODS: An individual-based state-transition model was used to model treatment 
effect and survival of SMA I patients treated with AVXS-101, nusinersen and best 
supportive care (BSC). The model included five health states: three health 
states according to SMA types, one for permanent ventilation and one for death. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Effects of 
relapsing to lower health states in the years following treatment was explored.
RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for AVXS-101 
versus BSC is €138 875/QALY, and €53 447/QALY for AVXS-101 versus nusinersen. If 
patients relapse within 10 years after treatment with AVXS-101, the ICER can 
increase up to 6-fold, with effects diminishing thereafter. Only relapses 
occurring later than 50 years after treatment have a negligible effect on the 
ICER. To comply with Dutch willingness-to-pay reference values, the price of 
AVXS-101 must decrease to €680 000.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, treatment with AVXS-101 is unlikely to be 
cost-effective under Dutch willingness-to-pay reference values. Uncertainty 
regarding the long-term curative properties of AVXS-101 can result in 
multiplication of the ICER. Decision-makers are advised to appropriately balance 
these uncertainties against the price they are willing to pay now.

OBJECTIVES: Smoking is a leading cause of death worldwide. Cessation aids 
include varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and 
e-cigarettes at various doses (low, standard and high) and used alone or in 
combination with each other. Previous cost-effectiveness analyses have not fully 
accounted for adverse effects nor compared all cessation aids. The objective was 
to determine the relative cost-effectiveness of cessation aids in the United 
Kingdom.
METHODS: An established Markov cohort model was adapted to incorporate health 
outcomes and costs due to depression and self-harm associated with cessation 
aids, alongside other health events. Relative efficacy in terms of abstinence 
and major adverse neuropsychiatric events was informed by a systematic review 
and network meta-analysis. Base case results are reported for UK-licensed 
interventions only. Two sensitivity analyses are reported, one including 
unlicensed interventions and another comparing all cessation aids but removing 
the impact of depression and self-harm. The sensitivity of conclusions to model 
inputs was assessed by calculating the expected value of partial perfect 
information.
RESULTS: When limited to UK-licensed interventions, varenicline standard-dose 
and NRT standard-dose were most cost-effective. Including unlicensed 
interventions, e-cigarette low-dose appeared most cost-effective followed by 
varenicline standard-dose + bupropion standard-dose combined. When the impact of 
depression and self-harm was excluded, varenicline standard-dose + NRT 
standard-dose was most cost-effective, followed by varenicline low-dose + NRT 
standard-dose.
CONCLUSION: Although found to be most cost-effective, combined therapy is 
currently unlicensed in the United Kingdom and the safety of e-cigarettes 
remains uncertain. The value-of-information analysis suggested researchers 
should continue to investigate the long-term effectiveness and safety outcomes 
of e-cigarettes in studies with active comparators.

OBJECTIVES: The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is an 
independent organization that reviews drugs and devices with a focus on emerging 
agents. As part of their evaluation, ICER estimates value-based prices (VBP) at 
$50 000 to $150 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained thresholds. We 
compared actual estimated net prices to ICER-estimated VBPs.
METHODS: We reviewed ICER final evidence reports from November 2007 to October 
2020. List prices were combined with average discounts obtained from SSR Health 
to estimate net prices. If a drug had been evaluated more than once for the same 
indication, only the more recent VBP was included.
RESULTS: A total of 34 ICER reports provided unique VBPs for 102 drugs. The net 
price of 81% of drugs exceeded the $100 000 per QALY VBP and 71% exceeded the 
$150 000 per QALY VBP. The median change in net price needed to reach the $150 
000 per QALY VBP was a 36% reduction. The median decrease in net price needed 
was highest for drugs targeting rare inherited disorders (n = 15; 62%) and 
lowest for cardiometabolic disorders (n = 6; 162% price increase). The reduction 
in net prices needed to reach ICER-estimated VBPs was higher for drugs evaluated 
for the first approved indication, rare diseases, less competitive markets, and 
if the drug approval occurred before the ICER report became available.
CONCLUSION: Net prices are often above VBPs estimated by ICER. Although gaining 
awareness among decision makers, the long-term impact of ICER evaluations on 
pricing and access to new drugs continues to evolve.

Health technology assessment agencies often prefer that utilities used to 
calculate quality-adjusted life years in cost-utility analyses (CUAs) are 
derived using standardized methods, such as generic preference-based measures 
completed by patients in clinical trials. However, there are situations when no 
standardized approach is feasible or appropriate for a specific medical 
condition or treatment that must be represented in a CUA. When this occurs, 
vignette-based methods are often used to estimate utilities. A vignette 
(sometimes called a "scenario," "health state description," "health state 
vignette," or "health state") is a description of a health state that is valued 
in a preference elicitation task to obtain a utility estimate. This method is 
sometimes the only feasible way to estimate utilities representing a concept 
that is important for a CUA. Consequently, vignette-based studies continue to be 
conducted and published, with the resulting utilities used in economic models to 
inform decision making about healthcare resource allocation. Despite the 
potential impact of vignette-based utilities on medical decision making, there 
is no published guidance or review of this methodology. This article provides 
recommendations for researchers, health technology assessment reviewers, and 
policymakers who may be deciding whether to use vignette-based methods, 
designing a vignette study, using vignette-based utilities in a CUA, or 
evaluating a CUA that includes vignette-based utilities. Recommendations are 
provided on: (A) when to use vignette-based utilities, (B) methods for 
developing vignettes, (C) valuing vignettes, (D) use of vignette-based utilities 
in models, and (E) limitations of vignette methods.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate alternative methods to calculate and/or attribute 
economic surplus in the cost-effectiveness analysis of single or short-term 
therapies.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of articles describing 
alternative methods for cost-effectiveness analysis of potentially curative 
therapies whose assessment using traditional methods may suggest unaffordable 
valuations owing to the magnitude of estimated long-term quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gains or cost offsets. Through internal deliberation and 
discussion with staff at the Health Technology Assessment bodies in England and 
Canada, we developed the following 3 alternative methods for further evaluation: 
(1) capping annual costs in the comparator arm at $150 000 per year; (2) 
"sharing" the economic surplus with the health sector by apportioning only 50% 
of cost offsets or 50% of cost offsets and QALY gains to the value of the 
therapy; and (3) crediting the therapy with only 12 years of the average annual 
cost offsets or cost offsets and QALY gains over the lifetime horizon. The 
impact of each alternative method was evaluated by applying it in an economic 
model of 3 hypothetical condition-treatment scenarios meant to reflect a 
diversity of chronicity and background healthcare costs.
RESULTS: The alternative with greatest impact on threshold price for the fatal 
pediatric condition spinal muscular atrophy type 1 was the 12-year cutoff 
scenario. For a hypothetical one-time treatment for hemophilia A, capping cost 
offsets at $150 000 per year had the greatest impact. For chimeric antigen 
receptor T-cell treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, capping cost offsets or 
using 12-year threshold had little impact, whereas 50% sharing of surplus 
including QALY gains and cost offsets greatly reduced threshold pricing.
CONCLUSIONS: Health Technology Assessment bodies and policy makers will wrestle 
with how to evaluate single or short-term potentially curative therapies and 
establish pricing and payment mechanisms to ensure sustainability. Scenario 
analyses using alternative methods for calculating and apportioning economic 
surplus can provide starkly different assessment results. These methods may 
stimulate important societal dialogue on fair pricing for these novel 
treatments.

OBJECTIVES: To develop a cancer-specific multi-attribute utility instrument 
derived from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) 
health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaire.
METHODS: We derived a descriptive system based on a subset of the 27-item 
FACT-G. Item selection was informed by psychometric analyses of existing FACT-G 
data (n = 6912) and by patient input (n = 82). We then conducted an online 
valuation survey, with participants recruited via an Australian general 
population online panel. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used, with 
attributes being the HRQL dimensions of the descriptive system and survival 
duration, and 16 choice-pairs per participant. Utility decrements were estimated 
with conditional logit and mixed logit modeling.
RESULTS: Eight HRQL dimensions were included in the descriptive system: pain, 
fatigue, nausea, sleep, work, social support, sadness, and future health worry; 
each with 5 levels. Of 1737 panel members who accessed the valuation survey, 
1644 (95%) completed 1 or more DCE choice-pairs and were included in analyses. 
Utility decrements were generally monotonic; within each dimension, poorer HRQL 
levels generally had larger utility decrements. The largest utility decrements 
were for the highest levels of pain (-0.40) and nausea (-0.28). The worst health 
state had a utility of -0.54, considerably worse than dead.
CONCLUSIONS: A descriptive system and preference-based scoring approach were 
developed for the FACT-8D, a new cancer-specific multi-attribute utility 
instrument derived from the FACT-G. The Australian value set is the first of a 
series of country-specific value sets planned that can facilitate cost-utility 
analyses based on items from the FACT-G and related FACIT questionnaires 
containing FACT-G items.

Phase 3 randomized-controlled trials have provided promising results of COVID-19 
vaccine efficacy, ranging from 50 to 95% against symptomatic disease as the 
primary endpoints, resulting in emergency use authorization/listing for several 
vaccines. However, given the short duration of follow-up during the clinical 
trials, strict eligibility criteria, emerging variants of concern, and the 
changing epidemiology of the pandemic, many questions still remain unanswered 
regarding vaccine performance. Post-introduction vaccine effectiveness 
evaluations can help us to understand the vaccine's effect on reducing infection 
and disease when used in real-world conditions. They can also address important 
questions that were either not studied or were incompletely studied in the 
trials and that will inform evolving vaccine policy, including assessment of the 
duration of effectiveness; effectiveness in key subpopulations, such as the very 
old or immunocompromised; against severe disease and death due to COVID-19; 
against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern; and with different vaccination 
schedules, such as number of doses and varying dosing intervals. WHO convened an 
expert panel to develop interim best practice guidance for COVID-19 vaccine 
effectiveness evaluations. We present a summary of the interim guidance, 
including discussion of different study designs, priority outcomes to evaluate, 
potential biases, existing surveillance platforms that can be used, and 
recommendations for reporting results.

BACKGROUND: Global burden of COVID-19 has not been well studied, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and value of statistical life (VSL) 
metrics were therefore proposed to quantify its impacts on health and economic 
loss globally.
METHODS: The life expectancy, cases, and death numbers of COVID-19 until 30th 
April 2021 were retrieved from open data to derive the epidemiological profiles 
and DALYs (including years of life lost (YLL) and years loss due to disability 
(YLD)) by four periods. The VSL estimates were estimated by using hedonic wage 
method (HWM) and contingent valuation method (CVM). The estimate of willingness 
to pay using CVM was based on the meta-regression mixed model. Machine learning 
method was used for classification.
RESULTS: Globally, DALYs (in thousands) due to COVID-19 was tallied as 31,930 
from Period I to IV. YLL dominated over YLD. The estimates of VSL were US$591 
billion and US$5135 billion based on HWM and CVM, respectively. The estimate of 
VSL increased from US$579 billion in Period I to US$2160 billion in Period IV 
using CVM. The higher the human development index (HDI), the higher the value of 
DALYs and VSL. However, there exits the disparity even at the same level of HDI. 
Machine learning analysis categorized eight patterns of global burden of 
COVID-19 with a large variation from US$0.001 billion to US$691.4 billion.
CONCLUSION: Global burden of COVID-19 pandemic resulted in substantial health 
and value of life loss particularly in developed economies. Classifications of 
such health and economic loss is informative to early preparation of adequate 
resource to reduce impacts.

INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has been associated not 
only with respiratory complications. The COVID-19 disease includes, also damage 
to other organ systems as well as coagulopathy. The present report describes a 
case of COVID-19 presenting with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and subsequent 
acute limb ischemia (ALI).
PRESENTATION OF CASE: An 84-years old hospitalized female patient presenting 
diabetes and recent COVID-19 reported acute onset of abdominal pain and typical 
findings of AMI. The CT-angiography confirmed the AMI secondary to a superior 
mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion. The patient was managed through an 
endovascular approach using a SMA mechanical thrombectomy and stenting with a 
good result.
DISCUSSION: Treatment of this life-threatening condition includes surgical 
resection of the necrotic bowel, restoration of blood flow to the ischemic 
intestine and supportive measure - gastrointestinal decompression, fluid 
resuscitation, hemodynamic support. Endovascular management of AMI is preferred 
over the standard surgical approach due to a reduced mortality and morbidity 
rates. Imaging findings of intestinal necrosis, however, represent an indication 
for AMI surgical treatment with explorative laparotomy. Different endovascular 
solutions have been employed to address AMI including mechanical thrombectomy, 
local thrombolysis, and PTA-stenting.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 clinical presentation can be atypical, including 
gastrointestinal symptoms. If a first embolic event occurs, an aggressive 
anticoagulation treatment could be inefficient to reduce the risk of subsequent 
embolization events. The limited life expectancy of such revascularization 
procedures should orientate towards less invasive treatments.

BACKGROUND: older people with cancer are at risk of complex and fluctuating 
health problems, but little is known about the extent to which their well-being 
changes in the last years of life.
OBJECTIVE: to examine changes in physical, psychological and social well-being 
in the last 5 years of life of older people with cancer.
DESIGN: prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Belgium, the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: people with a new primary diagnosis of breast, prostate, lung or 
gastrointestinal cancer, aged ≥70 years, life expectancy >6 months, were 
recruited from nine hospitals. We analysed data of deceased patients.
METHODS: data were collected from participants around diagnosis, and after 
6 months, 1, 3 and 5 years through structured questionnaires administered 
through interviews or as self-report. Outcomes were physical, emotional, social, 
role functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30), depressive symptoms (GDS-15), emotional and 
social loneliness (Loneliness Scale). We conducted linear mixed model analyses.
RESULTS: analysing 225 assessments from 107 deceased participants (assessments 
took place between 1,813 and 5 days before death), mean age at baseline 77 years 
(standard deviation: 5.2), we found statistically significant deterioration in 
physical functioning (b = 0,016 [95%confidence interval 0.009-0.023]), 
depressive symptoms (b = -0,001 [-0.002 to 0.000]) and role functioning 
(b = 0.014 [0.004-0.024]). Changes over time in emotional and social functioning 
and in social and emotional loneliness were smaller and statistically 
non-significant.
CONCLUSIONS: care towards the end of life for older people with cancer needs to 
put their social and psychological well-being at the centre, alongside physical 
needs. Future research should focus on understanding inter-individual variation 
in trajectories.

BACKGROUND: increasing numbers of older people are undergoing vascular surgery. 
Preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimisation (CGA) reduces 
postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. Establishing CGA-based 
perioperative services requires health economic evaluation prior to 
implementation. Through a modelling-based economic evaluation, using data from a 
single site clinical trial, this study evaluates whether CGA is a cost-effective 
alternative to standard preoperative assessment for older patients undergoing 
elective arterial surgery.
METHODS: an economic evaluation, using decision-analytic modelling, comparing 
preoperative CGA and optimisation with standard preoperative care, was 
undertaken in older patients undergoing elective arterial surgery. The 
incremental net health benefit of CGA, expressed in terms of quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: CGA is a cost-effective substitute for standard preoperative care in 
elective arterial surgery across a range of cost-effectiveness threshold values. 
An incremental net benefit of 0.58 QALYs at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
£30k, 0.60 QALYs at a threshold of £20k and 0.63 QALYs at a threshold of £13k 
was observed. Mean total pre- and postoperative health care utilisation costs 
were estimated to be £1,165 lower for CGA patients largely accounted for by 
reduced postoperative bed day utilisation.
CONCLUSION: this study demonstrates a likely health economic benefit in addition 
to the previously described clinical benefit of employing CGA methodology in the 
preoperative setting in older patients undergoing arterial surgery. Further 
evaluation should examine whether CGA-based perioperative services can be 
effectively implemented and achieve the same clinical and health economic 
outcomes at scale.

Effects of Hip Flexion on Knee Extension and Flexion Isokinetic Angle-Specific 
Torques and HQ-Ratios.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: During isokinetic knee strength testing, the knee 
flexion angles that correspond to the measured torque values are rarely 
considered. Additionally, the hip flexion angle during seated testing diverges 
from that in the majority of daily life and sporting activities. Limited 
information concerning the influence of hip angle, muscle contraction mode, and 
velocity on the isokinetic knee strength over the entire range of motion (ROM) 
is available. Twenty recreational athletes (10 females, 10 males; 23.3 ± 3.2 
years; 72.1 ± 16.5 kg; 1.78 ± 0.07 m) were tested for isokinetic knee flexion 
and extension at 10° and 90° hip flexion with the following conditions: (i) 
concentric at 60°/s, (ii) concentric at 180°/s, and (iii) eccentric at 60°/s. 
The effects of hip angle, contraction mode, and velocity on angle-specific 
torques and HQ-ratios as well as conventional parameters (peak torques, angles 
at peak torque, and HQ-ratios) were analyzed using statistical parametric 
mapping and parametric ANOVAs, respectively.
RESULTS: Generally, the angle-specific and conventional torques and HQ-ratios 
were lower in the extended hip compared to a flexed hip joint. Thereby, in 
comparison to the knee extension, the torque values decreased to a greater 
extent during knee flexion but not consistent over the entire ROM. The torque 
values were greater at the lower velocity and eccentric mode, but the influence 
of the velocity and contraction mode were lower at shorter and greater muscle 
lengths, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Isokinetic knee strength is influenced by the hip flexion angle. 
Therefore, a seated position during testing and training is questionable, 
because the hip joint is rarely flexed at 90° during daily life and sporting 
activities. Maximum knee strength is lower in supine position, which should be 
considered for training and testing. The angle-specific effects cannot be 
mirrored by the conventional parameters. Therefore, angle-specific analyses are 
recommended to obtain supplemental information and consequently to improve knee 
strength testing.

BACKGROUND: With the increase in life expectancy, a large number of patients 
with osteoporosis (OP) are undergoing spine surgery, which may adversely affect 
the surgical success rate. The prevalence of OP varies in different regions, and 
no data are available that represent the prevalence of OP among Chinese patients 
over 50 years of age who are undergoing spine surgery. It was the first 
multicenter study to assess OP in these patients. Aiming to obtain comprehensive 
data, this study combined bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and visual 
radiography assessment (VRA) to analyze the prevalence of OP in patients 
aged > 50 years who underwent spine surgery.
METHODS: Data from 1,856 patients aged over 50 years undergoing spine surgery 
who resided in northern, central, and southern China were reviewed between 2018 
and 2019. Based on the perioperative BMD and X-ray data, we calculated the 
prevalence of OP in this special population according to sex, age, and spine 
degenerative disease.
RESULTS: A total of 1,245 patients (678 females and 567 males) were included in 
the study. The prevalence of OP diagnosed by BMD was 52.8 % in females and 
18.7 % in males. When we combined with BMD and VRA, the prevalence of OP 
increased from 52.8 to 65.9 % in females and from 18.7 to 40.6 % in males. 
Although OP was more severe in females than in males, a significant difference 
in the rate of vertebral fracture (VF) was not observed between females and 
males with a normal BMD and osteopenia (females vs. males: aged 50-59 years, 
P = 0.977; 60-69 years, P = 0.302; >70 years, P = 0.172). Similarly, no 
significant difference in the vertebral fracture rate was observed within 
different age groups of patients with a normal BMD and osteopenia (females: 
P = 0.210; males, P = 0.895). The incidence of OP in patients with degenerative 
scoliosis was higher than that in the remaining patients (females: 63.6 % vs. 
42.4 %, P = 0.018; males: 38.9 % vs. 13.8 %, P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of OP was identified in patients aged > 50 years 
undergoing spine surgery, especially in patients whose primary diagnosis was 
degenerative scoliosis. BMD and VRA evaluations should be included in the 
clinical routine for these patients prior to surgery.

MDCT evaluation of synchronous breast carcinoma and other solid malignancies.

El-Badrawy A(1).

Author information:
(1)Radiology Department, Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, 
Dakahlya, Egypt.

BACKGROUND: Multiple primary malignancies are two or more malignancies in an 
individual without any relationship between the tumors. The development of 
improved diagnostic techniques, increased survival of cancer patients and the 
growing life expectancy have all contributed to the increased frequency of this 
phenomenon.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to review the multidetector computed 
tomography (MDCT) findings of synchronous breast carcinoma and other solid 
malignancies.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 65 patients confirmed with diagnosis 
of synchronous breast carcinoma and other solid malignancies. CT scanning was 
performed using 128 MDCT in all patients. All one hundred-thirty malignancies 
underwent pathological evaluation.
RESULTS: Out of 4120 patients with breast carcinoma; 65 patients were diagnosed 
with other synchronous primary solid malignancy. All one hundred-thirty 
malignancies were confirmed pathologically. Breast carcinoma detected in all 65 
patients; of them metastatic breast carcinoma detected in 8 patients. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma was detected in 18 patients, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) 
in 12 patients, endometrial carcinoma in 8 patients, uterine sarcoma in 3 
patients, malignant mixed Müllerian tumor in one patient, ovarian carcinoma in 5 
patients, renal cell carcinoma in 4 patients, thyroid carcinoma in 4 patients, 
gastric carcinoma in 2 patients, colonic carcinoma in 2 patients, ano-rectal 
carcinoma in one patient, hilar cholangiocarcinoma in 2 patients, malignant 
melanoma in 2 patients and bronchogenic carcinoma in one patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with breast carcinoma have a risk of other synchronous 
primary malignancy. So, careful preoperative examination is recommended to 
improve the patients' prognosis. MDCT scanning is accurately imaging modality 
for evaluation of synchronous breast carcinoma and other solid malignancies. The 
aim of treatment in cancer patients should always be curative even in the 
presence of multiple malignancies.
