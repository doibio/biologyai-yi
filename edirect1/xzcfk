(n=333), deaths of civilian male children (n=11 730) were caused more often by 
air bombardments (39·2% vs 5·4%, p<0·0001) and shelling (37·3% vs 13·2%, 
p<0·0001) and less often by shooting (12·5% vs 76·0%, p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: Aerial bombing and shelling rapidly became primary causes of 
direct deaths of women and children and had disproportionate lethal effects on 
civilians, calling into question the use of wide-area explosive weapons in urban 
areas. Increased reliance on aerial bombing by the Syrian Government and 
international partners is likely to have contributed to findings that children 
were killed in increasing proportions over time, ultimately comprising a quarter 
of civilian deaths in 2016. The inordinate proportion of civilians among the 
executed is consistent with deliberate tactics to terrorise civilians. Deaths 
from barrel bombs were overwhelmingly civilian rather than opposition 
combatants, suggesting indiscriminate or targeted warfare contrary to 
international humanitarian law and possibly constituting a war crime.
FUNDING: None.

In series of pharmacometrics research by determination of an optimum model of 
dosing is established that introduction of OKAGERM-4 in a dose of 96.8 mg/kg 
administered 40 minutes before the start of hypoxic damage realizes in maximum 
increase of estimated life expectancy of animals in hermetically sealed 
containers (65.57 min), ensuring a maximum effect of potential 
pharmacotherapeutic remedy - tartaric acid-based coordination compound of 
germanium with manganese. Thus, the results of pharmacometric research aimed to 
develop dosing regimen of OKAGERM-4 may be the base for future episodes of its 
pre-clinical study.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: After the publication of the interim analysis of the ART, we 
review the contradiction between the large numbers of observational studies 
published on the course of over 25 years and the randomized trials comparing the 
use of single versus multiple arterial grafts for coronary bypass surgery.
RECENT FINDINGS: The Arterial Revascularization Trial (ART) found no difference 
in survival and event-free survival at 5 years between patients randomized to 
receive one or two internal thoracic arteries at the time of surgery.
SUMMARY: At the moment, there is evidence that arterial grafts have higher 
patency rate than venous grafts and a possible protective effect on the coronary 
circulation. Arterial grafts are still a reasonable choice, especially in 
patients with long life expectancy. Further studies and the final results of ART 
are needed.

BACKGROUND: Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries have lower life 
expectancies and higher alcohol-attributable mortality than Western European 
countries. We examine the contribution of alcohol consumption to mortality 
across Europe, and specifically to the East-West life expectancy gap from 1990 
onward.
METHODS: We retrieved alcohol-attributable mortality rates (GBD Study 2013) and 
all-cause mortality rates (Human Mortality Database) by age and sex for nine CEE 
countries and for the EU-15 countries. We assessed country-specific potential 
gains in life expectancy (PGLE) by eliminating alcohol-attributable mortality 
using associated single decrement life tables. We decomposed the life expectancy 
differences between each CEE country and the EU-15 population-weighted average 
for 1990-2012/13 into alcohol-attributable and non-alcohol-attributable 
mortality.
RESULTS: In 2012/13, the PGLE for men and women were, respectively, 2.15 and 
1.00 years in the CEE region and 0.90 and 0.44 years in the EU-15 region. The 
contribution of alcohol to the East-West gap in life expectancy was largest 
among men in Russia {2.88 years [uncertainty interval (UI): 1.57-4.06]}, Belarus 
[3.70 years (UI: 1.75-5.45)] and Ukraine [2.47 years (UI: 0.90-3.88)]. The 
relative contributions increased in most of the countries between 1990 and 2005 
(on average, from 17.0% to 25.4% for men, and from 14.7% to 22.5% for women), 
and declined thereafter (20.2% for men and 20.5% for women in 2012/13).
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol contributed substantially to the East-West life expectancy 
gap in Europe, and to its increase (1990-2005) and decline (2005 onward). 
Diminishing alcohol consumption in CEE countries to Western European levels can 
contribute to mortality convergence across Europe.

Accurate epidemiological surveillance of the burden of stroke is direly needed 
to facilitate the development and evaluation of effective interventions in 
Africa. The authors therefore conducted a systematic review of the methodology 
of stroke epidemiological studies conducted in Africa from 1970 to 2017 using 
gold standard criteria obtained from landmark epidemiological publications. Of 
1330 articles extracted, only 50 articles were eligible for review grouped under 
incidence, prevalence, case-fatality, health-related quality of life, and 
disability-adjusted life-years studies. Because of various challenges, no study 
fulfilled the criteria for an excellent stroke incidence study. The relatively 
few stroke epidemiology studies in Africa have significant methodological flaws. 
Innovative approaches leveraging available information and communication 
technology infrastructure are recommended to facilitate rigorous epidemiological 
studies for accurate stroke surveillance in Africa.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Internet-based 
cognitive-behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa (CBT-BN) compared to 
face-to-face delivery of CBT-BN.
METHODS: This study is a planned secondary analysis of data from a randomized 
clinical trial. Participants were 179 adults (98% female, mean age = 28 years) 
meeting DSM-IV criteria for bulimia nervosa who were randomized to group 
face-to-face or group Internet-based CBT-BN for 16 sessions during 20 weeks. The 
cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a third-party payor perspective, 
and a partial societal perspective analysis was conducted to investigate 
cost-utility (ie, cost per gain in quality-adjusted life-years) and patient 
out-of-pocket travel-related costs. Net health care costs were calculated from 
protocol and nonprotocol health care services using third-party payor cost 
estimates. The primary outcome measure in the clinical trial was abstinence from 
binge eating and purging, and the trial start and end dates were 2008 and 2016.
RESULTS: The mean cost per abstinent patient at posttreatment was $7,757 (95% 
confidence limit [CL], $4,515, $13,361) for face-to-face and $11,870 (95% CL, 
$6,486, $22,188) for Internet-based CBT-BN, and at 1-year follow-up was $16,777 
(95% CL, $10,298, $27,042) for face-to-face and $14,561 (95% CL, $10,165, 
$21,028) for Internet-based CBT-BN. There were no statistically significant 
differences between treatment arms in cost-effectiveness or cost-utility at 
posttreatment or 1-year follow-up. Out-of-pocket patient costs were 
significantly higher for face-to-face (mean [95% CL] = $178 [$127, $140]) than 
Internet-based ($50 [$50, $50]) therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Third-party payor cost-effectiveness of Internet-based CBT-BN is 
comparable with that of an accepted standard. Internet-based dissemination of 
CBT-BN may be a viable alternative for patients geographically distant from 
specialist eating disorder services who have an unmet need for treatment.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive and lethal primary brain 
tumor, is characterized by very low life expectancy. Understanding the genomic 
and proteogenomic characteristics of GBM is essential for devising better 
therapeutic approaches.Here, we performed proteomic profiling of 8 GBM and 
paired normal brain tissues. In parallel, comprehensive integrative genomic 
analysis of GBM was performed in silico using mRNA microarray and sequencing 
data. Two whole transcript expression profiling cohorts were used - a set of 3 
normal brain tissues and 22 glioma tissue samples and a cohort of 5 normal brain 
tissues and 49 glioma tissue samples. A validation cohort included 529 GBM 
patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. We identified 36 molecules 
commonly changed at the level of the gene and protein, including up-regulated 
TGFBI and NES and down-regulated SNCA and HSPA12A. Single amino acid variant 
analysis identified 200 proteins with high mutation rates in GBM samples. We 
further identified 14 differentially expressed genes with high-level protein 
modification, among which NES and TNC showed differential expression at the 
protein level. Moreover, higher expression of NES and TNC mRNAs correlated with 
shorter overall survival, suggesting that these genes constitute potential 
biomarkers for GBM.

Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is a rare subcategory of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (WHO Group 1). The disease is poorly understood and difficult to 
diagnose; it has no definitive cure to date. These patients present with 
nonspecific symptoms, including dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and weakness. 
Chest x-rays sometimes differ from idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension 
and may demonstrate alveolar infiltrates and pleural effusions. High resolution 
computed tomography scans reveal ground glass opacities, interlobular septal 
thickening, and lymphadenopathy. Echocardiography can estimate the level of 
pulmonary artery pressures; right heart catheterization is needed for complete 
hemodynamic characterization of these patients. Lung biopsies demonstrate 
remodeling of the venules and small veins with intimal and adventitial fibrosis. 
This can result in total venous occlusion and subsequent recanalization. Similar 
changes occur in the small arteries and arterioles but are less pronounced than 
the venous changes. There is no effective medical therapy for these patients, 
and treatment with the pulmonary arterial hypertension specific medications 
often causes acute deterioration with pulmonary edema. The recent discovery of 
the biallelic mutations of the EIF2AK4 gene as an etiology for heritable form of 
pulmonary veno-occlusive disease increases our understanding of the disease 
pathogenesis and potentially identifies a future approach to treatment. Without 
definitive treatment, the prognosis is very poor, and the life expectancy of 
these patients is much shorter than patients with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. These patients need early referral to transplantation centers.

Oscillatory fungal cell growth.

Takeshita N(1).

Author information:

Japan. Electronic address: takeshita.norio.gf@u.tsukuba.ac.jp.

Cells are dynamic systems, the state of which undergoes constant alteration that 
results in morphological changes and movement. Many dynamic cellular processes 
that appear continuous are driven by underlying mechanisms that oscillate with 
distinct periods. For example eukaryotic cells do not grow continuously, but 
rather by pulsed extension of the periphery. Stepwise cell extension at the 
hyphal tips of several filamentous fungi was discovered 20 years ago, but only a 
few molecular details of the mechanism have been clarified since then. A recent 
study has provided evidence for correlations among intracellular Ca2+ levels, 
actin assembly, exocytosis and cell extension in growing hyphal tips. This 
suggests that pulsed Ca2+ influxes coordinate the temporal control of actin 
assembly and exocytosis, which results in stepwise cell extension. The 
coordinated oscillation of these machineries are likely to be ubiquitous among 
all eukaryotes. Indeed, intracellular Ca2+ levels and/or actin polymerization 
oscillate in mammalian and plant cells. This review summarizes the mechanisms of 
oscillation in several systems.

Cost-effectiveness of oral agents in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
compared to interferon-based therapy in Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND: Promising clinical and humanistic outcomes are associated with the 
use of new oral agents in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS). This is the first cost-effectiveness study comparing these 
medications in Saudi Arabia.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of fingolimod, 
teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, and interferon (IFN)-b1a products (Avonex and 
Rebif) as first-line therapies in the treatment of patients with RRMS from a 
Saudi payer perspective.
DESIGN: Cohort Simulation Model (Markov Model).
SETTING: Tertiary care hospital.
METHODS: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 RRMS Saudi patients was assumed to enter 
a Markov model model with a time horizon of 20 years and an annual cycle length. 
The model was developed based on an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the five disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) from 
a healthcare system perspective. Data on EDSS progression and relapse rates were 
obtained from the literature; cost data were obtained from King Faisal 
Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Results were 
expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary 
benefits (NMB) in Saudi Riyals and converted to equivalent $US. The base-case 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was assumed to be $100000 (SAR375000). 
One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were 
conducted to test the robustness of the model.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ICERs and NMB.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis results showed Rebif as the optimal therapy at a 
WTP threshold of $100000. Avonex had the lowest ICER value of $337282/QALY when 
compared to Rebif. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results 
were sensitive to utility weights of health state three and four and the cost of 
Rebif.
CONCLUSION: None of the DMDs were found to be cost-effective in the treatment of 
RRMS at a WTP threshold of $100000 in this analysis. The DMDs would only be 
cost-effective at a WTP above $300000.
LIMITATIONS: The current analysis did not reflect the Saudi population 
preference in valuation of health states and did not consider the societal 
perspective in terms of cost.

Management of large carnivores is among the most controversial topics in natural 
resource administration. Regulated hunting is a centrepiece of many carnivore 
management programmes and, although a number of hunting effects on population 
dynamics, body-size distributions and life history in other wildlife have been 
observed, its effects on life history and demography of large carnivores remain 
poorly documented. We report results from a 30-year study of brown bears (Ursus 
arctos) analysed using an integrated hierarchical approach. Our study revealed 
that regulated hunting has severely disrupted the interplay between age-specific 
survival and environmental factors, altered the consequences of reproductive 
strategies, and changed reproductive values and life expectancy in a population 
of the world's largest terrestrial carnivore. Protection and sustainable 
management have led to numerical recovery of several populations of large 
carnivores, but managers and policymakers should be aware of the extent to which 
regulated hunting may be influencing vital rates, thereby reshaping the life 
history of apex predators.

BACKGROUND: Intensive glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin 
[HbA1c] level <7%) is an established, cost-effective standard of care. However, 
guidelines recommend individualizing goals on the basis of age, comorbidity, 
diabetes duration, and complications.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of individualized control versus 
uniform intensive control (HbA1c level <7%) for the U.S. population with type 2 
diabetes.
DESIGN: Patient-level Monte Carlo-based Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2012.
TARGET POPULATION: The approximately 17.3 million persons in the United States 
with diabetes diagnosed at age 30 years or older.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Individualized versus uniform intensive glycemic control.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Average lifetime costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Individualized control saved $13 547 per patient 
compared with uniform intensive control ($105 307 vs. $118 854), primarily due 
to lower medication costs ($34 521 vs. $48 763). Individualized control 
decreased life expectancy (20.63 vs. 20.73 years) due to an increase in 
complications but produced more QALYs (16.68 vs. 16.58) due to fewer 
hypoglycemic events and fewer medications.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Individualized control was cost-saving and 
generated more QALYs compared with uniform intensive control, except in analyses 
where the disutility associated with receiving diabetes medications was 
decreased by at least 60%.
LIMITATION: The model did not account for effects of early versus later 
intensive glycemic control.
CONCLUSION: Health policies and clinical programs that encourage an 
individualized approach to glycemic control for U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes 
reduce costs and increase quality of life compared with uniform intensive 
control. Additional research is needed to confirm the risks and benefits of this 
strategy.

Knowing, Anticipating, Even Facilitating but Still not Intending: Another 
Challenge to Double Effect Reasoning.

A recent administrative law decision in Victoria, Australia, applied double 
effect reasoning in a novel way. Double effect reasoning has hitherto been used 
to legitimate treatments which may shorten life but where the intent of 
treatment is pain relief. The situation reviewed by the Victorian tribunal went 
further, supporting actions where a doctor agrees to provide pentobarbitone 
(Nembutal) to a patient at some time in the future if the patient feels at that 
time that his pain is unbearable and he wants to end his life. The offer to 
provide the drug was described as a palliative treatment in that it gave 
reassurance and comfort to the patient. Double effect reasoning was extended in 
this instance to encompass potentially facilitating a patient's death. This 
extension further muddies the murky double effect reasoning waters and creates 
another challenge to this concept.

AIM: We evaluated two treatment sequences, transarterial radioembolization 
followed by transarterial chemoembolization and possibly sorafenib (=TTS) versus 
transarterial radioembolization followed by sorafenib alone (=TS), to identify 
the most cost-effective pathway to treat intermediate-stage hepatocellular 
carcinoma from the Italian healthcare system perspective.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project costs and health 
outcomes for TTS and TS over a lifetime horizon. Data available at three 
hospitals in Italy were collected. Healthcare resource utilization was derived 
from standard clinical protocols. Costs were obtained from official regional 
tariffs.
RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Taking into consideration 16 patients for TTS and 
22 patients for TS pathways, the TTS sequence provided a dominant strategy in 
comparison to TS. Further evidence is desirable to confirm these results.

BACKGROUND: Because of the recent grade C draft recommendation by the US 
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for prostate cancer screening between 
the ages of 55 and 69 years, there is a need to determine whether this could be 
cost-effective in a US population setting.
METHODS: This study used a microsimulation model of screening and active 
surveillance (AS), based on data from the European Randomized Study of Screening 
for Prostate Cancer and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, 
for the natural history of prostate cancer and Johns Hopkins AS cohort data to 
inform the probabilities of referral to treatment during AS. A cohort of 10 
million men, based on US life tables, was simulated. The lifetime costs and 
effects of screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years with different 
screening frequencies and AS protocols were projected, and their 
cost-effectiveness was determined.
RESULTS: Quadrennial screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years (55, 59, 63, 
and 67 years) with AS for men with low-risk cancers (ie, those with a Gleason 
score of 6 or lower) and yearly biopsies or triennial biopsies resulted in an 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of $51,918 or $69,380, 
respectively. Most policies in which screening was followed by immediate 
treatment were dominated. In most sensitivity analyses, this study found a 
policy with which the cost per QALY remained below $100,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Prostate-specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening in the 
United States between the ages of 55 and 69 years, as recommended by the USPSTF, 
may be cost-effective at a $100,000 threshold but only with a quadrennial 
screening frequency and with AS offered to all low-risk men. Cancer

INTRODUCTION: The ability to maintain functional independence in a rapidly aging 
population results in an increased life expectancy without corresponding 
increases in health care costs. The accelerated decline in V˙O2peak after the 
age of 65 yr is primarily due to peripheral tissue changes rather than centrally 
mediated factors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the 
Peripheral Remodeling through Intermittent Muscular Exercise (PRIME) approach, 
consisting of a low-mass, high-repetition/duration skeletal muscle focused 
training regimen would provide superior functional benefits in participants 
older than 70 yr old and at risk for losing functional independence.
METHODS: In this clinical trial, 107 participants were randomized to 4 wk of 
either standard aerobic training (AT) or PRIME (phase 1). This was followed by 8 
wk of a progressive whole-body aerobic and resistance training (AT + RT) for all 
participants (phase 2). The major outcome measures were cardiorespiratory 
fitness (peak oxygen consumption [V˙O2peak]), muscular fitness (1 repetition 
maximal strength [1RM]), and physical function (Senior Fitness Test [SFT] 
scores). Results were analyzed under a per-protocol criterion.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight PRIME and 38 AT participants completed the 3-month 
protocols. V˙O2peak, 1RM, and SFT scores all increased significantly after 12 wk 
for both treatment groups (P < 0.05). However, relative to AT, participants 
randomized to PRIME demonstrated a greater increase in V˙O2peak (2.37 + 1.83 vs 
1.50 + 1.82 mL·kg·min, P < 0.05), 1RM (48.52 + 27.03 vs 28.01 + 26.15 kg, P < 
0.01) and SFT (22.50 + 9.98 vs 18.66 + 9.60 percentile, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Participants experienced greater increases in cardiorespiratory and 
muscular fitness and physical function when PRIME training was initiated before 
a combined AT + RT program. This novel exercise approach may be advantageous to 
individuals with other chronic disease conditions characterized by low 
functional capacity.

Increased life expectancy has promoted research on healthy aging. Aging is 
accompanied by increased non-specific immune activation (inflammaging) which 
favors the appearance of several disorders. Here, we study whether dietary 
supplementation with spray-dried animal plasma (SDP), which has been shown to 
reduce the activation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) in rodents 
challenged by S. aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), and can also prevent the effects of 
aging on immune system homeostasis. We first characterized GALT in a mouse model 
of accelerated senescence (SAMP8) at different ages (compared to mice resistant 
to accelerated senescence; SAMR1). Second, we analyzed the SDP effects on GALT 
response to an SEB challenge in SAMP8 mice. In GALT characterization, aging 
increased the cell number and the percentage of activated Th lymphocytes in 
mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (all, p < 0.05), as well as the 
expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in intestinal mucosa (both, p < 0.05). With respect 
to GALT response to the SEB challenge, young mice showed increased expression of 
intestinal IL-6 and TNF-α, as well as lymphocyte recruitment and activation 
(all, p < 0.05). However, the immune response of senescent mice to the SEB 
challenge was weak, since SEB did not change cell recruitment or the percentage 
of activated Th lymphocytes. Mice supplemented with SDP showed improved capacity 
to respond to the SEB challenge, similar to the response of the young mice. 
These results indicate that senescent mice have an impaired mucosal immune 
response characterized by unspecific GALT activation and a weak specific immune 
response. SDP supplementation reduces non-specific basal immune activation, 
allowing for the generation of specific responses.

Using Microsimulation to Estimate the Future Health and Economic Costs of 
Salmonellosis under Climate Change in Central Queensland, Australia.

Social Work, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, 
Australia.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of salmonellosis, a costly foodborne disease, is 
rising in Australia. Salmonellosis increases during high temperatures and 
rainfall, and future incidence is likely to rise under climate change. 
Allocating funding to preventative strategies would be best informed by accurate 
estimates of salmonellosis costs under climate change and by knowing which 
population subgroups will be most affected.
OBJECTIVE: We used microsimulation models to estimate the health and economic 
costs of salmonellosis in Central Queensland under climate change between 2016 
and 2036 to inform preventative strategies.
METHODS: We projected the entire population of Central Queensland to 2036 by 
simulating births, deaths, and migration, and salmonellosis and two resultant 
conditions, reactive arthritis and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. We 
estimated salmonellosis risks and costs under baseline conditions and under 
projected climate conditions for Queensland under the A1FI emissions scenario 
using composite projections from 6 global climate models (warm with reduced 
rainfall). We estimated the resulting costs based on direct medical expenditures 
combined with the value of lost quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on 
willingness-to-pay.
RESULTS: Estimated costs of salmonellosis between 2016 and 2036 increased from 
456.0 QALYs (95% CI: 440.3, 473.1) and AUD29,900,000 million (95% CI: 
AUD28,900,000, AUD31,600,000), assuming no climate change, to 485.9 QALYs (95% 
CI: 469.6, 503.5) and AUD31,900,000 (95% CI: AUD30,800,000, AUD33,000,000) under 
the climate change scenario.
CONCLUSION: We applied a microsimulation approach to estimate the costs of 
salmonellosis and its sequelae in Queensland during 2016-2036 under baseline 
conditions and according to climate change projections. This novel application 
of microsimulation models demonstrates the models' potential utility to 
researchers for examining complex interactions between weather and disease to 
estimate future costs. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1370.

INTRODUCTION: Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a widely used 
rehabilitation concept, although its efficacy has not yet been demonstrated in 
stroke survivors. The aim of this systematic review is to identify, assess and 
synthesise the potential benefits of using PNF to improve the activities of 
daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL) of individuals with stroke.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic electronic search will be conducted in 
MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and PEDro. We will include randomised or 
quasi-randomised controlled trials of PNF interventions conducted in stroke 
survivors up to April 2017. Two review authors will independently select 
relevant studies and will extract data using the Cochrane handbook for 
systematic reviews of interventions approach and the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The methodological 
quality will be assessed by using the PEDro scale. Finally, with the permitted 
numeric data, we will carry out a meta-analysis.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical considerations will not be required. Results 
will be disseminated in a peer-review journal. This systematic review aims to 
examine the effects of PNF (neurophysiological approach) in order to clarify its 
efficacy in improving ADL and QoL in the rehabilitation process of stroke 
survivors.

The Influence of Emerging Markets on the Pharmaceutical Industry.

Tannoury M(1), Attieh Z(1).

Beirut, Lebanon.

Emerging markets represent an exceptional opportunity for the pharmaceutical 
industry. Although a precise definition is not yet available, economists define 
emerging markets as developing prosperous countries in which investment is 
expected to result in higher income despite high risks. Qualifying a market as 
emerging is not merely based on the economic status of the country, but also on 
several criteria that render the definition applicable to each country. Jim 
O'Neil, retired chairman of asset management at Goldman Sachs, identified 
leading economies of emerging markets: Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) 
and later Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) and then 
Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, and Turkey (MIST), which followed years later as 
the second tier of nations. Sales of the pharmaceutical markets in BRICS and 
MIST countries doubled in 5 years, reaching a market share of approximately 20%. 
The shift toward these new markets has been attributed to the large populations, 
growing prosperity, and increasing life expectancy in BRICS and MIST countries. 
In addition, companies are experiencing flattened growth of developed markets, 
expiration of patents leading to the up-selling of less expensive generic drugs, 
and tight regulations enforced in mature markets. Particular attention must 
therefore be given to these emerging markets. The strategies adopted by 
pharmaceutical companies that want to expand in these markets must be tailored 
to the pace of development of each country. These countries need drugs against 
infectious diseases and communicable diseases such as sexually transmitted 
diseases. They are readily exploitable territories for the innovative products 
of pharmaceuticals. Nevertheless, with the increase in wealth and longevity, a 
change of lifestyle is occurring. These changes accompany a shift in disease 
patterns. A disproportionally fast rise in the incidence of noncommunicable 
diseases such as cardiovascular illnesses, diabetes, and oncologic diseases has 
been observed in emerging markets, mimicking their Western counterparts. The 
incidence of diabetes and oncologic diseases is expected to grow by 20% or more 
by 2030. This shows that pharmaceutical industries will also be able to market 
their global products in these new countries. Conquering emerging markets can be 
challenging for industries. These challenges can be grouped into 3 categories: 
infrastructure development, cost-containment policies, and value-driven drug 
evaluation. Top strategies considered to overcome these challenges include 
adequate tailoring and a gain in market.
