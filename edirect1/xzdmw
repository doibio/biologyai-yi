Protein drugs hold great promise as therapeutics for a wide range of diseases. 
Unfortunately, one of the greatest challenges to be addressed during clinical 
development of protein therapeutics is their short circulation half-life. 
Several protein conjugation strategies have been developed for half-life 
extension. However, these strategies have limitations and there remains room for 
improvement. Here, we report a novel nature-inspired strategy for enhancing the 
in vivo half-life of proteins. Our strategy involves conjugating proteins to a 
hydrophilic small molecule that binds reversibly to the plasma protein, 
transthyretin. We show here that our strategy is effective in enhancing the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of human interleukin 2 in rats, 
potentially opening the door for more effective and safer cancer 
immunotherapies. To our knowledge, this is the first example of successful use 
of a small-molecule that not only extends the half-life but also maintains the 
smaller size, binding potency, and hydrophilicity of proteins.

The actin cytoskeleton plays a fundamental role in the regulation of multiple 
cellular pathways, including trafficking and locomotion. The functional 
integrity of the cytoskeleton is important during aging, as the decline of 
cytoskeletal integrity contributes to the physiological consequence of aging. 
Moreover, improving cytoskeletal form and function throughout aging is 
sufficient to drive life span extension and promote organismal health in 
multiple model systems. For these reasons, optimized protocols for visualization 
of the actin cytoskeleton and its downstream consequences on health span and 
life span are critical for understanding the aging process. In C. elegans, the 
actin cytoskeleton shows diverse morphologies across tissues, potentially due to 
the significantly different functions of each cell type. This chapter describes 
an imaging platform utilizing LifeAct to visualize the actin cytoskeleton in 
live, whole nematodes throughout the aging process and methods to perform 
follow-up studies on the life span and health span of these organisms.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accurate epidemiological information is essential for 
the improved understanding of dystonia syndromes, as well as better provisioning 
of clinical services and providing context for diagnostic decision-making. Here, 
we determine epidemiological, social deprivation, and mortality characteristics 
of adult-onset idiopathic dystonia in the Welsh population.
METHODS: A retrospective population-based cohort study using anonymized 
electronic health care data in Wales was conducted to identify individuals with 
dystonia between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2017. We developed a 
case-ascertainment algorithm to determine dystonia incidence and prevalence, as 
well as characterization of the dystonia cohort, based on social deprivation and 
mortality.
RESULTS: The case-ascertainment algorithm (79% sensitivity) identified 54,966 
cases; of these cases, 41,660 had adult-onset idiopathic dystonia (≥20 years). 
Amongst the adult-onset form, the median age at diagnosis was 41 years, with 
males significantly older at time of diagnosis compared to females. Prevalence 
rates ranged from 0.02% in 1994 to 1.2% in 2017. The average annual incidence 
was 87.7/100,000/year, increasing from 49.9/100,000/year (1994) to 
96.21/100,000/year (2017). In 2017, people with dystonia had a similar life 
expectancy to the Welsh population.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a case-ascertainment algorithm, supported by the 
introduction of a neurologist-reviewed validation cohort, providing a platform 
for future population-based dystonia studies. We have established robust 
population-level prevalence and incidence values for adult-onset idiopathic 
forms of dystonia, with this reflecting increasing clinical recognition and 
identification of causal genes. Underlying causes of death mirrored those of the 
general population, including circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders, 
cancers, and dementia.

BACKGROUND: Fully assessing the mortality burden of the COVID-19 pandemic 
requires measuring years of life lost (YLLs) and accounting for quality-of-life 
differences.
OBJECTIVE: To measure YLLs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidity.
DESIGN: State-transition microsimulation model.
DATA SOURCES: Health and Retirement Study, Panel Study of Income Dynamics, data 
on excess deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 
nursing home death counts from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
TARGET POPULATION: U.S. population aged 25 years and older.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Individual.
INTERVENTION: COVID-19 pandemic through 13 March 2021.
OUTCOME MEASURES: YLLs and QALYs lost per 10 000 persons in the population. The 
estimates account for the age, sex, and race/ethnicity of decedents, along with 
obesity, smoking behavior, lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, 
stroke, hypertension, dementia, and nursing home residence.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in 6.62 million 
QALYs lost (9.08 million YLLs) through 13 March 2021, with 3.6 million (54%) 
lost by those aged 25 to 64 years. The greatest toll was on Black and Hispanic 
communities, especially among men aged 65 years or older, who lost 1138 and 1371 
QALYs, respectively, per 10 000 persons. Absent the pandemic, 38% of decedents 
would have had average or above-average life expectancies for their subgroup 
defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Accounting for uncertainty in risk factors for 
death from COVID-19 yielded similar results.
LIMITATION: Estimates may vary depending on assumptions about mortality and 
quality-of-life projections.
CONCLUSION: Beyond excess deaths alone, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed a greater 
life expectancy burden on persons aged 25 to 64 years, including those with 
average or above-average life expectancies, and a disproportionate burden on 
Black and Hispanic communities.

Estimating environmental lead exposure using ecologic risk models is an 
inexpensive strategy to inform public health departments and to develop 
location-based intervention strategies such as targeted screening and 
mitigation. Importantly, studies in this area have not assessed temporal and 
spatio-temporal lead exposure risk trends. Due to lead abatement efforts and 
targeted screening efforts, it is anticipated that lead exposure risk has 
decreased over time. However, it is unknown if decreases have occurred, and if 
the decreases are evenly distributed across neighborhoods. Thus, the purpose of 
this study was to examine the association between neighborhood deprivation and 
risk of elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) in both temporal and spatio-temporal 
contexts within the US state of Maryland in 2005-2015. To consider the temporal 
dimension of lead risk, we used a novel extension of Bayesian index models to 
estimate time-varying neighborhood deprivation indices along with time-varying 
index effects. The results showed that overall EBLL proportion decreased over 
time, from a high of 0.11 in 2006 to a low of 0.02 in 2015. The association 
between neighborhood deprivation and EBLL risk was positive and significant 
annually, but generally diminished over time. The most important variables in 
the neighborhood deprivation index were percent of houses built before 1940 and 
median household income. In summary, using Bayesian index models that can 
account for both temporal and spatio-temporal contexts is a promising approach 
to inform public health efforts to remediate lead and focus testing efforts and 
may be useful in studies in other geographic areas and times.

Increasing life expectancy, a sedentary lifestyle and bone diseases all 
contribute to an increasing demand for endoprostheses. Currently, the service 
life of a knee prosthesis is 10-17 years on average, depending on the patient's 
weight and activity. In addition, the most common reasons for revision 
operations after implantation are prosthesis loosening and infections resulting 
from the lack of implant-bone connection. That is why it is so important to 
constantly search for new materials or improve the current methods of obtaining 
biomaterials and modifying their surfaces. The main goal of the research is to 
improve the bonding of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the surface of titanium alloy, 
which is used in the construction of endoprostheses. At this stage of the 
research, octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) deposited on the surface of the 
Ti6Al4V ELI alloy was analyzed. To verify the layer, HA attachment (the 
precipitation process) was first checked, and then the modified plates were 
immersed in a synthetic body fluid (SBF) to simulate the conditions in the 
living organism. At each stage of the study, the samples were analyzed using: 
SEM, EDS and Raman spectroscopy - spectral measurements and surface mapping were 
performed. The study were supplemented by the measurements of the contact angle 
- checking the wettability of the surface, which is important for the analysis 
of biomaterials and surface roughness measurements by confocal microscopy. The 
results shows that ODPA it increases the amount of precipitation of HA when 
dipped in SBF. Another interesting finding is that the addition of ODPA to the 
annealed titanium alloy restricts the precipitation of HA on its surface.

of Medicine, Japan.

The goal of diabetes treatment is to maintain good glycemic control, prevent the 
development and progression of diabetic complications, and ensure the same 
quality of life and life expectancy as healthy people. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is 
used as an index of glycemic control, but strict glycemic control using HbA1c as 
an index may lead to severe hypoglycemia and cardiovascular death. Glycemic 
variability (GV), such as excessive hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, is 
associated with diabetic vascular complications and has been recognized as an 
important index of glycemic control. Here, we reviewed the definition and 
evaluated the clinical usefulness of GV, and its relationship with diabetic 
complications and therapeutic strategies to reduce GV.

Studies conducted in developed nations have shown that increase in life 
expectancy has brought with it a rise in the incidence and treatment of 
degenerative aortic and mitral heart valve diseases. Current standards recommend 
valve replacement among even some asymptomatic patients. In this research, we 
examine the epidemiology of valvular heart disease and rate of valve replacement 
in Taiwan, where life expectancy now stands at 80.69 years. Patients were 
enrolled based on claims from a widely used national database and categorized 
into cohorts defined by type of valve disease and, further, by valve 
replacements and type of valve (mechanical, porcine, or bovine). Data, including 
disease type, age, and gender, were analyzed to determine annual and cumulative 
incidence rates and prosthetic usage from 2000 to 2017. Results showed that 
across the cohorts, the cumulative incidence rate in 2017 was 3.59%, and in the 
aortic valve cohort, the percentage of surgical valve replacement for those ≥60 
years was 6.99%. Compared with other developed nations, this demonstrates that 
incidence rates are slightly higher, yet surgical replacements are less than 
half that of other developed nations. This under-treatment of patients with 
valvular heart disease presents an important public health challenge in Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: While guidelines recommend against routine screening for breast, 
prostate, and colorectal cancers in older adults (65+ years) with <10-year life 
expectancy, many of these patients continue to be screened. How clinicians 
consider screening cessation across multiple cancer screening types is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To compare and contrast clinicians' perspectives on discontinuing 
breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer screenings in older adults.
DESIGN: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews.
PARTICIPANTS: Primary care clinicians in Maryland (N=30) APPROACH: We conducted 
semi-structured interviews with individual clinicians. Interviews were recorded, 
transcribed, and analyzed using standard techniques of qualitative content 
analysis to identify major themes.
KEY RESULTS: Participants were mostly physicians (24/30) and women (16/30). Four 
major themes highlighted differences in decision-making across cancer 
screenings: (1) Clinicians reported more often screening beyond 
guideline-recommended ages for breast and prostate cancers than colorectal 
cancer; (2) clinicians had different priorities when considering the 
benefits/harms of each screening; for example, some prioritized continuing 
colorectal cancer screening due to the test's high efficacy while others 
prioritized stopping colorectal cancer screening due to high procedural risk; 
some prioritized continuing prostate cancer screening due to poor outcomes from 
advanced prostate cancer while others prioritized stopping prostate cancer 
screening due to high false positive test rates and harms from downstream tests; 
(3) clinicians discussed harms of prostate and colorectal cancer screening more 
readily than for breast cancer screening; (4) clinicians perceived more 
involvement with gastroenterologists in colonoscopy decisions and less 
involvement from specialists for prostate and breast cancer screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for more explicit guidance on how to 
weigh competing considerations in cancer screening (such as test accuracy versus 
ease of cancer treatment after detection). Recognizing the complexity of the 
benefit/harms analysis as clinicians consider multiple cancer screenings, future 
decision support tools, and clinician education materials can specifically 
address the competing considerations.

The standard approach for dose individualization of chemotherapy in the oncology 
setting has long been based on body surface area (BSA) as a measure of body 
size. However, for many anticancer drugs, administration of dosages based on BSA 
may result in some patients receiving supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic 
concentrations due to substantial interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. 
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided dosing aims to ensure that the 
patient's serum drug concentration is in a target range which has been shown to 
produce optimal clinical outcomes. The management of several malignancies is now 
moving away from using traditional intravenous chemotherapy to longer-term 
treatment with targeted molecular therapies. These targeted anticancer drugs are 
currently dosed based on a fixed dose for all patients. The pharmacokinetic 
characteristics of most of these drugs (e.g., tyrosine-kinase inhibitors) 
support implementation of individualized dosing via TDM. However, prior to 
adopting TDM-guided dosing in oncology settings, the economic efficiency and 
value for money of introducing TDM interventions should be critically and 
systematically examined along with the impacts on patient care and outcomes. 
Yet, current evidence in this area is limited, and more generally, there is lack 
of methodological guidance on how to identify, estimate and value clinical and 
cost information necessary to conduct economic evaluations of TDM interventions. 
In this paper, we propose a coherent framework for conducting economic 
evaluation of TDM interventions in oncology settings and discuss some practical 
challenges of conducting economic evaluations of TDM.

Beta-diversity was originally defined spatially, i.e., as variation in community 
composition among sites in a region. However, the concept of beta-diversity has 
since been expanded to temporal contexts. This is referred to as "temporal 
beta-diversity", and most approaches are simply an extension of spatial 
beta-diversity. The persistence and turnover of individuals over time is a 
unique feature of temporal beta-diversity. Nakadai (2020) introduced the 
"individual-based beta-diversity" concept, and provided novel indices to 
evaluate individual turnover and compositional shift by comparing individual 
turnover between two periods at a given site. However, the proposed 
individual-based indices are applicable only to pairwise dissimilarity, not to 
multiple-temporal (or more generally, multiple-unit) dissimilarity. Here, 
individual-based beta-diversity indices are extended to multiple-unit cases. In 
addition, a novel type of random permutation criterion related to these 
multiple-unit indices for detecting patterns of individual persistence is 
introduced in the present study. To demonstrate the usage the properties of 
these indices compared to average pairwise measures, I applied them to a dataset 
for a permanent 50-ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. 
Information regarding "individuals" is generally missing from community ecology 
and biodiversity studies of temporal dynamics. In this context, the methods 
proposed here are expected to be useful for addressing a wide range of research 
questions regarding temporal changes in biodiversity, especially studies using 
traditional individual-tracked forest monitoring data.

PURPOSE: The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life (IBS-QoL) questionnaire is 
a commonly used and validated IBS-specific QoL instrument. However, this 
questionnaire is in contrast to the EQ-5D-5L, not preference-based and as such 
does not allow calculation of QALYs. The objective of this study was to describe 
the convergent- and known-group validity of both questionnaires and to develop a 
mapping algorithm from EQ-5D-5L which enable IBS-QoL scores to be transformed 
into utility scores for use in economic evaluations.
METHODS: We used data from two multicenter randomized clinical trials, which 
represented the estimation and external validation dataset. The convergent 
validity was investigated by examining correlations between the EQ-5D-5L and 
IBS-QoL and the known-group validity by calculating effect sizes. Ordinary least 
squares (OLS), censored least absolute deviations (CLAD), and mixture models 
were used in this mapping approach.
RESULTS: 283 IBS patients were included (n = 189 vs. n = 84). Mean IBS-QoL score 
was 71.13 (SD 15.66) and mean EQ-5D-5L utility score was 0.73 (SD 0.19). The 
overall sensitivity of the IBS-QoL and EQ-5D-5L to discriminate between patient 
and disease characteristics was similar. CLAD model 4, containing the total 
IBS-QoL score and squared IBS-SSS (IBS severity scoring system), was chosen as 
the most appropriate model to transform IBS-QoL scores into EQ-5D-5L utility 
scores.
CONCLUSION: This study reports the development of an algorithm where the 
condition-specific questionnaire IBS-QoL can be used to calculate utility values 
for use in economic evaluations. Including a clinical measure, IBS-SSS, in the 
model improved the performance of the algorithm.

High-dose radiation exposure and hypothyroidism: aetiology, prevention and 
replacement therapy.

Without any doubt, high dose radiation exposure can induce hypothyroidism. 
However, there are open questions related to the mechanisms of its induction, 
corresponding dose thresholds and possible countermeasures. Therefore, this 
review addresses the aetiology, prevention and therapy of radiation induced 
hypothyroidism. External beam radiotherapy with several 10 Gy to the head and 
neck region and radioiodine therapy with several 100 Gy thyroid absorbed dose 
can destroy the thyroid gland and can induce autoantibodies against thyroid 
tissue. According to recent literature, clinical hypothyroidism is observed at 
threshold doses of ∼10 Gy after external beam radiotherapy and of ∼50 Gy after 
radioiodine therapy, children being more sensitive than adults. In children and 
adolescents exposed by the Chernobyl accident with mean thyroid absorbed doses 
of 500-800 mGy, subclinical hypothyroidism has been detected in 3%-6% of the 
cases with significant correlation to thyroid absorbed doses above 2.5 Gy. In 
case of nuclear emergencies, iodine thyroid blocking (ITB) is the method of 
choice to keep thyroid absorbed doses low. Large doses of stable iodine affect 
two different steps of internalization of radioiodine (transport and 
organification); perchlorate affecting the transport only may be an alternative 
to iodine. Administered before radioiodine incorporation, the effect of 100 mg 
iodide or more is still about 90% after 1 days, 80% after 2 days, and 50% or 
less after 3 days. If administered (too) late after exposure to radioiodine, the 
theoretically expected protective effect of ITB is about 50% after 6 h, 25% 
after 12 h, and about 6% after 24 h. In case of repeated or continuous exposure, 
repeated administration of 50 mg of iodide daily is indicated. If 
radiation-induced hypothyroidism cannot be avoided, thyroid hormone replacement 
therapy with individualized dosing and regular monitoring in order to maintain 
thyroid-stimulating hormone levels within the normal range ensures normal life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: This study analyzed neck pain estimates in Brazil and its states 
between 2000 and 2019, in view of the country's lacking epidemiological data.
METHODS: An analysis was performed of the GBD 2019 estimates by location, sex, 
and age, per 100,000 population, with uncertainty intervals (95% UI). Brazilian 
estimates were compared to global, Mexican, English, and American rates.
RESULTS: Global, Brazilian, and Mexican prevalence numbers were statistically 
homogeneous and stable in the period. Throughout the period analyzed in the 
study, Brazilian neck pain prevalence (2241.9; 95%UI 1770.5-2870.6) did not show 
statistical differences when compared to global (2696.5; 95%UI 2177.0-3375.2) or 
Mexican (1595.9; 95%UI 1258.9-2058.8) estimates. Estimates observed in the USA 
(5123.29; 95%UI 4268.35-6170.35) and England (4612.5; 95%UI 3668.8-5830.3) were 
significantly higher. In 2019, when compared to the USA and England, 
age-standardized prevalences were lower globally, in Brazil, and in Mexico. 
Prevalences in Brazilian states were similar, being that Roraima (1915.9; 95%UI 
1506.5-2443.1) and the Federal District (1932.05; 95%UI 1515.1-2462.7) presented 
the lowest and highest values respectively. The exception was the state of São 
Paulo (3326.5; 95%UI 2609.6-4275.5). There was no statistical difference by sex, 
but the prevalence tended to increase with aging. In 2019, the Brazilian 
prevalence was 2478.6 (95% UI 1791.0-3503.8), 5017.2 (95%UI 3257.26-7483.8), and 
4293.4 (95% UI 2898,8-6343.9), for those aged 15 to 49, 50 to 69, and 70+ years. 
There was no statistical difference among the YLDs in all locations and times.
CONCLUSIONS: Brazil is going through a fast-paced process of populational aging; 
a higher prevalence of neck pain in middle-aged individuals and the elderly 
highlights the need for lifelong prevention initiatives. The higher rates 
observed among higher-income populations and the homogeneity of the Brazilian 
estimates suggest a lack of robust epidemiological data in lower-income 
countries.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether in preterm neonates parenteral nutrition use in 
the first 7 postnatal days, compared with no parenteral nutrition use, is 
associated with differences in survival and other important morbidities. 
Randomised trials in critically ill older children show that harms, such as 
nosocomial infection, outweigh benefits of early parenteral nutrition 
administration; there is a paucity of similar data in neonates.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using propensity matching including 35 
maternal, infant and organisational factors to minimise bias and confounding.
SETTING: National, population-level clinical data obtained for all National 
Health Service neonatal units in England and Wales.
PATIENTS: Preterm neonates born between 30+0 and 32+6 weeks+days.
INTERVENTIONS: The exposure was parenteral nutrition administered in the first 
7 days of postnatal life; the comparator was no parenteral nutrition.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was survival to discharge from 
neonatal care. Secondary outcomes comprised the neonatal core outcome set.
RESULTS: 16 292 neonates were compared in propensity score matched analyses. 
Compared with matched neonates not given parenteral nutrition in the first 
postnatal week, neonates who received parenteral nutrition had higher survival 
at discharge (absolute rate increase 0.91%; 95% CI 0.53% to 1.30%), but higher 
rates of necrotising enterocolitis (absolute rate increase 4.6%), 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (absolute rate increase 3.9%), late-onset sepsis 
(absolute rate increase 1.5%) and need for surgical procedures (absolute rate 
increase 0.92%).
CONCLUSIONS: In neonates born between 30+0 and 32+6 weeks' gestation, those 
given parenteral nutrition in the first postnatal week had a higher rate of 
survival but higher rates of important neonatal morbidities. Clinician equipoise 
in this area should be resolved by prospective randomised trials.

Use of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has become indispensable in life science 
research. Raw HTS data contains several sequencing artifacts, and as a first 
step it is imperative to remove the artifacts for reliable downstream 
bioinformatics analysis. Although there are multiple stand-alone tools available 
that can perform the various quality control steps separately, availability of 
an integrated tool that can allow one-step, automated quality control analysis 
of HTS datasets will significantly enhance handling large number of samples 
parallelly. Here, we developed HTSQualC, a stand-alone, flexible, and 
easy-to-use software for one-step quality control analysis of raw HTS data. 
HTSQualC can evaluate HTS data quality and perform filtering and trimming 
analysis in a single run. We evaluated the performance of HTSQualC for 
conducting batch analysis of HTS datasets with 322 samples with an average ~ 1 M 
(paired end) sequence reads per sample. HTSQualC accomplished the QC analysis 
in ~ 3 h in distributed mode and ~ 31 h in shared mode, thus underscoring its 
utility and robust performance. In addition to command-line execution, we 
integrated HTSQualC into the free, open-source, CyVerse cyberinfrastructure 
resource as a GUI interface, for wider access to experimental biologists who 
have limited computational resources and/or programming abilities.

Alterations in the function of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are largely 
associated with the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a 
devastating disease of the human motor system that leads to motoneurons 
degeneration and reduced life expectancy by molecular mechanisms not well known. 
In our previous work, we found that the expression levels of the glutamic acid 
decarboxylase enzyme (GAD1), responsible for converting glutamate to 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), were downregulated in TBPH-null flies and 
motoneurons derived from ALS patients carrying mutations in TDP-43, suggesting 
that defects in the regulation of GAD1 may lead to neurodegeneration by 
affecting neurotransmitter balance. In this study, we observed that TBPH was 
required for the regulation of GAD1 pre-mRNA splicing and the levels of GABA in 
the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). Interestingly, we discovered that 
pharmacological treatments aimed to potentiate GABA neurotransmission were able 
to revert locomotion deficiencies in TBPH-minus flies, revealing novel 
mechanisms and therapeutic strategies in ALS.

BACKGROUND: Despite its widespread implementation, it is unclear whether 
Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) are safe and improve the 
delivery of care that patients desire. We sought to systematically review the 
influence of POLST on treatment intensity among patients with serious illness 
and/or frailty.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of POLST and similar programs using 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews, and PsycINFO, from inception through 
February 28, 2020. We included adults with serious illness and/or frailty with 
life expectancy <1 year. Primary outcomes included place of death and receipt of 
high-intensity treatment (i.e., hospitalization in the last 30- and 90-days of 
life, ICU admission in the last 30-days of life, and number of care setting 
transitions in last week of life).
RESULTS: Among 104,554 patients across 20 observational studies, 27,090 had 
POLST. No randomized controlled trials were identified. The mean age of POLST 
users was 78.7 years, 55.3% were female, and 93.0% were white. The majority of 
POLST users (55.3%) had orders for comfort measures only. Most studies showed 
that, compared to full treatment orders on POLST, treatment limitations were 
associated with decreased in-hospital death and receipt of high-intensity 
treatment, particularly in pre-hospital settings. However, in the acute care 
setting, a sizable number of patients likely received POLST-discordant care. The 
overall strength of evidence was moderate based on eight retrospective cohort 
studies of good quality that showed a consistent, similar direction of outcomes 
with moderate-to-large effect sizes.
CONCLUSION: We found moderate strength of evidence that treatment limitations on 
POLST may reduce treatment intensity among patients with serious illness. 
However, the evidence base is limited and demonstrates potential unintended 
consequences of POLST. We identify several important knowledge gaps that should 
be addressed to help maximize benefits and minimize risks of POLST.

The aim of this study was to analyze the results of infrapopliteal venous and 
prosthetic bypass surgeries for patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia 
(CLTI) and moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). All consecutive 
patients undergoing infrapopliteal bypass surgeries at two academic vascular 
centers between March 2002 and November 2018 were included in this retrospective 
study. During this timeframe, infrapopliteal grafts were performed for 487 
patients. Of these patients, 160 (32.9%; group 1) had normal renal function, 248 
(50.9%; group 2) had moderate CKD, and 79 (16.2%; group 3) had severe CKD 
according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. After 5 
years' follow-up, the primary patency rate was 46.0% and the secondary patency 
rate was 54.9% without statistical significance noted between the CKD groups. 
Limb salvage (65.3%, p = 0.024) and long-term survival (19.6%, p < 0.001) were 
considerably lower in patients with severe CKD. In subgroup analysis, vein 
grafts had significantly better long-term patency rates compared to prosthetic 
grafts, regardless of CKD group. However, in patients with severe CKD, patency 
rates of vein and heparin-bonded expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (HePTFE) 
grafts were comparable at the 1-year mark. Our study shows that autologous vein 
grafts remain the first choice for infrapopliteal bypass surgeries in patients 
with CKD. HePTFE grafts showed good short-term results in patients with severe 
CKD. Given the short life expectancy of these high-risk patients, prosthetic 
HePTFE grafts may be reasonable in this population if a suitable vein is absent.
