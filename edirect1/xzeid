and/or a poor tumor differentiation should be considered high risk. Complete 
staging and consideration of additional treatments (chemotherapy and/or 
radiotherapy and/or surgery) or strict endoscopic follow-up should be undertaken 
on an individual basis in a multidisciplinary discussion.Strong recommendation, 
low quality of evidence. MR10 A: ESGE recommends that the first endoscopic 
follow-up after successful endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) of BE is 
performed in an expert center.Strong recommendation, very low quality of 
evidence. B:  ESGE recommends careful inspection of the neo-squamocolumnar 
junction and neo-squamous epithelium with high definition white-light endoscopy 
and virtual chromoendoscopy during post-EET surveillance, to detect recurrent 
dysplasia.Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence. C:  ESGE recommends 
against routine four-quadrant biopsies of neo-squamous epithelium after 
successful EET of BE.Strong recommendation, low level of evidence. D:  ESGE 
suggests, after successful EET, obtaining four-quadrant random biopsies just 
distal to a normal-appearing neo-squamocolumnar junction to detect dysplasia in 
the absence of visible lesions.Weak recommendation, low level of evidence. E: 
 ESGE recommends targeted biopsies are obtained where there is a suspicion of 
recurrent BE in the tubular esophagus, or where there are visible lesions 
suspicious for dysplasia.Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence. 
MR11:  After successful EET, ESGE recommends the following surveillance 
intervals:- For patients with a baseline diagnosis of HGD or EAC:at 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 7, and 10 years after last treatment, after which surveillance may be 
stopped.- For patients with a baseline diagnosis of LGD:at 1, 3, and 5 years 
after last treatment, after which surveillance may be stopped.Strong 
recommendation, low quality of evidence.

OBJECTIVES: There is a need for better information exchange between primary and 
secondary care healthcare professionals in cancer patients with limited life 
expectancy, most of whom prefer to be at home but are admitted frequently at the 
end of life (EoL). We conducted a file search to assess this among our patients 
and developed a discharge pathway to decrease readmission rate and dying in 
hospital.
DATA SOURCES: We performed an in-depth file search among 150 patients who died 
within 1 month after hospital admission (July 2013 to January 2014); 60 were 
admitted once, and 90 were admitted twice or more. Mean time spent in hospital 
at EoL was 12 days; 37% died in hospital, and 49% died at home. We included 31 
admitted cancer patients at the EoL in whom home-discharge was planned for the 
intervention (February 2017 to December 2018). Median survival was 24 days, time 
spent in hospital decreased from 15.5 to 2.5 days, and number of readmissions 
fell from 2.8 to 0.57. One patient (3.1%) died in hospital, and 77% died at 
home. And 78% of general practitioners found the provided information useful.
CONCLUSION: A proactive discharge pathway may reduce hospital readmission rates, 
time spent in hospital, and in-hospital death.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Ever more patients with complex care needs at 
the EoL are being discharged early. Being informed about patients' wishes, 
preferences, and treatment options for symptom management at home is essential 
for doctors and nurses in primary care. A systematic discharge pathway can be 
useful for information transfer when admitted patients are discharged home.

Depression is a major public health concern. Depressed individuals have received 
increasing treatment with antidepressants in Western countries. In this study, 
we examine the relationship among individual symptoms (sadness, worry and 
unhappiness), human development factors and antidepressant use in 29 OECD 
countries. We report that increased antidepressant prescribing is not associated 
with decreased prevalence of sadness, worry or unhappiness. However, income, 
education and life expectancy (measured using the Human Development Index) are 
associated with lower prevalence of all these symptoms. This suggests that 
increasing spending on depression treatment may not be as effective as general 
public health interventions at reducing depression in communities.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC? Traditionally, life expectancy has 
served as a pivotal measure for assessing population health. However, there is 
an increasing focus on distinguishing healthy years of life from those 
characterized by illness, particularly among the elderly population.
WHAT IS ADDED BY THIS REPORT? This study conducts an exhaustive global analysis 
of the trends in healthy and unhealthy life expectancy among adults aged 60 and 
over from 1990 to 2019. These trends are further correlated with 
socio-demographic indicators and health services metrics.
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE? Comprehending the dynamics 
between healthy and unhealthy life years can equip policymakers with the 
necessary insights to prioritize interventions. These interventions can thereby 
secure both quality and longevity of life for the increasingly aging population.

Narrative review of the role of technology in pediatric diabetes: from testing 
blood glucose to subcutaneous automated therapy and hope for cure.

Author information:
(1)Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, McGovern Medical School 
at the University Texas Health Houston, Houston, TX, USA.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type 1 diabetes, the most common cause of diabetes in 
pediatrics, is defined by the hyperglycemia that results from the permanent 
autoimmune damage to the pancreas. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial 
(DCCT) demonstrated that strict glycemic control targeting lower HbA1c goals can 
both delay the onset and progression of its complications that include diabetic 
neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and increased cardiovascular events. Our 
primary objective is to review the literature available regarding the technology 
applied for the treatment of diabetes, not only aiding patients' quality of life 
but addressing its effects on hypoglycemia and reduced risk of the long-term 
complications. It will synthesize the evolution of glucose monitoring devices; 
the development of insulin: from animal to recombinant engineering, smart 
insulin in the future; the development of algorithm-driven insulin delivery 
devices, the closed loop system/artificial pancreas; and the future utilization 
of technology to support islet cell transplant with the goal of a long-term 
cure. Emphasis will be made on what is known about the impact on its outcomes in 
children and adolescents.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed for publications from 
1985 to present. Keywords used: type 1 diabetes, children, adolescents, 
pediatrics, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), insulin pumps. Referenced 
articles include other reviews, current care guidelines as supported by cross 
sectional studies, cohort studies and randomized clinical trials.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Understanding the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes 
has led to the design of technology that facilitates glucose monitoring and 
insulin administration in a personalized manner. The current technology has 
improved outcomes and quality of life by decreasing hypoglycemic events and 
decreasing risk of long-term metabolic complications. Barriers remain, for 
children and adults, often driven by patient's preference as well as their 
understanding of the limitations of what they are wearing.
CONCLUSIONS: With the progressive evolution of this technology, it is now 
realistic to lower the burden of diabetes self-management while reducing 
hypoglycemia and risk of complications that otherwise impact daily life from 
academics, physical activity, career choices and even life expectancy.

Philadelphia, USA.

Objectives To study the pattern of inflammatory markers in meconium aspiration 
syndrome (MAS) and their correlation with illness severity/antibiotic usage. 
Study design This is a retrospective analysis of neonates who were admitted with 
MAS and had inflammatory markers done during the first week of life. Results 
Seventy-six neonates with MAS were identified. White cell count (WCC), absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC), and immature to total neutrophil count (I/T) 
ratio peaked at 12 and CRP (43.75 mg/dl) at 48 hours of life (HOL). Neonates 
needing nasal cannula oxygen had lower CRP at 12 (p=0.035) and 24 HOL (p=0.046). 
There was no correlation between CRP at 48 HOL and score for neonatal acute 
physiology and perinatal extension II (SNAPPE-II; R2 0.0004). High CRP at 24 HOL 
was associated with longer duration of antibiotics (p<0.001) despite no 
correlation with the blood cultures. Conclusion MAS was associated with 
inflammatory markers peaking at 12 to 48 HOL; however, antibiotics should not be 
determined based on them as their correlation for illness severity or blood 
culture is poor.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Geographic atrophy is an advanced and currently untreatable 
form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which leads to significant 
compromise of visual function and quality of life. Dysregulation of the 
complement cascade has been directly implicated in AMD pathogenesis. 
Pegcetacoplan is a pegylated highly selective bicyclic peptide that inhibits the 
cleavage of complement component 3 (C3), which represents a key step in 
propagation of the complement cascade. The phase 2 FILLY trial as well as the 
phase 3 OAKS and DERBY trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of 
pegcetacoplan for the treatment of GA.
RECENT FINDINGS: The FILLY, OAKS and DERBY trials have demonstrated that local 
inhibition of C3 cleavage with pegcetacoplan can reduce geographic atrophy 
lesion growth compared with sham with an effect size of approximately 11-35% 
depending on the specific trial and specific geographic atrophy phenotype 
considered. Overall pegcetacoplan has appeared to be well tolerated with the 
notable side effect of a dose-dependent increase in the rate of exudative AMD 
development in treated eyes.
SUMMARY: The FILLY, OAKS and DERBY trials have demonstrated that pegcetacoplan 
is a potentially viable treatment for geographic atrophy. Additional data from 
the 2-year outcomes of DERBY and OAKS as well as data from the ongoing 3-year 
GALE extension study will provide additional insights into the potential 
therapeutic benefit of pegcetacoplan. Future studies assessing complement 
inhibition at earlier stages of AMD, with the goal of preventing geographic 
atrophy formation, are warranted.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have become the leading global burden of diseases 
in recent years and are the primary cause of human mortality and loss of healthy 
life expectancy. Myocardial infarction (MI) is the top cause of CVDs-related 
deaths, and its incidence is increasing worldwide every year. Recently, 
hydrogels have garnered great interest from researchers as a promising 
therapeutic option for cardiac tissue repair after MI. This is due to their 
excellent properties, including biocompatibility, mechanical properties, 
injectable properties, anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidant properties, 
angiogenic properties, and conductive properties. This review discusses the 
advantages of hydrogels as a novel treatment for cardiac tissue repair after MI. 
The design strategies of various hydrogels in MI treatment are then summarized, 
and the latest research progress in the field is classified. Finally, the future 
perspectives of this booming field are also discussed at the end of this review.

IMPORTANCE: Bipolar disorder affects approximately 8 million adults in the US 
and approximately 40 million individuals worldwide.
OBSERVATIONS: Bipolar disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of 
depression and mania or hypomania. Bipolar depressive episodes are similar to 
major depressive episodes. Manic and hypomanic episodes are characterized by a 
distinct change in mood and behavior during discrete time periods. The age of 
onset is usually between 15 and 25 years, and depression is the most frequent 
initial presentation. Approximately 75% of symptomatic time consists of 
depressive episodes or symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment are associated 
with a more favorable prognosis. Diagnosis and optimal treatment are often 
delayed by a mean of approximately 9 years following an initial depressive 
episode. Long-term treatment consists of mood stabilizers, such as lithium, 
valproate, and lamotrigine. Antipsychotic agents, such as quetiapine, 
aripiprazole, asenapine, lurasidone, and cariprazine, are recommended, but some 
are associated with weight gain. Antidepressants are not recommended as 
monotherapy. More than 50% of patients with bipolar disorder are not adherent to 
treatment. Life expectancy is reduced by approximately 12 to 14 years in people 
with bipolar disorder, with a 1.6-fold to 2-fold increase in cardiovascular 
mortality occurring a mean of 17 years earlier compared with the general 
population. Prevalence rates of metabolic syndrome (37%), obesity (21%), 
cigarette smoking (45%), and type 2 diabetes (14%) are higher among people with 
bipolar disorder, contributing to the risk of early mortality. The annual 
suicide rate is approximately 0.9% among individuals with bipolar disorder, 
compared with 0.014% in the general population. Approximately 15% to 20% of 
people with bipolar disorder die by suicide.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder affects approximately 8 million 
adults in the US. First-line therapy includes mood stabilizers, such as lithium, 
anticonvulsants, such as valproate and lamotrigine, and atypical antipsychotic 
drugs, such as quetiapine, aripiprazole, asenapine, lurasidone, and cariprazine.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As TAVR is increasingly performed on younger patients with a 
longer life expectancy, the number of redo-TAVR procedures is likely to increase 
in the coming years. Limited data is currently available on this sometimes 
challenging procedure. We provide a summary of currently published literature on 
management of patients with a failed transcatheter aortic valve.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent registry data have increased the clinical knowledge on 
redo-TAVR. Additionally, numerous bench studies have provided valuable insights 
into the technical aspects of redo-TAVR with various combinations of valve 
types. Redo-TAVR can be performed safely in selected cases with a high 
procedural success and good short-term outcomes. However, at present, the 
procedure remains relatively infrequent and many patients are not eligible. 
Bench testing can be useful to understand important concepts such as valve 
expansion, neoskirt, leaflet overhang, and leaflet deflection as well as their 
potential clinical implications.

INTRODUCTION: With the expanding indications of transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR) to younger and low-risk patients, the life expectancy of 
patients currently undergoing TAVR will likely outlive the durability of 
transcatheter bioprosthesis. Consequently, the number of failed transcatheter 
bioprosthesis requiring surgical valve explant or redo TAVR is expected to 
increase.
AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of redo 
TAVR for treating degenerated transcatheter bioprosthesis, focusing on 
pre-procedural planning, potential challenges of coronary reaccess during 
TAVR-in-TAVR and main outcomes of TAVR explant and redo TAVR.
EXPERT OPINION: Patient-tailored device selection and individualized 
implantation height should be carefully assessed during the index TAVR procedure 
(weighting between pacemaker avoidance and the potential risk of coronary 
occlusion in future TAVR-in-TAVR). Future prospective studies comparing safety 
and clinical outcomes between redo TAVR vs TAVR explant are eagerly awaited.

Aging is a complex physiological process encompassing both physical and 
cognitive decline over time. This intricate process is governed by a multitude 
of hallmarks and pathways, which collectively contribute to the emergence of 
numerous age-related diseases. In response to the remarkable increase in human 
life expectancy, there has been a substantial rise in research focusing on the 
development of anti-aging therapies and pharmacological interventions. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction, a critical factor in the aging process, significantly 
impacts overall cellular health. In this extensive review, we will explore the 
contemporary landscape of anti-aging strategies, placing particular emphasis on 
the promising potential of mitotherapy as a ground-breaking approach to 
counteract the aging process. Moreover, we will investigate the successful 
application of mitochondrial transplantation in both animal models and clinical 
trials, emphasizing its translational potential. Finally, we will discuss the 
inherent challenges and future possibilities of mitotherapy within the realm of 
aging research and intervention.

The second ASCL conference was held in February 2020, about 1 month after the 
first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was documented in the United 
States and before evidence of community spread. Since then, COVID-19 has become 
a global pandemic that has disproportionately infected, hospitalized, and killed 
ethnic and racial minorities in the United States (Jacobson et al., Am J Prev 
Med 61(5):644–651, 2021; Moore et al., MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 69:1122–1126, 
2020; Shiels et al., Ann Intern Med. https://doi.org/10.7326/m21-2134, 2021; 
American Cancer Society, Cancer facts & figures 2021. American Cancer Society, 
Atlanta, 2021). According to a report of provisional life expectancy estimates 
from the National Center for Health Statistics, the life expectancy for US 
Hispanics decreased 3 years (81.8–78.8) between 2019 and 2020. As a result, the 
life expectancy advantage held by Hispanics over non-Hispanic whites narrowed by 
60%, suggesting poorer health and mortality outcomes for the US Hispanic 
population. It is estimated that 90% of this decline in the life expectancy gap 
is the result of mortality caused by COVID-19 (Arias et al., Provisional life 
expectancy estimates for 2020. National Center for Health Statistics, 
Hyattsville, 2021). Some speculate that this disease disparity exists because 
Hispanics and other underrepresented groups receive the greatest exposure to the 
virus. They are more likely to live in densely populated areas and 
multigenerational households; use public transportation; and have essential 
public-facing jobs in the service and healthcare sectors, where working from 
home is not an option (American Cancer Society, Cancer facts & figures 2021. 
American Cancer Society, Atlanta, 2021; Hooper et al., JAMA 323(24):2466–2467, 
2020; Balogun et al., JAMA Oncol 6(10):1531–1532, 2020). If infected, they are 
also more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 because of 
comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and 
other chronic conditions (Hooper et al., JAMA 323(24):2466–2467, 2020).

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: There is controversy about the optimal 
revascularization strategy in severe coronary artery disease (CAD), including 
left main disease and/or multivessel disease. Several meta-analyses have 
analyzed the results at 5-year follow-up but there are no results after the 
fifth year. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized 
clinical trials, comparing results after the fifth year, between coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using 
drug-eluting stents in patients with severe CAD.
METHODS: We analyzed all clinical trials between January 2010 and January 2023. 
The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The databases of the original 
articles were reconstructed from Kaplan-Meier curves, simulating an 
individual-level meta-analysis. Comparisons were made at certain cutoff points 
(5 and 10 years). The 10-year restricted median survival time difference between 
CABG and PCI was calculated. The random effects model and the DerSimonian-Laird 
method were applied.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 5180 patients. During the 10-year follow-up, 
PCI showed a higher overall incidence of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.19; 95%CI, 
1.04-1.32; P=.008)]. PCI showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality within 
5 years (HR, 1.2; 95%CI, 1.06-1.53; P=.008), while no differences in the 
5-10-year period were revealed (HR, 1.03; 95%CI, 0.84-1.26; P=.76). Life 
expectancy of CABG patients was slightly higher than that of PCI patients (2.4 
months more).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe CAD, including left main disease and/or 
multivessel disease, there was higher a incidence of all-cause mortality after 
PCI compared with CABG at 10 years of follow-up. Specifically, PCI has higher 
mortality during the first 5 years and comparable risk beyond 5 years.

The tremendous rate with which data is generated and analysis methods emerge 
makes it increasingly difficult to keep track of their domain of applicability, 
assumptions, limitations, and consequently, of the efficacy and precision with 
which they solve specific tasks. Therefore, there is an increasing need for 
benchmarks, and for the provision of infrastructure for continuous method 
evaluation. APAeval is an international community effort, organized by the RNA 
Society in 2021, to benchmark tools for the identification and quantification of 
the usage of alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites from short-read, bulk 
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Here, we reviewed 17 tools and benchmarked eight 
on their ability to perform APA identification and quantification, using a 
comprehensive set of RNA-seq experiments comprising real, synthetic, and matched 
3'-end sequencing data. To support continuous benchmarking, we have incorporated 
the results into the OpenEBench online platform, which allows for continuous 
extension of the set of methods, metrics, and challenges. We envisage that our 
analyses will assist researchers in selecting the appropriate tools for their 
studies, while the containers and reproducible workflows could easily be 
deployed and extended to evaluate new methods or data sets.

Understanding orchard floor management is critical to organic tree-fruit 
production systems given its impact on weeds, soil fertility, tree health, and 
crop yield. Several viable options are available to producers for weed 
management and promotion of organic fertility, including use of turf and 
broadleaf alleyway covers and living and nonliving tree-row mulches. While these 
measures can be effective, little is known about how these strategies influence 
arthropod pests, which cause fruit injury. Here, we assessed 6 organic orchard 
floor management strategies for their impact on arthropod abundance and 
diversity in an organic peach production system in northern Utah from 2010 to 
2014, using sweep netting and pitfall collections along with observed peach 
fruit damage. Generally, we found that alleyway and tree-row treatments had no 
impact on total arthropod diversity, species richness, or community diversity. 
However, earwig (Forficula auricularia) abundance was significantly impacted by 
alleyway and tree-row treatments that resulted in increased fruit injury. 
Trefoil alleyway treatments consistently increased earwig abundance across 
life-history stages, while mulch or Alyssum (straw) tree-row treatments harbored 
more earwigs and, as a result, increased earwig fruit injury. Since earwigs are 
especially prone to damaging young, developing fruits, it is imperative that 
more work is done to assess earwig abundances and life-history traits. Our 
results demonstrate that detrimental arthropods are sensitive to orchard floor 
management and can further inform integrated pest management approaches that 
complement sustainability goals.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is expected to rise due to 
increased survivorship and life expectancy of patients with acute heart 
conditions. Patients with HF and other multiple comorbid conditions are likely 
to have poor health outcomes. This study aimed to assimilate the current body of 
knowledge and to provide the pooled effect of HF patients' comorbid conditions 
on health outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL 
databases. Observational studies evaluating the relationship between comorbid 
conditions and the health outcomes of HF were included. The pooled effect sizes 
of comorbidity on the identified health outcomes were calculated using a random 
effects model, and the heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 statistics.
RESULTS: A total of 42 studies were included in this review, and a meta-analysis 
was performed using the results of 39 studies. In the pooled analysis, the 
presence of a comorbid condition showed a significant pooled effect size in 
relation to the prognostic health outcomes: all-cause mortality (HR 1.31; 95% CI 
1.18, 1.45), all-cause readmission (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.09, 1.23), HF-related 
readmission (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.05, 1.23), and non-HF-related readmission (HR 
1.17; 95% CI 1.07, 1.27). Also, comorbidity was significantly associated with 
health-related quality of life and self-care confidence. Furthermore, we 
identified a total of 32 comorbid conditions from included studies. From these, 
16 individual conditions were included in the meta-analyses, and we identified 
10 comorbid conditions to have negative effects on overall prognostic outcomes: 
DM (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11, 1.22), COPD (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.23, 1.39), CKD (HR 
1.18, 95% CI 1.14, 1.23, stroke (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.17, 1.31), IHD (HR 1.17, 95% 
CI 1.11, 1.23), anemia (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14, 1.78), cancer (HR 1.17, 95% CI 
1.04, 1.32), atrial fibrillation (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01, 1.54), dementia (HR 
1.19, 95% CI 1.03, 1.36) and depression (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04, 1.31).
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid conditions have significantly negative pooled effects on 
HF patient health outcomes, especially in regard to the prognostic health 
outcomes. Clinicians should carefully identify and manage these conditions when 
implementing HF interventions to improve prognostic outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The improvement of flexion contracture is important in knee 
arthroplasty since residual flexion contracture postoperatively is associated 
with decreased quality of life and patient satisfaction. In this study, we 
investigated the effect of bi-cruciate stabilized (BCS)-type total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) as compared to posterior stabilized (PS)-type TKA on 
osteoarthritic primary knees with flexion contractures.
METHODS: 59 TKAs from January 2014 to December 2020, of which 30 were PS-type 
TKAs (NexGen LPS-flexⓇ; 76.3 years, BMI 27.5) and 29 BCS-type TKAs (Journey IIⓇ; 
72.5 years, BMI 28.6), were performed for knee osteoarthritis with preoperative 
flexion contracture of 15° or greater. Full extension was obtained 
intraoperatively during all TKAs. Clinical outcomes, radiological evaluations, 
and the amount of additional distal femoral osteotomy during TKA were evaluated 
in a retrospective study design.
RESULTS: The range of motion improved in the both groups. Postoperative flexion 
contracture was significantly improved in the BCS group. Knee Society Score 
improved significantly in both groups, with no difference between the two 
groups. The amount of additional distal femoral osteotomy was 2.5 ± 1.3 mm for 
the PS group, and 1.8 ± 1.5 mm for the BCS group, showing a significant 
difference (p = 0.04).
DISCUSSION: The BCS-type TKA significantly improved preoperative flexion 
contracture and reduced the amount of additional distal femoral osteotomy 
compared to PS-type TKA. This is attributed to the anterior cam in the BCS-type 
TKA, which leads to a smaller amount of protrusion of the posterior femoral 
condyle from the posterior margin of the tibial component in the BCS-type in 
knee extension, as compared to the PS-type.

Globally, both cancer incidence and survival are increasing. Early cancer 
detection and improved treatment means many people with cancer will survive for 
ten or more years following diagnosis. Multimorbidity, defined as two or more 
chronic conditions, is up to three times higher in people living with and beyond 
cancer (LWBC) compared to the general population. This scoping review summarises 
the research evidence on the association between cancer and multimorbidity in 
people LWBC. It explores five key domains in people LWBC: 1) prevalence of 
multimorbidity, 2) association between ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES) 
and multimorbidity, 3) association between health status and multimorbidity, 4) 
adverse health consequences of cancer and related treatments, and 5) whether 
being a cancer survivor impacts treatment received for multimorbidity. It 
focuses on ten common cancers with high survival rates: prostate, breast, 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, bowel/colorectal, kidney, head and neck, bladder, 
leukaemia, uterine and myeloma. A search of Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PsychINFO 
and Web of Science databases identified 9,460 articles, 115 of which met the 
inclusion criteria. Articles were included in the review that involved 
multimorbidity in adult cancer patients. An evaluation of the evidence was 
performed, and a summary of findings was generated according to Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for 
Scoping Reviews guidelines. This review included work from 20 countries, most 
studies were from the US (44%). The results showed that the most common 
long-term conditions in people LWBC were: hypertension, heart conditions, 
depression, COPD, and diabetes. The most reported incident comorbidities after a 
cancer diagnosis were congestive heart failure, chronic pain, and chronic 
fatigue. Multimorbidity tended to be higher amongst people LWBC from ethnic 
minority groups and those with lower SES. Quality of life was poorer in people 
LWBC with multimorbidity. The review identified the need for a uniform approach 
to measure multimorbidity in cancer patients across the world. Further research 
is required to compare multimorbidity before and after a cancer diagnosis, to 
explore the association of multimorbidity with ethnicity and socio-economic 
status and to determine whether a cancer diagnosis impacts care received for 
multimorbidity in people LWBC.

OBJECTIVES: Discussing end-of-life (EOL) issues with patients remains 
challenging for health professionals. Physicians may use various expressions, 
including euphemistic ones, when disclosing the prognosis to their patients to 
reduce their psychological impact. However, the actual expressions of EOL 
disclosure in clinical practice are unclear. This study aims to investigate the 
expressions used in EOL disclosures and explore their associated factors.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted enrolling all the patients 
who died in a university-affiliated hospital. Expressions used in the EOL 
disclosure were qualitatively analyzed. The patients' participation rate and 
length from the discussion to death were investigated.
RESULTS: EOL disclosures were observed in 341 of 358 patients. The expressions 
used by the physicians were categorized into 4 groups; Group 1: Clear 
presentation of life expectancy (n = 106; 31.1%), Group 2: Euphemistic 
presentation of life expectancy (n = 24; 7.0%), Group 3: Presentation of risk of 
sudden death (n = 147; 43.1%), Group 4: No mention on life expectancy (n = 64; 
18.8%). The proportion of male patients was higher in Group 2 (79%) and lower in 
Group 4 (56%). Patients with cancer accounted for approximately 70% of Groups 1 
and 4, but only approximately 30% of Group 3. The patient participation rate was
