Publisher: Introdução: Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o impacto da 
pandemia COVID-19 no internato de Formação Específica de Oftalmologia em 
Portugal. Material e Métodos: Estudo descritivo dos resultados obtidos de um 
questionário aplicado a todos os internos de Formação Específica de Oftalmologia 
em Portugal (n = 80). Resultados: Setenta e cinco internos participaram no 
estudo (taxa de resposta de 94%). Excetuando um caso, todos (99%) admitiram 
alteração da sua prática clínica durante a pandemia, e a maioria (89%) manteve 
atividades clínicas no seu serviço de Oftalmologia. Vinte e cinco porcento foram 
integrados em unidades COVID-19, e metade desses inquiridos (47%) desempenharam 
concomitantemente atividades no âmbito da oftalmologia. Uma percentagem 
significativa dos inquiridos referiu estar envolvido nas seguintes atividades 
clínicas oftalmológicas: serviço de Urgência/consultas internas (87%), consultas 
externas (73%: geral 70% vs subespecialidade 29%), e cirurgias (64%). Vinte e 
cinco porcento não participaram em consultas externas, e 36% em procedimentos 
cirúrgicos. Numa escala de 1 (sem impacto) a 5 (máximo impacto), a maioria dos 
inquiridos classificou o impacto percecionado da pandemia no internato de 
Formação Específica de Oftalmologia em 3 (34%), 4 (40%) e 5 (27%). Oitenta 
porcento dos inquiridos enumerou a extensão do período do internato de Formação 
Específica como uma medida a adotar para minimizar o impacto negativo da 
pandemia. Discussão: A maioria dos internos mantiveram-se a desempenhar 
atividades clínicas no seu serviço de Oftalmologia, principalmente no âmbito da 
oftalmologia geral e de urgência. O desempenho de atividade cirúrgica foi 
largamente afetado. São necessárias estratégias adaptativas para garantir a 
continuação adequada da formação dos internos. Futuros estudos noutros contextos 
geográficos permitirão perceber de que forma os programas de formação em 
oftalmologia estão a ser afetados ao nível internacional, para que as 
organizações educacionais possam elaborar recomendações. Conclusão: A pandemia 
COVID-19 teve um impacto significativo no internato de Formação Específica de 
Oftalmologia em Portugal.

BACKGROUND: In the WRAP-IT trial (Worldwide Randomized Antibiotic Envelope 
Infection Prevention), adjunctive use of an absorbable antibacterial envelope 
resulted in a 40% reduction of major cardiac implantable electronic device 
infection without increased risk of complication in 6983 patients undergoing 
cardiac implantable electronic device revision, replacement, upgrade, or initial 
cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator implant. There is limited 
information on the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. As a prespecified 
objective, we evaluated antibacterial envelope cost-effectiveness compared with 
standard-of-care infection prevention strategies in the US healthcare system.
METHODS: A decision tree model was used to compare costs and outcomes of 
antibacterial envelope (TYRX) use adjunctive to standard-of-care infection 
prevention versus standard-of-care alone over a lifelong time horizon. The 
analysis was performed from an integrated payer-provider network perspective. 
Infection rates, antibacterial envelope effectiveness, infection treatment costs 
and patterns, infection-related mortality, and utility estimates were obtained 
from the WRAP-IT trial. Life expectancy and long-term costs associated with 
device replacement, follow-up, and healthcare utilization were sourced from the 
literature. Costs and quality-adjusted life years were discounted at 3%. An 
upper willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per quality-adjusted life year 
was used to determine cost-effectiveness, in alignment with the American College 
of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines and as supported by 
the World Health Organization and contemporary literature.
RESULTS: The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the antibacterial 
envelope compared with standard-of-care was $112 603/quality-adjusted life year. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio remained lower than the 
willingness-to-pay threshold in 74% of iterations in the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis and was most sensitive to the following model inputs: 
infection-related mortality, life expectancy, and infection cost.
CONCLUSIONS: The absorbable antibacterial envelope was associated with a 
cost-effectiveness ratio below contemporary benchmarks in the WRAP-IT patient 
population, suggesting that the envelope provides value for the US healthcare 
system by reducing the incidence of cardiac implantable electronic device 
infection. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier:

IMPORTANCE: Life expectancy has decreased in the US, driven largely by increases 
in drug poisoning, suicide, and alcohol-induced deaths. Assessing whether 
patterns of these causes differ is required to inform public health 
interventions.
OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns and trends in drug poisoning, suicide, and 
alcohol-induced death rates by geography and demographic characteristics.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This serial cross-sectional study used 
national vital statistics data from the entire US population from January 1, 
2000, to December 31, 2017, among US residents aged 20 to 64 years. Data were 
analyzed from January through August 2019.
EXPOSURES: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, county-level percentage of unemployment, 
rurality, and geography.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Deaths were categorized as due to drug poisoning, 
suicide, or alcohol-induced causes based on underlying cause of death. 
Age-standardized incidence rates and annual percentage changes (APCs) in rates 
were estimated. Clusters of high-rate counties were identified with hot spot 
analysis. Excess deaths during 2001 to 2017 were estimated for each cause as the 
difference between the number of deaths observed and expected if rates had 
remained stable starting in 2000.
RESULTS: During 2000 to 2017, 1 446 177 drug poisoning, suicide, and 
alcohol-induced premature deaths occurred in the US, including 563 765 drug 
poisoning deaths (age-standardized rate: 17.6 per 100 000 person-years [PYs]), 
517 679 suicides (age-standardized rate: 15.8 per 100 000 PYs), and 364 733 
alcohol-induced deaths (age-standardized rate: 10.5 per 100 000 PYs), totaling 
451 596 more deaths than expected based on 2000 rates. High drug poisoning death 
rates were clustered in the Northeast through Appalachia, yet rates of suicide 
and alcohol-induced deaths were highest in the West. Only suicide death rates 
were highest in rural areas. Drug poisoning death rates were highest among 
people aged 35 to 49 years (age-standardized rate: 23.7 per 100 000 PYs), 
whereas suicide and alcohol-induced death rates peaked among people aged 50 to 
64 years (suicide age-standardized rate: 19.6 per 100 000 PYs; alcohol-induced 
age-standardized death rate: 26.8 per 100 000 PYs). Increases occurred over time 
across racial/ethnic groups, although trajectories and inflection years varied. 
Drug poisoning (2013-2017 APC, 15.0% [95% CI, 11-8%-18.3%] per year) and 
alcohol-induced death rates (2012-2017 APC, 4.1% [95% CI, 3.3%-4.9%] per year) 
have accelerated recently, while increases in suicide death rates have largely 
increased at a constant trajectory (2000-2017 APC, 1.8% [95% CI, 1.7%-1.9%] per 
year).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found that demographic 
characteristics and geographic patterns varied by cause of death, suggesting 
that increasing death rates from these causes were not concentrated in 1 group 
or region. Specialized interventions tailored for the underlying drivers of each 
cause of death are urgently needed.

OBJECTIVE: Given the reported increased rates of physical morbidity and higher 
mortality rates among people with severe mental illness (SMI) (schizophrenia and 
severe mood disorders), with a life expectancy shorter of 15-20 years with 
respect to the general population, the aim of this paper was to call attention 
to the problem of cancer in SMI.
METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the most significant papers 
published in the areas of cancer screening, incidence, mortality and palliative 
care in SMI.
RESULTS: Data from the literature confirm disparities in screening (eg, 
mammography; pap-smear test; colorectal cancer screening) and prevention (eg, 
clinical breast examination; smoking cessation). The incidence of cancer was 
found to be variable with a portion of the studies reporting a higher prevalence 
while others a similar or a lower prevalence of cancer compared to the general 
population. A lower percentage of patients with SMI received proper cancer 
treatment resulting in survival after cancer diagnosis significantly worse than 
people without SMI. Likewise, end-of-life care has been shown to be lacking with 
poorer levels of physical, psychological and spiritual care.
CONCLUSIONS: The problems of stigma and discrimination, poorer dignity, poorer 
health behavior, lack of integration in health-care services for people with SMI 
needs to be addressed and solved in cancer care. Psycho-oncology has a very 
specific and mandatory role in integrating the recommendation of the World 
Health Organization to improve the links between oncology and mental health 
settings for more specific psycho-oncology programs addressed for this 
vulnerable segment of the population.

across a set of barley cultivars: The importance of plant defense versus 
cannibalism.

Accurately estimating cause-specific mortality for immature insect herbivores is 
usually difficult. The insects are exposed to abiotic and biotic mortality 
factors, causing cadavers to simply disappear before cause of mortality can be 
recorded. Also, insect herbivores are often highly mobile on hosts, making it 
difficult to follow patterns for individuals through time. In contrast, the 
wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, spends its entire egg, larval, and 
pupal period inside a host stem. Therefore, with periodic sampling 
stage-specific causes of mortality can be ascertained. Consequently, we examined 
C. cinctus mortality in eight barley, Hordeum vulgare L., cultivars in two 
locations in Montana from 2016 to 2018 by collecting stem samples from stem 
elongation to crop maturity at weekly intervals, and collecting overwintered 
barley stubs the following spring and summer from the same plots. If larvae were 
present, we examined larval status-dead or alive-and categorized dead 
individuals into one of 5 mortality categories: plant defense, cannibalism, 
parasitism, pathogens, and unknown factors. We used multiple decrement life 
tables to estimate cause-specific mortality and irreplaceable mortality (the 
proportion of mortality from a given cause that cannot be replaced by other 
causes of mortality). Plant defense (antibiosis) caused 85.7 ± 3.6%, cannibalism 
(governed by antixenosis) caused 70.1 ± 7.6%, parasitism caused 13.8 ± 5.9%, 
unknown factors caused 38.5 ± 7.6%, and pathogens caused 14.7 ± 8.5% mortality 
in the presence of all causes of mortality. Similarly, irreplaceable mortality 
due to plant defense was 22.3 ± 6.4%, cannibalism was 29.1± 4.2%, unknown 
factors was 6.2 ± 1.8%, pathogens was 0.9 ± 0.5%, and parasitism was 1. 5 ± 0. 
6%. Antibiosis traits primarily killed newly emerged larvae, while other traits 
supported more favorable oviposition decisions by females, increasing mortality 
by obligate cannibalism. Our results suggest that breeding barley for resistance 
to C. cinctus targeting both categories of traits (antibiosis and antixenosis) 
is a highly valuable tactic for management of this important pest.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of multimorbidity and investigate the 
socioeconomic factors that are associated with multimorbidity among persons 70 
years and older in Trinidad and Tobago.
DESIGN AND METHODS: The data were obtained from a nationally representative 
comprehensive cross-sectional survey conducted in 2014 among elderly persons in 
the targeted age group. The prevalence of multimorbidity among the elderly 
population was estimated. A logit model was utilized to determine the 
socioeconomic characteristics that are associated with multimorbidity in the 
elderly.
RESULTS: The results of the study show that multimorbidity in the elderly 
population is strongly associated with age, ethnicity, lower education, smoking 
history, no physical activity and being female. An interesting finding is that 
elderly persons in the richest quintile are in general, more prone to 
multimorbidity.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that interventions to reduce multimorbidity 
among the elderly population must encourage greater levels of physical activity, 
provide education on the risk factors of multimorbidity, and discourage smoking.

BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is frequent in intensive care unit (ICU) patients 
and may be associated with adverse outcomes. We aimed to assess the incidence, 
risk factors, and outcomes associated with thrombocytopenia in adult ICU 
patients.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development 
and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We included study reports on adult ICU patients 
with thrombocytopenia and assessed patient-important outcomes, including 
mortality and health-related quality-of-life.
RESULTS: We included a total of 70 studies comprising a total of 215 098 
patients; 57 were cohort studies. The incidence of thrombocytopenia varied from 
8 to 56 per 100 admissions (very low quality of evidence). We identified several 
risk factors including age, sepsis, and higher disease severity (low quality of 
evidence). Thrombocytopenia was associated with bleeding, use of life support, 
length of stay in the ICU, and increased mortality (low/very low quality of 
evidence). Data on platelet transfusion before invasive procedures and 
transfusion thresholds were limited. No studies assessed the benefits and harms 
of thromboprophylaxis in ICU patients with thrombocytopenia.
CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia is common and associated with increased morbidity 
and mortality in adult ICU patients. Several risk factors for thrombocytopenia 
exists, but the evidence-base on management strategies, including transfusion 
thresholds and thromboprophylaxis in ICU patients is very limited.

In this work, the increase of the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) lifespan 
extension using hyper-branched cyclodextrin-based nanosponges (CD-NS) complexing 
oxyresveratrol (OXY), and the possible inhibition of C. elegans 
phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) were evaluated. The titration displacement of 
fluorescein was used to calculate the apparent complexation constant (KF) 
between CD-NS and OXY. Moreover, PDE4 was expressed in E. coli, purified and 
refolded in presence of cyclodextrins (CDs) to study its possible inhibition as 
pharmacological target of OXY. The apparent activity was characterized and the 
inhibitory effect of OXY on PDE4 displayed a competitive in vitro inhibition 
corroborated in silico. A maximum increase of the in vivo life expectancy of 
about 9.6% of using OXY/CD-NS complexes in comparison with the control was 
obtained, in contrast to the 6.5% obtained with free OXY. No effect on lifespan 
or toxicity with CD-NS alone was found. These results as a whole represent new 
opportunities to use OXY and CD-NS in lifespan products.

BACKGROUND: Most pancreatic cancer patients present with advanced stage at 
diagnosis with extremely short expected survival and few treatment options. A 
multimodal palliative approach is necessary for symptom relief and optimisation 
of health-related quality of life. In a recent open-label trial of mistletoe 
extract for advanced pancreatic cancer patients not eligible for chemotherapy, 
promising results on improved overall survival and better health-related quality 
of life were reported. The objective of the present study is to assess the value 
of mistletoe extract as a complement to standard treatment (palliative 
chemotherapy or best supportive care) in advanced pancreatic cancer patients 
with regard to overall survival and health-related quality of life.
METHODS: The trial is prospective, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 
parallel group and placebo-controlled. In total, 290 participants are randomly 
assigned to placebo or mistletoe extract given subcutaneously in increasing 
dosage from 0.01 to 20 mg three times per week for 9 months. Stratification is 
performed for site and palliative chemotherapy. Main inclusion criteria are 
advanced pancreatic cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
status 0 to 2; main exclusion criteria are life expectancy less than 4 weeks and 
neuroendocrine tumour of the pancreas. Two ancillary studies on sub-sets of 
participants are nested in the trial: a biomarker study collecting blood samples 
and a cross-sectional qualitative study with semi-structured face-to-face 
interviews.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first placebo-controlled randomised 
trial assessing the impact of mistletoe extract as a complement to standard 
treatment on overall survival and health-related quality of life in patients 
with advanced pancreatic cancer. The presented trial with its two nested 
ancillary studies exploring biomarkers and patient experiences is expected to 
give new insights into the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: Patients with HIV are more likely to require a total hip 
arthroplasty (THA) because of an increase in life expectancy and complications 
with HIV. The purpose of this study is to describe the mid-term outcomes of THA 
in HIV-positive patients and risk factors for postoperative infections and poor 
outcomes.
METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective review of nonhemophiliac 
HIV-positive patients who underwent THA. We reviewed the short- and mid-term 
readmission and complication rates.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients underwent 102 THAs. The average age was 58 years 
(24-73 years). The average body mass index was 31.6 (18-55). The average CD4+ 
count was 569 cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) (51-1480), and the mean viral 
load was <40 copies/mL (undetectable-380 000). The mean follow-up time was 6.7 
years (24 months- 8.3 years). Four patients had postoperative complications 
within 30 days. Seven patients had postoperative complications after 30 days; 5 
of which had septic loosening of implants and had either not been initiated on 
or were noncompliant with their highly active antiretroviral therapy. The 
average postoperative Harris Hip Score was 81 (41-100) and Oxford Hip Score was 
43.43 (34-48). There was no correlation the between CD4+ count and viral load 
with complications.
CONCLUSION: Low rate of complications and revision is achievable in the 
HIV-positive, nonhemophilic arthroplasty population contrary to published 
literature. An important factor ensuring good long-term outcomes in HIV-positive 
patients undergoing THA was the initiation of highly active antiretroviral 
therapy before the procedure and ensuring patient compliance with therapy after 
joint arthroplasty.

Neurological dysfunction represents a significant clinical component of many of 
the mucopolysaccharidoses (also known as MPS disorders). The accurate and 
consistent assessment of neuropsychological function is essential to gain a 
greater understanding of the precise natural history of these conditions and to 
design effective clinical trials to evaluate the impact of therapies on the 
brain. In 2017, an International MPS Consensus Panel published recommendations 
for best practice in the design and conduct of clinical studies investigating 
the effects of therapies on cognitive function and adaptive behavior in patients 
with neuronopathic mucopolysaccharidoses. Based on an International MPS 
Consensus Conference held in February 2020, this article provides updated 
consensus recommendations and expands the objectives to include approaches for 
assessing behavioral and social-emotional state, caregiver burden and quality of 
life in patients with all mucopolysaccharidoses.

In developed countries, it is projected that there will be a 70% increase in the 
number of adults living with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) between 2010 and 2025. This 
shift in demographics highlights the importance of high-quality transition 
programmes with developmentally appropriate integrated health care services as 
the individual moves through adolescence to adulthood. Adolescents living with 
CF face additional and unique challenges that may have long-term impacts on 
their health, quality of life and life-expectancy. CF specific issues around 
socially challenging symptoms, body image, reproductive health and treatment 
burden differentiate people with CF from their peers and require clinicians to 
identify and address these issues during the transition process. This review 
provides an overview of the health, developmental and psychosocial challenges 
faced by individuals with CF, their guardians and health care teams considering 
the fundamental components and tools that are required to build a transition 
programme that can be tailored to suit individual CF clinics.

BACKGROUND: Elderly women (≥ 70 years old) form a significant proportion of 
patients affected by breast cancer (BC); however, the treatment decisions for 
this patient population are complicated, owing to the presence of comorbidities, 
limited life expectancy, reduced tolerability of therapy, and limited enrollment 
in clinical trials. A growing body of evidence suggests equivalent outcomes in 
elderly patients with hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer 
receiving primary endocrine therapy only or surgery with subsequent endocrine 
therapy. Whether these results are reproduced in the larger BC population 
outside of a clinical trial currently remains unclear.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women ≥ 70 years old diagnosed with early-stage invasive 
breast cancer between January 2008 and December 2013 with tumor size T1 or T2, 
minimal nodal involvement (N0 and N1), and estrogen and/or progesterone receptor 
positivity who started endocrine therapy within a year of diagnosis were 
identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare 
linked datasets. Endocrine therapy was identified using outpatient prescription 
fills for anastrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, letrozole, raloxifene, 
tamoxifen, and toremifene; the first fill date was used as the treatment 
initiation date. Surgical intervention included either breast-conserving surgery 
or mastectomy. Women who received chemotherapy were excluded. Trends in the use 
of primary endocrine therapy only were assessed using Poisson regression. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the 
association between undergoing surgery within a year of diagnosis and 5-year 
all-cause mortality, after adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities, 
and clinical cancer characteristics. Similar methods were used to assess 5-year 
cancer-specific mortality, where noncancer mortality was treated as a competing 
risk.
RESULTS: Overall, 8784 women were included in the analysis: 8006 (91%) received 
surgery with endocrine therapy and 778 (9%) received primary endocrine therapy 
alone. The proportion of women not receiving surgery remained consistent between 
2008 and 2013 (p = 0.10). The 5-year mortality was 11% (n = 619), and 19% of all 
deaths were due to cancer causes (n = 117). After adjustment, 5-year mortality 
was lower among women undergoing surgery (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74, 
p < 0.0001). Similar results were found when looking at 5-year cancer-specific 
mortality (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.90, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly breast cancer patients with early-stage 
hormone-receptor-positive disease receiving primary surgical intervention plus 
endocrine therapy may have significantly improved survival than those receiving 
primary endocrine therapy alone. This study suggests the importance of surgical 
intervention for elderly breast cancer patients and warrants further 
investigation and comprehensive geriatric assessment to identify subsets of 
elderly breast cancer patients who may benefit significantly from surgical 
intervention.

Blurred time resolution of tooth dentin serial sections.

Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan.

OBJECTIVES: The growth of tooth dentin is incremental, so its formation 
represents a dietary record in early life. With archeological skeletons, 
applying sequential stable isotope analysis to the horizontal sections of tooth 
dentin has revealed weaning patterns and dietary changes that took place during 
childhood. However, the assignment of ages to dentin serial sections (DSSs) is 
problematic due to the changing extension rate and oblique growth layers of 
dentin, and these effects have not been quantified. This study presents a 
mathematical model for investigating the corresponding age range of the 
horizontal DSSs of human permanent incisors, canines, and molars.
METHODS: Parameters describing the tooth dentin microstructure were taken from 
previous studies, and dentin growth patterns were modeled. The model was 
implemented as the R package MDSS.
RESULTS: The developed model shows that the true corresponding age of the 
sections differed by a few years on average from the estimated age with equal 
temporal divisions, that the model gave values extending across a wide range, 
and that these differences become large for sections formed at older ages. The 
stable isotope ratio of the sections presented an aggregate representation of 
possibly complex dietary changes across a few years, and dietary changes over 
short times, such as several months, could not be accurately reconstructed even 
when using a finer horizontal sectioning method.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that DSSs correspond to an unexpectedly 
wider (i.e., three to four times) and different (i.e., -2 to 0.5 years on 
average) age range than previously assumed and that complicated patterns of 
dietary change blur in the isotopic trajectory of the sections. Alternative 
experimental methods, such as imaging-assisted oblique sampling, should be used 
to retrieve an accurate and precise sequential dietary record from tooth dentin.

BACKGROUND: The data from the phase III clinical trial KEYNOTE-426 indicated 
that pembrolizumab plus axitinib compared with sunitinib could generate clinical 
benefits in patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC). Given the incremental clinical benefits, we examined the potential 
cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib in the 
first-line setting for patients with advanced RCC from the U.S. payers' 
perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost and health outcomes were estimated at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 to $150,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed 
by varying potentially modifiable parameters, and additional subgroup analyses 
were performed as well.
RESULTS: Upon our analyses, the total treatment costs in the pembrolizumab plus 
axitinib and sunitinib groups were $522,796 and $348,424 and the QALYs gained 
2.90 and 1.72, respectively. In the base-case analysis, compared with receiving 
sunitinib, patients with advanced RCC receiving pembrolizumab plus axitinib 
gained 1.18 more QALYs at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$148,676/QALY. The results of subgroup analyses demonstrated that pembrolizumab 
plus axitinib was most cost-effective for patients who had one organ with 
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: First-line treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib, compared with 
sunitinib, is a cost-effective strategy when the value of WTP is from $100,000 
to $150,000 per QALY in patients with advanced RCC. For patients with one-organ 
metastasis and those in International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database 
Consortium poor risk group, first-line treatment with pembrolizumab plus 
axitinib is more cost-effective than others.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This was the first study to examine the 
cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib in advanced 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study found that first-line treatment with 
pembrolizumab plus axitinib is a cost-effective strategy when the value of 
willingness-to-pay is from $100,000 to $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
in patients with advanced RCC from the U.S. payers' perspective.

Individuals with severe psychiatric disorders have a reduced life expectancy 
compared to the general population. At the biological level, patients with these 
disorders present features that suggest the involvement of accelerated aging, 
such as increased circulating inflammatory markers and shorter telomere length 
(TL). To date, the role of the interplay between inflammation and telomere 
dynamics in the pathophysiology of severe psychiatric disorders has been 
scarcely investigated. In this study we measured T-lymphocytes TL with 
quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) and plasma levels of 
inflammatory markers in a cohort comprised of 40 patients with bipolar disorder 
(BD), 41 with schizophrenia (SZ), 37 with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 
36 non-psychiatric controls (NPC). TL was shorter in SZ and in MDD compared to 
NPC, while it was longer in BD (model F6, 137 = 20.128, p = 8.73 × 10-17, effect 
of diagnosis, F3 = 31.870; p = 1.08 × 10-15). There was no effect of the 
different classes of psychotropic medications, while duration of treatment with 
mood stabilizers was associated with longer TL (Partial correlation controlled 
for age and BMI: correlation coefficient = 0.451; p = 0.001). Levels of 
high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) were higher in SZ compared to NPC 
(adjusted p = 0.027), and inversely correlated with TL in the whole sample 
(r = -0.180; p = 0.042). Compared to NPC, patients with treatment resistant (TR) 
SZ had shorter TL (p = 0.001), while patients with TR MDD had higher levels of 
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) compared to NPC (p = 0.028) and to non-TR 
(p = 0.039). Comorbidity with cardio-metabolic disorders did not influence the 
observed differences in TL, hsCRP, and TNFα among the diagnostic groups. Our 
study suggests that patients with severe psychiatric disorders present reduced 
TL and increased inflammation.
