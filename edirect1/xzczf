RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were randomised to acupuncture or usual care. 
Acupuncture resulted in significant improvements in pain intensity (8- and 
14-week mean changes compared to usual care of -1.8 and -1.8, respectively), 
pain interference (8- and 14-week mean changes compared to usual care of -1.5 
and -0.9, respectively) and indicators of quality of life and 
neurotoxicity-related symptoms. However, in the economic evaluation there was 
little difference in QALYs between the two arms (mean change 0.209 and 0.200 in 
the acupuncture and usual care arms, respectively). Also, costs yielded 
deterministic ICERs of HK$616,965.62, HK$824,083.44 and HK$540,727.56 per QALY 
gained from the health care provider perspective, the societal perspective and 
the patient perspective, respectively. These costs are significantly higher than 
the cost-effectiveness threshold of HK$180,450 that was used for the base case 
analysis.
CONCLUSION: While acupuncture can improve symptoms and quality of life 
indicators related to CIPN, it is unlikely to be a cost-effective treatment for 
CIPN-related pain in health care systems with limited resources.

As the primary decomposers of organic material in terrestrial ecosystems, fungi 
are critical agents of the global carbon cycle. Yet our ability to link fungal 
community composition to ecosystem functioning is constrained by a limited 
understanding of the factors accounting for different wood decomposition rates 
among fungi. Here we examine which traits best explain fungal decomposition 
ability by combining detailed trait-based assays on 34 saprotrophic fungi from 
across North America in the laboratory with a 5-y field study comprising 1,582 
fungi isolated from 74 decomposing logs. Fungal growth rate (hyphal extension 
rate) was the strongest single predictor of fungal-mediated wood decomposition 
rate under laboratory conditions, and accounted for up to 27% of the in situ 
variation in decomposition in the field. At the individual level, decomposition 
rate was negatively correlated with moisture niche width (an indicator of 
drought stress tolerance) and with the production of nutrient-mineralizing 
extracellular enzymes. Together, these results suggest that decomposition rates 
strongly align with a dominance-tolerance life-history trade-off that was 
previously identified in these isolates, forming a spectrum from slow-growing, 
stress-tolerant fungi that are poor decomposers to fast-growing, highly 
competitive fungi with fast decomposition rates. Our study illustrates how an 
understanding of fungal trait variation could improve our predictive ability of 
the early and midstages of wood decay, to which our findings are most 
applicable. By mapping our results onto the biogeographic distribution of the 
dominance-tolerance trade-off across North America, we approximate broad-scale 
patterns in intrinsic fungal-mediated wood decomposition rates.

OBJECTIVE: To identify genes underlying childhood onset psychosis.
METHODS: Patients with onset of psychosis at age 13 or younger were identified 
from clinics across England, and they and their parents were exome sequenced and 
analysed for possible highly penetrant genetic contributors.
RESULTS: We report two male childhood onset psychosis patients of different 
ancestries carrying hemizygous very rare possibly damaging missense variants 
(p.Arg846His and p.Pro145Ser) in the L1CAM gene. L1CAM is an X-linked Mendelian 
disease gene in which both missense and loss of function variants are associated 
with syndromic forms of intellectual disability and developmental disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting a possible extension of the 
phenotype of L1CAM variant carriers to childhood onset psychosis. The family 
history and presence of other significant rare genetic variants in the patients 
suggest that there may be genetic interactions modulating the presentation.

Effects of the Continuous Care Model on the Health-Promoting Lifestyle in Breast 
Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Clinical Trial.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the chief cause of 
cancer-related death among women worldwide, with the incidence increasing 
exponentially particularly in low- to middle-income countries. The increase in 
the incidence of breast cancer is partly accounted for by increases in life 
expectancy due to improvements in public health, but also related to an increase 
in risk factors for cancer including smoking, excess body weight, decreased 
physical activity, and changes in reproductive activity. Health-promoting 
lifestyle is therefore one of the major topics of importance in studying chronic 
illnesses and cancer. Health promotion interventions, including the use of care 
models, have a vast contribution to make in terms of timely diagnosis and 
improved survival. One such care model, which has been designed to increase 
self-care, adherence, and performance in chronic patients, is the continuous 
care model (CCM). This study was conducted with the purpose of determining the 
influence of the CCM on the health-promoting lifestyle of patients with breast 
cancer during 2017-2018. In this randomized clinical trial, 60 patients with 
breast cancer were chosen by convenience sampling followed by random allocation 
into treatment and control groups. Six sessions of group discussion were held 
for the treatment group according to the CCM and items in the health-promoting 
lifestyle questionnaire. Data collection tools included a general health 
questionnaire, a demographic questionnaire, a family support questionnaire, and 
the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP), which respondents completed 
before and after the intervention. P values ≤ .05 were considered significant. 
When comparing the mean score of health-promoting lifestyle in both the control 
and treatment groups, before and after the intervention, significant increases 
in every dimension were observed. The average overall health promotion lifestyle 
was revealed to be significantly elevated from 123.48 to 147.12. However, in the 
control group the mean scores had slightly increased or were the same in all the 
dimensions. In addition, the average overall health promotion lifestyle had 
increased from 119.89 to 121.32. The observed difference in mean scores was not 
statistically significant. The CCM increased the score of health-promoting 
lifestyle of patients with breast cancer. Therefore, this caring model can be 
considered an alternative to improve healthy lifestyles of patients with cancer.

Smoking is one of the leading preventable threats to human health and a major 
risk factor for lung cancer, upper aero-digestive cancer, and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. Estimating and forecasting the smoking 
attributable fraction (SAF) of mortality can yield insights into smoking 
epidemics and also provide a basis for more accurate mortality and life 
expectancy projection. Peto et al. (1992) proposed a method to estimate the SAF 
using the lung cancer mortality rate as an indicator of exposure to smoking in 
the population of interest. Here we use the same method to estimate the all-age 
SAF (ASAF) for both genders for over 60 countries. We document a strong and 
cross-nationally consistent pattern of the evolution of the SAF over time. We 
use this as the basis for a new Bayesian hierarchical model to project future 
male and female ASAF from over 60 countries simultaneously. This gives forecasts 
as well as predictive distributions that can be used to find uncertainty 
intervals for any quantity of interest. We assess the model using out-of-sample 
predictive validation, and find that it provides good forecasts and well 
calibrated forecast intervals, comparing favorably with other methods.

It is well documented that life expectancy in developed countries at birth is 
going to surpass the 20th century. However, regrettably, a potential decline in 
life expectancy has been proposed for these nations in the 21st century due to a 
rapid upsurge in the prevalence of fatal degenerative diseases like 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancer and diabetes. Collectively, these three 
diseases accounted for 65% of all deaths in urbanized societies and were 
considered as a dynamic issue for shortening the genetically determined lifespan 
through increased mortalities, morbidities, disabilities, immense sufferings, 
and premature aging. These fatal degenerative diseases and premature aging are 
closely associated with oxidative stress produced by the free radicals in the 
body. In epidemiologic studies, flavonoid-rich foods (FRF) like fruits, 
vegetables, and beverages have been associated as protective agents against 
these diseases. These also have been observed for their geroprotective effects 
and help in preventing premature aging and deterioration of brain function, 
which is related to Alzheimer's disease and dementia. In this review, we 
presented a comprehensive overview of the FRF for their potential role against 
lifespan-shortening complications, i.e., CVD, cancer, and diabetes. We also have 
drawn the future perspective and dietary guidelines to reduce the fatal disease 
burden in urban populations.

Extension of the self-assembled bionanonetworks into surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR) assay investigation provides an effective signal amplification approach. 
We fabricated a bionetwork by nucleic acids, organic compounds, and 
supramolecular gold nanoparticles for ultrasensitive SPR detection of B-type 
natriuretic peptide (BNP). The SPR method was developed by a sandwich-type 
format of aptamer-target-antibody, and the aptamer-modified bionanonetworks 
induced localized SPR and large refractive index for different concentrations of 
the target BNP. The linear concentration range and limit of detection were 
1-10,000 pg/mL (R2 = 0.9852) and 0.3 pg/mL respectively. The detection recovery 
was in the range 92.13 to 108.69%. The approach embraces the following main 
advantages: (1) Cooperative double recognition was realized by calix[4]arenes 
for amino aptamers and pyridinium porphyrins. (2) The approach provided the 
specificity for supramolecular-based nanomaterials and a simple synthesis 
process via the ordered self-assembly under mild conditions. (3) The 
bionanonetworks endowed the SPR assay with signal amplification and stable 
determination for trace proteins. Therefore, it is expected that this study may 
offer a new SPR signal-amplified platform of organic-inorganic bionanonetworks 
to achieve sensitive, stable, and real-time determination. Graphical abstract 
Schematic of bionanonetwork based on porphyrin-mediated functionalized gold 
nanoparticles for SPR signal amplification to quantitatively detect BNP.

Delayed homing and engraftment of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) or 
even failure to engraft at all is significant clinical problem after 
hematopoietic transplant. Therefore, in order to develop more efficient homing 
and engraftment facilitating strategies it is important to learn more about this 
process. Our team has postulated that myeloablative conditioning for 
transplantation induces in bone marrow (BM) microenvironment a state of sterile 
inflammation in which elements of innate immunity activated by radio- or 
chemotherapy conditioning for transplant play an important role. In frame with 
this claim we reported that a significant role in this process plays activation 
of complement cascade (ComC). Accordingly, mice that that lack a fifth component 
(C5) of ComC turned out to engraft poorly with normal syngeneic BM cells as 
compared to normal control animals. In extension of our previous studies we 
provide for first time evidence that mannan binding lectin (MBL) pathway is 
involved in activation of ComC in myeloablated transplant recipient BM and thus 
plays an important role in homing and engraftment of HSPCs. To support this 
MBL-KO mice show significant defect in hematopoietic reconstitution after 
hematopoietic transplantation. This correlates with a decrease in expression of 
stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and impaired activation of Nlrp3 inflammasome 
in irradiated BM of these mice.

INTRODUCTION: Cannabinoid oils are being increasingly used to treat Dravet 
syndrome, yet the long-term costs and outcomes of this approach are unknown. 
Thus, we examined the cost effectiveness of cannabinoid oil as an adjunctive 
treatment (added to clobazam and valproate), compared with adjunctive 
stiripentol or with clobazam and valproate alone, for the treatment of Dravet 
syndrome in children.
METHODS: We performed a probabilistic cost-utility analysis from the perspective 
of the Canadian public health care system, comparing cannabinoid oil and 
stiripentol (both on a background of clobazam and valproate) with clobazam and 
valproate alone. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated 
using a Markov model that followed a cohort of children aged from 5 to 18 years 
through model states related to seizure frequency. Model inputs were obtained 
from the literature. The cost effectiveness of adjunctive cannabinoid oil, 
adjunctive stiripentol, and clobazam/valproate alone was assessed through 
sequential analysis. The influence of perspective and other assumptions were 
explored in scenario analyses. All costs are expressed in 2019 Canadian dollars, 
and costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 1.5% per year.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained with the use of adjunctive 
cannabinoid oil, from the health care system perspective, was $32,399 compared 
with clobazam and valproate. Stiripentol was dominated by cannabinoid oil, 
producing fewer QALYs at higher costs. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$50,000, cannabinoid oil was the optimal treatment in 76% of replications. From 
a societal perspective, cannabinoid oil dominated stiripentol and 
clobazam/valproate. The interpretation of the results was insensitive to model 
and input assumptions.
CONCLUSION: Compared with clobazam/valproate, adjunctive cannabinoid oil may be 
a cost-effective treatment for Dravet syndrome, if a decision maker is willing 
to pay at least $32,399 for each QALY gained. The opportunity costs of 
continuing to fund stiripentol, but not cannabinoid oil, should be considered.

The golden twin-spot moth or tomato looper, Chrysodeixis chalcites (Esper), is a 
polyphagous and worldwide pest that causes important aesthetic damages to banana 
fruits in the Canary Islands. The life history parameters of C. chalcites were 
determined under laboratory conditions in base on the age-stage, two-sex life 
table at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C, 65% relative humidity (RH), and a photoperiod 
of 16:8 (L:D) h, when it was reared on a semi-synthetic diet. The results show 
that C. chalcites was able to develop and survive from 15 to 30°C, but no 
development occurred at 35°C. Developmental threshold temperatures of the egg, 
larval, pupal, and total preoviposition stages were 10.42, 11.73, 11.22, and 
9.42°C, respectively, and their effective accumulated temperatures were 58.31, 
265.96, 118.57, and 562.39 degree-days, respectively. The adult longevity was 
reduced with increasing temperature, which ranged between 16.27 and 34.85 d for 
females and between 14.27 and 35.21 d for males. The highest values of net 
reproductive rate (R0) and fecundity were observed at 25°C, with 232.70 
offspring and 1,224.74 eggs, respectively. Both the intrinsic rate of increase 
(r) and finite rate of increase (λ) increased significantly and mean generation 
time (T) decreased significantly with increasing temperature. These results 
provide useful information that will allow predicting the impact of climate 
change on the distribution and population dynamics of C. chalcites and 
developing successful integrated management programs.

Background: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab versus 
chemotherapy in the second-line treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma. Materials & methods: A Markov model reflecting the patients in the 
ATTRACTION-3 trial was established. Weibull survival model was employed to fit 
the Kaplan-Meier progression-free survival and overall survival probabilities of 
the nivolumab and chemotherapy strategy, respectively. Meanwhile, one-way and 
PSA were performed to test the uncertainty in the model. Results: Overall, the 
incremental effectiveness and cost of nivolumab versus chemotherapy were 0.107 
quality-adjusted life-years and $14,627.90, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $136,709.35/quality-adjusted life-year. Conclusion: 
Nivolumab is not a cost-effective treatment option compared with chemotherapy 
from the perspective of Chinese society.

INTRODUCTION: Allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (ARC) is an IgE-mediated disease 
that occurs after exposure to indoor or outdoor allergens, or to non-specific 
triggers. Effective treatment options for seasonal ARC are available, but the 
economic aspects and burden of these therapies are not of secondary importance, 
also considered that the prevalence of ARC has been estimated at 23% in Europe. 
For these reasons, we propose a novel flexible cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) 
model, intended to provide healthcare professionals and policymakers with useful 
information aimed at cost-effective interventions for grass-pollen induced 
allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (ARC).
METHODS: Treatments compared are: 1. no AIT, first-line symptomatic drug-therapy 
with no allergoid immunotherapy (AIT). 2. SCIT, subcutaneous immunotherapy. 3. 
SLIT, sublingual immunotherapy. The proposed model is a non-stationary Markovian 
model, that is flexible enough to reflect those treatment-related problems often 
encountered in real-life and clinical practice, but that cannot be adequately 
represented in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). At the same time, we described 
in detail all the structural elements of the model as well as its input 
parameters, in order to minimize any issue of transparency and facilitate the 
reproducibility and circulation of the results among researchers.
RESULTS: Using the no AIT strategy as a comparator, and the Incremental Cost 
Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) as a statistic to summarize the cost-effectiveness of 
a health care intervention, we could conclude that: SCIT systematically 
outperforms SLIT, except when a full societal perspective is considered. For 
example, for T = 9 and a pollen season of 60 days, we have ICER = €16,729 for 
SCIT vs. ICER = €15,116 for SLIT (in the full societal perspective).For longer 
pollen seasons or longer follow-up duration the ICER decreases, because each 
patient experiences a greater clinical benefit over a larger time span, and 
Quality-adjusted Life Year (QALYs) gained per cycle increase 
accordingly.Assuming that no clinical benefit is achieved after premature 
discontinuation, and that at least three years of immunotherapy are required to 
improve clinical manifestations and perceiving a better quality of life, ICERs 
become far greater than €30,000.If the immunotherapy is effective only at the 
peak of the pollen season, the relative ICERs rise sharply. For example, in the 
scenario where no clinical benefit is present after premature discontinuation of 
immunotherapy, we have ICER = €74,770 for SCIT vs. ICER = €152,110 for SLIT.The 
distance between SCIT and SLIT strongly depends on under which model the 
interventions are meta-analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though there is a considerable evidence that SCIT outperforms 
SLIT, we could not state that both SCIT and SLIT (or only one of these two) can 
be considered cost-effective for ARC, as a reliable threshold value for 
cost-effectiveness set by national regulatory agencies for pharmaceutical 
products is missing. Moreover, the impact of model input parameters uncertainty 
on the reliability of our conclusions needs to be investigated further.

AIMS: In the randomized, placebo-controlled Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes 
Trial (COLCOT) of 4745 patients enrolled within 30 days after myocardial 
infarction (MI), low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once daily) reduced the incidence 
of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac 
arrest, MI, stroke, or urgent hospitalization for angina leading to coronary 
revascularization. To assess the in-trial period and lifetime cost-effectiveness 
of low-dose colchicine therapy compared to placebo in post-MI patients on 
standard-of-care therapy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A multistate Markov model was developed incorporating the 
primary efficacy and safety results from COLCOT, as well as healthcare costs and 
utilities from the Canadian healthcare system perspective. All components of the 
primary outcome, non-cardiovascular deaths, and pneumonia were included as 
health states in the model as both primary and recurrent events. In the main 
analysis, a deterministic approach was used to estimate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the trial period (24 months) and lifetime 
(20 years). Over the in-trial period, the addition of colchicine to post-MI 
standard-of-care treatment decreased the mean overall per-patient costs by 47%, 
from $502 to $265 Canadian dollar (CAD), and increased the quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) from 1.30 to 1.34. The lifetime per-patient costs were further 
reduced (69%) and QALYs increased with colchicine therapy (from 8.82 to 11.68). 
As a result, both in-trial and lifetime ICERs indicated colchicine therapy was a 
dominant strategy.
CONCLUSION: Cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that the addition of colchicine 
to standard-of-care therapy after MI is economically dominant and therefore 
generates cost savings.

CONTEXT: Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, 
autonomic dysregulation and neural crest tumor (ROHHHAD[NET]) is a rare and 
potentially fatal disease. No specific diagnostic biomarker is currently 
available, making prompt diagnosis challenging. Since its first definition in 
2007, a complete clinical analysis leading to specific diagnosis and follow-up 
recommendations is still missing.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work is to describe the clinical timeline of 
symptoms of ROHHAD(NET) and propose recommendations for diagnosis and follow-up.
DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of all ROHHAD(NET) case studies and 
report a new ROHHAD patient with early diagnosis and multidisciplinary care.
METHODS: All the articles that meet the definition of ROHHAD(NET) and provide 
chronological clinical data were reviewed according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis individual patient data 
guidelines. The data were grouped into 7 categories: hypothalamic dysfunction, 
autonomic dysregulation, hypoventilation, NET, psychiatric symptoms, other 
clinical manifestations, and outcome.
RESULTS: Forty-three individual patient data descriptions were analyzed. The 
timeline of the disease shows rapid-onset obesity followed shortly by 
hypothalamic dysfunction. Dysautonomia was reported at a median age of 4.95 
years and hypoventilation at 5.33 years, or 2.2 years after the initial obesity. 
A NET was reported in 56% of the patients, and 70% of these tumors were 
diagnosed within 2 years after initial weight gain.
CONCLUSION: Because early diagnosis improves the clinical management and the 
prognosis in ROHHAD(NET), this diagnosis should be considered for any child with 
rapid and early obesity. We propose guidance for systematic follow-up and advise 
multidisciplinary management with the aim of improving prognosis and life 
expectancy.

Missov and Lenart (2013) derived closed-form solutions to the life expectancy 
and remaining life expectancy at age x when the mortality is governed by a 
Gompertz-Makeham hazard, which is a parametric model commonly applied to human 
mortality data at adult and old ages. However, the closed-form expressions 
provided by these authors are not correct. We provide, therefore, valid and 
correct expressions using elementary calculus. We also consider numerical 
studies using real data to show that the formulas we provide deliver 
satisfactory results.

OBJECTIVES:  Dogs with patella alta reportedly have a shorter extensor mechanism 
than normal dogs. The present study aimed to measure the length of the extensor 
mechanism and to assess the effect of limb position on the quadriceps muscle 
length (QML)/femoral bone length (FL) ratio.
STUDY DESIGN:  Three-dimensional computed tomography images were taken of 12 
Beagle dogs. Each dog underwent computed tomographic imaging 24 times with 
different limb positions. The QML/FL was measured on each image, along with the 
hip flexion-extension, hip abduction-adduction and stifle flexion-extension 
angles. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the effect of these 
angles on the QML/FL.
RESULTS:  The QML/FL was increased with the hip extended (standardized partial 
regression coefficient 0.855 with linear plotting, 0.829 with log plotting) and 
with the stifle flexed (standardized partial regression coefficient 0.814 with 
linear plotting, 0.800 with log plotting). The partial regression coefficient of 
the hip abduction-adduction angle was small, indicating a small impact on the 
QML/FL. The 95% confidence range of the QML/FL with the hip extended and stifle 
flexed was 0.87 to 1.00 (mean ± standard deviation: 0.93 ± 0.03).
CONCLUSION:  The QML/FL was more influenced by joint angles when the hip was 
flexed or the stifle was extended. Hence, these positions should be avoided when 
evaluating the QML/FL so that the QML is less altered by slight positioning 
disparities.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy has led to the appearance of a 
subgroup of hip fracture (HF) patients with special characteristics known as 
centenarians. The aim of the present study is to analyse the demographic 
characteristics, complications and mortality rate of this subgroup in order to 
identify the specific risk factors for mortality in these patients.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 69 patients (58 women and 11 men) aged 100 
years or older admitted to a tertiary hospital for HF between 1999 and 2018.
RESULTS: The average age was 101.3 years (100-108, median 101). More than half 
(62.3%) of all patients presented with extracapsular fractures. The most common 
complications observed were delirium (52.3%) and urinary retention (27.7%). 
Haematoma (9.2%) was the most common surgical complication. Only 3 patients 
(7.3%) changed their place of residence after admission. In-hospital, 30-day and 
1-year mortality rates were 13.8%, 21.5% and 54.2%, respectively. A high 
Charlson Comorbidity Index and baseline Functional Ambulation Classification 
(FAC) <3 were associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate (OR = 1.95 95% 
CI [1.03-3.69] and OR = 5.7 95% CI [1.2-26.8]), respectively. The presence of 
more than 3 comorbidities and baseline FAC <3 were associated with a higher risk 
of 30-day mortality (OR = 6, 95% CI [1.4-24.7] and OR = 4, 95% CI [1.13-14.2]), 
respectively. Dementia has been associated with a higher risk of 30-day and 
1-year mortality (OR = 4.6, 95% CI [1.2-16.7]) and OR = 5.11, 95% CI [1.6-21]) 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: FAC score, number of comorbidities, dementia and the Charlson 
Comorbidity Index have been shown to be risk factors of mortality in 
centenarians with HF.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been regarded as an efficient and safe 
treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) since being approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in 1997. It is estimated that more than 150 000 patients 
have been implanted, with a forecasted rapid increase in uptake with population 
ageing. Recent longitudinal follow-up studies have reported a significant 
increase in postoperative survival rates of patients with PD implanted with DBS 
as compared with those not implanted with DBS. Although DBS tends to increase 
life expectancy for most patients with PD, this medical benefit does not come 
without attendant negative consequences. For example, emerging forms of 
iatrogenic harms are sometimes induced-harms which were not initially expected 
when clinicians proposed neurosurgery and patients or their guardians consented 
to the treatment. We report and discuss the clinical case of a patient who was 
implanted with DBS more than 20 years ago (at the time of writing) and is now 
experiencing unexpected stages of PD. This case illustrates how extending the 
life span without improving quality of life may introduce a burden of harms for 
patients and families. As well, this case shows why we should prepare for the 
expanding numbers of PD-implanted patients experiencing a gain of longevity but 
with severe stages of disease leading to diminution in quality of life. This 
newly observed effect of DBS treatment requires us to explore ethical questions 
related to iatrogenic harms, informed consent, end of life and caregivers' 
burden.

INTRODUCTION: In clinical trials of alemtuzumab, autoimmune thyroid adverse 
events (AEs) were frequent. Here, we assess the impact of thyroid AEs on 
health-related quality of life (HRQL) in alemtuzumab-treated patients with 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
METHODS: In phase 3 CARE-MS I (NCT00530348) and II (NCT00548405) trials, 
patients with RRMS were administered alemtuzumab 12 mg/day on 5 consecutive days 
at baseline and on 3 consecutive days 12 months later. Patients could 
participate in an extension study (NCT00930553) through year 6. HRQL was 
assessed at baseline and annually using the Functional Assessment of Multiple 
Sclerosis (FAMS), EuroQoL-5 Dimension Visual Analog Scale (EQ-5D VAS), and 
36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36) questionnaires. Outcomes were analyzed in 
patients with or without thyroid AEs (nonserious or serious). A subset of 
patients with thyroid AEs was analyzed to assess HRQL before and during the 
onset of thyroid AEs.
RESULTS: A total of 811 CARE-MS patients were treated with alemtuzumab. Of 
these, 342 (42%) patients experienced thyroid AEs over 6 years; serious thyroid 
AEs occurred in 44 (5%) patients. At year 6, HRQL outcomes generally remained 
slightly improved or similar to core study baseline in alemtuzumab-treated 
patients with or without thyroid AEs: FAMS (least-squares mean change from 
baseline without thyroid AEs, 0.7; with nonserious thyroid AEs, 5.1; with 
serious thyroid AEs, - 5.3), EQ-5D VAS (2.0; 3.0; - 6.8), SF-36 mental component 
summary (MCS [0.6; 1.6; - 2.8]), SF-36 physical component summary (PCS [0.8; 
1.0; 1.1]). Over 6 years, 63-82% of patients in each group had improved/stable 
SF-36 MCS and PCS scores. Among patients with thyroid AE onset in year 3 (peak 
incidence), there were minimal differences between HRQL outcomes before onset 
(year 2) and after onset (year 3).
CONCLUSION: Autoimmune thyroid AEs (serious and nonserious) had minimal impact 
on HRQL in alemtuzumab-treated patients. These data may aid therapeutic 
decisions in patients with relapsing MS.

Plain Language Summary: This study looked at alemtuzumab, an approved treatment 
for multiple sclerosis (MS). People who receive alemtuzumab may develop thyroid 
problems. The researchers wanted to know whether people who developed thyroid 
problems with alemtuzumab had a worse quality of life compared with those who 
did not. The researchers measured quality of life using a questionnaire. The 
questionnaire looked at people’s physical, social, and psychological well-being 
over 6 years. A total of 811 people with MS treated with alemtuzumab took part 
in this study. Of these, 469 people (58%) did not develop thyroid problems and 
342 people (42%) developed thyroid problems. The thyroid problems were serious 
in 44 people. The researchers observed that thyroid problems during alemtuzumab 
treatment did not make quality of life worse in most people. Some people with 
serious thyroid problems had worsened quality of life; this was mostly among 
people who required certain treatments for their thyroid problems. Quality of 
life did not change much in people while the thyroid problems were ongoing. This 
study shows that thyroid problems after alemtuzumab treatment for MS have little 
negative impact on quality of life for most people. These findings may help 
healthcare providers make decisions about MS treatment.

INTRODUCTION: BAY 94-9027 is a newly developed extended half-life product to 
treat haemophilia, allowing for fewer injections than with standard products. 
This post hoc analysis aimed to compare physicians' and patients' opinions on 
BAY 94-9027 prophylaxis, and explore how qualitative interview data is aligned 
with the data from the Haemophilia-specific Quality of Life questionnaire for 
Adults (Haemo-QoL-A).
METHODS: Exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted with physicians and 
patients by phone upon the exit of patients from the PROTECT VIII extension 
phase following a semi-directed guide. In this post hoc analysis, all 
transcripts were reviewed and reported concepts were compared to assess the 
level of concordance between physicians and patients. These qualitative data 
were compared with the Haemo-QoL-A mean global and subscale scores at baseline 
and end of main phase (36 weeks later).
RESULTS: Ten physicians and 16 patients (mean age 47 years) from Israel, the 
Netherlands and the USA were interviewed. Significant improvements were reported 
by all physicians from baseline [e.g. lower frequency of bleeds (80%), 
improvement in emotional functioning (90%)], which is in concordance with 
patients' reports. The improved confidence reported by physicians cascaded to 
greater participation in various activities, resulting in a better perceived 
emotional state and a significant improvement on the Haemo-QoL-A emotional 
impact subscale score (p = 0.04) between baseline and end of main phase. Most 
physicians (80%) reported improvement in bleed frequency, as patients did (88%).
