The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is one of the most recognized global 
patterns of species richness exhibited across a wide range of taxa. Numerous 
hypotheses have been proposed in the past two centuries to explain LDG, but 
rigorous tests of the drivers of LDGs have been limited by a lack of 
high-quality global species richness data. Here we produce a high-resolution 
(0.025° × 0.025°) map of local tree species richness using a global forest 
inventory database with individual tree information and local biophysical 
characteristics from ~1.3 million sample plots. We then quantify drivers of 
local tree species richness patterns across latitudes. Generally, annual mean 
temperature was a dominant predictor of tree species richness, which is most 
consistent with the metabolic theory of biodiversity (MTB). However, MTB 
underestimated LDG in the tropics, where high species richness was also 
moderated by topographic, soil and anthropogenic factors operating at local 
scales. Given that local landscape variables operate synergistically with 
bioclimatic factors in shaping the global LDG pattern, we suggest that MTB be 
extended to account for co-limitation by subordinate drivers.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the development of an area-level measure of children's 
opportunity, the Ohio Children's Opportunity Index (OCOI).
DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Secondary data were collected from US census 
based-American Community Survey (ACS), US Environmental Protection Agency, US 
Housing and Urban Development, Ohio Vital Statistics, US Department of 
Agriculture-Economic Research Service, Ohio State University Center for Urban 
and Regional Analysis, Ohio Incident Based Reporting System, IPUMS National 
Historical Geographic Information System, and Ohio Department of Medicaid. Data 
were aggregated to census tracts across two time periods.
STUDY DESIGN: OCOI domains were selected based on existing literature, which 
included family stability, infant health, children's health, access, education, 
housing, environment, and criminal justice domains. The composite index was 
developed using an equal weighting approach. Validation analyses were conducted 
between OCOI and health and race-related outcomes, and a national index.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Composite OCOI scores ranged from 0-100 with an average 
value of 74.82 (SD, 17.00). Census tracts in the major metropolitan cities 
across Ohio represented 76% of the total census tracts in the least advantaged 
OCOI septile. OCOI served as a significant predictor of health and race-related 
outcomes. Specifically, the average life expectancy at birth of children born in 
the most advantaged septile was approximately 9 years more than those born in 
least advantaged septile. Increases in OCOI were associated with decreases in 
proportion of Black (48 points lower in the most advantaged vs. least advantaged 
septile), p < 0.001) and Minority populations (54 points lower in most 
advantaged vs. least advantaged septile, p < 0.001). We found R-squared values > 
0.50 between the OCOI and the national Child Opportunity Index scores. 
Temporally, OCOI decreased by 1% between the two study periods, explained mainly 
by decreases in the children health, accessibility and environmental domains.
CONCLUSION: As the first opportunity index developed for children in Ohio, the 
OCOI is a valuable resource for policy reform, especially related to health 
disparities and health equity. Health care providers will be able to use it to 
obtain holistic views on their patients and implement interventions that can 
tackle barriers to childhood development using a more tailored approach.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To clarify whether the presence or absence of fast 
walking and habitual physical activity are independently associated with the 
incidence of functional disability.
METHODS: This historical cohort study was comprised of 9,652 (4,412 men, mean 
age 65 years) individuals aged 39-98 years without functional disability at 
baseline. Functional disability was determined based on the Japanese long-term 
care insurance system, which specified requirements for assistance in the 
activities of daily living. The impact of fast walking and habitual physical 
activity on the incidence of functional disability was analysed by Cox 
proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: The follow-up period was a median of 3.7 years during which 165 
patients were newly certified as having functional disability. In the 
multivariate analysis, baseline age in 5-year increments (hazard ratio 2.42 [95% 
confidence interval 2.18-2.69]), no habitual physical activity (1.56 
[1.07-2.27]), and not fast walking (1.89 [1.32-2.69]) significantly increased 
the risk of functional disability after adjustment for covariates. The 
stratified analysis showed that compared with physical activity (+), the impact 
of physical activity (-) on the incidence of functional disability was observed 
in those aged ≥75 years regardless of fast walking (+). Fast walking (-) 
significantly increased the risk of disability compared with fast walking (+) in 
those aged <75 years regardless of a physical activity habit.
CONCLUSION: In Japanese, slow walking speed and lack of a physical activity 
habit were shown to be independent risk factors for incident functional 
disability, with their impact differing according to age.

incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years for 21 world regions 
and globally from 1990 to 2019: An age-period-cohort analysis.

BACKGROUND: Severe periodontitis is one of the most prevalent diseases and a 
global public health problem due to its high incidence and prevalence. However, 
there are few studies on the burden of periodontitis in different regions of the 
world.
METHODS: We extracted data on the incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) from the Global Burden of Disease study as severe 
periodontitis burden measures. We also explored the global burden of severe 
periodontitis according to 21 world regions and Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) 
quintiles. The joinpoint model was used to analyze temporal trends of major 
regions from 1990 to 2019, and the age-period-cohort model was used to estimate 
age, period, and cohort trends in severe periodontitis.
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized 
prevalence rate (ASPR), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate 
increased from 1990 to 2019 (percentage change: 5.77%, 7.78%, and 8.01%, 
respectively), with average annual percent changes of 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.3%, 
respectively. The region with the highest DALY rate was western sub-Saharan 
Africa with a value of 142.5 (95% uncertainty interval: 56.3, 303.7) per 100,000 
in 2019. For the ASIR, ASPR, and DALY, the age effect of severe periodontitis 
showed an increase followed by a decrease, the period effect showed an upward 
trend, the cohort effect showed an overall decreasing trend, and the cohort 
relative risk for incidence for some SDI quintiles showed a slight increase in 
recent years.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral health varies significantly across regions, and it is 
essential to address inequalities in oral health between countries. Effective 
measures to prevent severe periodontitis risk factors should also be taken in 
regions with low SDI.

With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receding, many countries are pondering 
what a post-pandemic economy should look like. Some advocate a more inclusive 
stakeholder model of capitalism. Others caution that this would be insufficient 
to deal with our pre-pandemic crises of income inequality and climate change. 
Many countries emphasize a 'green recovery' with improved funding for health and 
social protection. Progressive tax reform and fiscal policy innovations are 
needed, but there is concern that the world is already tilting towards a new 
round of austerity. Fundamentally, the capitalist growth economy rests on levels 
of material consumption that are unsustainable and inequitable. More radical 
proposals thus urge 'degrowth' policies to reduce consumption levels while 
redistributing wealth and income to allow the poorer half of humanity to achieve 
an ethical life expectancy. We have the policy tools to do so. We need an 
activist public health movement to ensure there is sufficient political will to 
adopt them.

BACKGROUND: Precision cancer medicine (PCM), frequently used for the expensive 
and often modestly efficacious off-label treatment with medications matched to 
the tumour genome of end-stage cancer, challenges healthcare resources. We 
compared the health effects, costs and cost-effectiveness of our MetAction PCM 
study with corresponding data from comparator populations given best supportive 
care (BSC) in two external randomised controlled trials.
METHODS: We designed three partitioned survival models to evaluate the 
healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the main outcomes. 
Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of PCM relative to BSC with an annual willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold 
of EUR 56,384 (NOK 605,000). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
addressed uncertainty.
RESULTS: We estimated total healthcare costs (relating to next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) equipment and personnel wages, molecularly matched medications 
to the patients with an actionable tumour target and follow-up of the responding 
patients) and the health outcomes for the MetAction patients versus costs 
(relating to estimated hospital admission) and outcomes for the BSC cases. The 
ICERs for incremental QALYs were twice or more as high as the WTP threshold and 
relatively insensitive to cost decrease of the NGS procedures, while reduction 
of medication prices would contribute significantly towards a cost-effective PCM 
strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: The models suggested that the high ICERs of PCM were driven by 
costs of the NGS diagnostics and molecularly matched medications, with a 
likelihood for the strategy to be cost-effective defying WTP constraints. 
Reducing drug expenses to half the list price would likely result in an ICER at 
the WTP threshold. This can be an incentive for a public-private partnership for 
sharing drug costs in PCM, exemplified by ongoing European initiatives.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results in various 
fields of medicine. It has the potential to facilitate shared decision making 
(SDM). However, there is no comprehensive mapping of how AI may be used for SDM.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify and evaluate published studies that have tested 
or implemented AI to facilitate SDM.
METHODS: We performed a scoping review informed by the methodological framework 
proposed by Levac et al, modifications to the original Arksey and O'Malley 
framework of a scoping review, and the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review 
framework. We reported our results based on the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) 
reporting guideline. At the identification stage, an information specialist 
performed a comprehensive search of 6 electronic databases from their inception 
to May 2021. The inclusion criteria were: all populations; all AI interventions 
that were used to facilitate SDM, and if the AI intervention was not used for 
the decision-making point in SDM, it was excluded; any outcome related to 
patients, health care providers, or health care systems; studies in any health 
care setting, only studies published in the English language, and all study 
types. Overall, 2 reviewers independently performed the study selection process 
and extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. A 
descriptive analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The search process yielded 1445 records. After removing duplicates, 894 
documents were screened, and 6 peer-reviewed publications met our inclusion 
criteria. Overall, 2 of them were conducted in North America, 2 in Europe, 1 in 
Australia, and 1 in Asia. Most articles were published after 2017. Overall, 3 
articles focused on primary care, and 3 articles focused on secondary care. All 
studies used machine learning methods. Moreover, 3 articles included health care 
providers in the validation stage of the AI intervention, and 1 article included 
both health care providers and patients in clinical validation, but none of the 
articles included health care providers or patients in the design and 
development of the AI intervention. All used AI to support SDM by providing 
clinical recommendations or predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of the use of AI in SDM is in its infancy. We found AI 
supporting SDM in similar ways across the included articles. We observed a lack 
of emphasis on patients' values and preferences, as well as poor reporting of AI 
interventions, resulting in a lack of clarity about different aspects. Little 
effort was made to address the topics of explainability of AI interventions and 
to include end-users in the design and development of the interventions. Further 
efforts are required to strengthen and standardize the use of AI in different 
steps of SDM and to evaluate its impact on various decisions, populations, and 
settings.

INTRODUCTION: Examining burden of diseases could shed light on priorities of 
public health interventions and research funding. This study examined trends of 
the U.S. top leading causes of death from 1981 to 2019 using the total number of 
deaths, age-adjusted death rate, and years of potential life lost (YPLLs).
METHODS: Data were from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting 
System. This study gathered total number of deaths, age-adjusted death rates per 
100,000 people, and YPLLs under 70 y of age (YPLL-70) from 1981 to 2019 for the 
top 10 leading causes of death and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for each year. The 39 y from 1981 to 2019 were 
evenly divided into three study periods: 1981-1993, 1994-2006, and 2007-2019. 
The percent change of YPLL-70 over three time periods for the top ten leading 
causes of death and AIDS was calculated. Trends of age-adjusted death rates and 
YPLL-70 of the top five leading causes of death based on the 2018-2019 death 
data were also reported by graphing them against time from 1981 to 2019 to 
highlight major mortality causes. Age-adjusted death rates for the top five 
leading causes of deaths and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) annual 
funding level in 2019 were graphed together to illustrate funding discrepancy in 
injury research and prevention.
RESULTS: The total number of deaths caused by malignant neoplasms in 2019 was 
244,994, followed by 183,442 deaths of heart diseases, 121,476 deaths of 
unintentional injuries, and 41,051 suicide deaths. Despite an initial -22.20% 
drop of YPPL-70 during 1981-1993, unintentional injuries experienced significant 
increases of 19.38% and 18.59% of YPLL-70 in 1994-2006 and 2007-2019, 
respectively. The age-adjusted death rate for unintentional injuries was 1182 
per 100,000 people in 2019, and the NIH funding in the same year was $897 
million. In comparison, the age-adjusted death rate for cancer, heart disease, 
and human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS was 786, 649, and 30 per 100,000 people 
while the NIH funding was $2,560, $2,394, and $3037 million, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Unintentional injuries, suicide, and homicide were consistently 
among the top leading causes of death and YPLL-70, so they should be prioritized 
in public health planning, research, and federal funding allocation. Injury and 
trauma research is severely underfunded by the U.S. premier funding agency.

The General Medical Council (GMC) has voiced its support of less-than-full-time 
(LTFT) training, which has been shown to have a positive impact on workforce 
well-being, burnout and attrition and patient safety. However, barriers to LTFT 
exist within plastic surgery. This study aims to understand plastic surgery 
trainees' perceptions of LTFT and provide practical suggestions for improvement. 
Two surveys were disseminated by the UK Plastic Surgery Trainees' Association 
(PLASTA). Survey 1 formed part of the PLASTA National Training Survey (NTS) 
2021, and all plastic surgery trainees with a National Training Number (NTN) 
were eligible. Survey 2 looked specifically at the lived experience of LTFT 
trainees in plastic surgery. A total of 177 trainees responded to the NTS. Seven 
per cent of respondents currently work LTFT, and 50% would consider it in 
future. Reported barriers to applying for LTFT included concerns about reduction 
in pay, extension of training time, and concerns about trainers' negative 
perceptions of LTFT. Twenty LTFT NTN trainees responded to the LTFT-specific 
survey. The majority of respondents reported an overall positive impact on their 
training and personal lives, although many still encountered negative attitudes 
from trainers and peers. Based on the results of this study, we provide 
practical suggestions to make LTFT more accessible to and acceptable for all 
trainees regardless of reason for applying or gender. Promoting the uptake of 
LTFT and improving the experience of LTFT in plastic surgery will support a 
healthy work-life balance in our workforce, prevent attrition and support gender 
equality.

The oncological treatment can significantly affect patients' health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL), which should be monitored to ensure our patients' 
well-being. The often-used HRQoL measurer is the quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) indicator of the disease burden, describing both quality and quantity of 
life lived. The main aim of the study was to discuss the methodology and 
usefulness of evaluating QALYs using the HRQoL questionnaires: EuroQoL (EQ)-5 
dimensions-3 levels (EQ-5D-3L) and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) in 32 
cervical cancer patients. We obtained the questionnaire and calculated QALYs 
based on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) method. In our study, the total 
scoring of the EQ-Index, EQ-VAS evaluation was 2620 and 2409 points, 
respectively, which corresponds with the QALYs value of 26.2 and 24.9, 
respectively. We expressed the QALYs outcome into the economic equivalent of 
nearly 900,000 US dollars (USD) as the total health profit for both the patients 
and the healthcare system. Obtaining the QALY factor can help establish the 
medical management's influence on the patients' HRQoL and improve the healthcare 
services to ensure the best health outcomes.

With the rapidly changing climate, assessing the global trends of cardiovascular 
diseases (CVDs) attributed to high and low temperatures in different climate 
zones and under varying socio-demographic levels is crucial for regulations, 
preparation, intervention, and clinical practice for CVD. Our study included 204 
countries with global CVD data ranging from 1990 to 2019. We obtained the 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR); disability-adjusted life rate of CVD 
attributed to high, low, and non-optimal temperatures; and socio-demographic 
index (SDI) data from the Global Health Data Exchange. We also downloaded the 
temperature data from the Climatic Research Unit. These 204 countries were 
divided into five climate zones and five SDI levels according to the annual 
average temperature data and SDI in 2019. The temporal trends of CVD burden 
attributed to high, low, and non-optimal temperatures were estimated by using 
the cubic regression spline and the generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). The 
total burden of temperature-related CVD has been declining in the last 30 years. 
However, the burden of CVD attributed to high temperature showed an increasing 
trend. Among different climate regions, the ASMRs of CVD attributed to high 
temperature were the highest in the tropical regions, followed by subtropical 
regions, and the lowest in the boreal regions. In the past 30 years, the burden 
of CVD attributed to high temperatures has shown a significant increasing trend, 
while declining trends are observed for non-optimal and low temperatures. The 
CVD burden attributed to high temperatures is particularly pronounced in warmer 
and low-SDI regions with an increasing trend of CVD burden due to high 
temperature.

OBJECTIVE: For a long time, return to work (RTW) has been neglected in patients 
harboring a diffuse low-grade glioma (LGG). However, a majority of LGG patients 
worked at time of diagnosis. Moreover, these patients now live longer given 
current treatment paradigms, especially thanks to early maximal surgery.
METHODS: We systematically searched available medical databases for studies that 
reported data on RTW in patients who underwent resection for LGG.
RESULTS: A total of 30 studies were selected: 19 considered RTW (especially rate 
and timing) as an outcome and 11 used scales of health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) which included work-related aspects. Series that considered RTW as a 
main endpoint were composed of 1014 patients, with postoperative RTW rates 
ranging from 31 to 97.1% (mean 73.1%). Timing to RTW ranged from 15 days to 
22 months (mean 6.3 months). Factors related to an increased proportion of RTW 
were: younger age, better neurologic status, having a white-collar occupation, 
working pre-operatively, being the sole breadwinner, the use of awake surgery, 
and greater extent of resection. Female sex, older age, poor neurologic status, 
pre-operative history of work absences, slow lexical access speed, and 
postoperative seizures were negatively related to RTW. No studies that used 
HRQoL scales directly investigated RTW rate or timing.
CONCLUSIONS: RTW was scarcely analyzed in LGG patients who underwent resection. 
However, because they are usually young, with no or only mild functional 
deficits and have a longer life expectancy, postoperative RTW should be assessed 
more systematically and accurately as a main outcome. As majority (61.5-100%) of 
LGG patients were working at time of surgery, the responsibility of 
neurosurgeons is to bring these patients back to their previous activities 
according to his/her wishes. RTW might also be included as a critical endpoint 
for future prospective studies and randomized control trials on LGGs.

Disease management programs (DMPs) have shown great potential for optimizing 
care of chronically ill patients, thereby improving health outcomes and patient 
satisfaction. This had led to an overall reduction in healthcare costs. Longer 
life expectancy has led to increased utilization of healthcare facilities, which 
may lead to a rise in costs. DMPs are an effective means of improving care and 
compliance and ultimately curbing inappropriate resource utilization. The 
present study reviews different definitions proposed for disease management, its 
components, the evidence behind it, and the conditions for success. It also 
examines heart failure management as an example of a DMP, exploring the 
complexity surrounding implementation of guideline-based approaches in patient 
care. A literature search on DMPs was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, and 
Google Scholar, including heart failure management programs from articles 
published from 2000 to 2020. This reviewed emphasized on the management of 
important biomarkers and cardiovascular indicators such as glycemic levels, 
urine output to improve efficacy of disease management programme during patient 
treatment. The review concluded that diseases like heart failure can be combat 
by improving the quality of care for patients and reducing the burden on the 
public healthcare system. Moreover, DMPs have proved to be an effective way of 
improving care and compliance with treatment.

Introduction  Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is relatively common and usually 
encountered in elderly population. With steady increase in life expectancy, 
incidence of CSDH also is bound to increase proportionately. Though surgery is 
the treatment of choice and relatively a simpler procedure, recurrence is a 
cause of concern. Embolization of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) is a newly 
evolving treatment modality in CSDH and offers hope in some of the recently 
published case series. Materials and Methods  Five cases of CSDH were subjected 
to embolization of MMA over a period from October 2019 to July 2020. Among them, 
it was employed for treatment in four cases after at least two recurrences 
following surgery, and in one case, it was done as the patient was not fit for 
surgery. All procedures were done under general anesthesia and polyvinyl alcohol 
(PVA) particles were used for embolization. Follow-up of the patients were done 
with computed tomography brain at 4 weeks and after 6 months of the procedure. 
Results  There was no incidence of recurrence in our series. Furthermore, 
embolization per se did not cause any complication or side effect which could be 
directly attributable to the procedure itself. Conclusion  In carefully selected 
patients based on clinical profile and angiographic findings, MMA embolization 
can be an effective modality for the treatment in CSDH.

BACKGROUND: Tibial plateau levelling osteotomy (TPLO) changes the anatomical 
tibial conformation and might alter the positional relationship of the ligaments 
comprising the stifle joint. As a result, it is expected to affect the tensile 
force of the ligaments. However, studies analyzing the details of the effect of 
osteotomy are limited.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of TPLO on the tensile force on the stifle 
ligaments in the intact canine stifle using a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) 
robotic testing system.
METHODS: Eight stifles were categorised into the reference group and nine 
stifles into the TPLO group. The stifles were then analysed using a 6-DOF 
robotic joint biomechanical testing system. The stifles were applied 30 N at 
cranial, caudal, and compression loads and 1 Nm at the internal and external 
torque loads (the load applied to the tibia relative to the femur) on extension, 
at 135° and 120°, respectively. The tensile force placed on the cranial cruciate 
ligament (CrCL), the caudal cruciate ligament, the medial collateral ligament, 
lateral collateral ligament and the total tensile force placed on the four 
ligaments was calculated under each load.
RESULTS: For the caudal load applied to the tibia relative to the femur, the 
CrCL tensile force in the TPLO group was lower than that in the reference group 
at 120° (p = 0.02). The CrCL tensile force in the TPLO group was lower than that 
in the reference group at 120° (p < 0.01) for the compression load. Regarding 
the cranial, internal, and external load, the CrCL tensile force remains 
unchanged between both groups at each angle.
CONCLUSIONS: TPLO reduces CrCL tensile force during compression and caudal force 
application. TPLO may reduce tensile forces contributing to CrCL rupture.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate smoking-related mortality and its contribution to 
educational inequalities in life expectancy in Spain.
DESIGN: Nationwide, observational study from 2016 to 2019. 
Population-attributable fractions were used to estimate age, sex and 
education-specific cause-of-death smoking-attributable mortality. Life table 
techniques and decomposition methods were used to estimate potential gains in 
life expectancy at age 35 and the cause-specific contributions of 
smoking-related mortality to life expectancy differences across educational 
groups.
SETTING: Spain.
PARTICIPANTS: We use cause-specific mortality data from population registers and 
smoking prevalence from the National and the European Health Survey for Spain 
from 2017 and 2019/2020, respectively.
RESULTS: We estimated 219 086 smoking-related deaths during 2016-2019, equalling 
13% of all deaths, 83.7% of those in men. In the absence of smoking, potential 
gains in male life expectancy were higher among the low-educated than the 
high-educated (3.1 vs 2.1 years). For women, educational differences were less 
and also in the opposite direction (0.6 vs 0.9 years). The contribution of 
smoking to life expectancy differences between high-educated and low-educated 
groups accounted for 1.5 years among men, and -0.2 years among women. For men, 
the contribution of smoking to these differences was mostly driven by cancer in 
middle age, cardiometabolic diseases at younger ages and respiratory diseases at 
older ages. For women, the contribution to this gap, although negligible, was 
driven by cancer at older ages among the higher educated.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking remains a relevant preventable risk factor of premature 
mortality in Spain, disproportionately affecting life expectancy of low-educated 
men.

OBJECTIVE: Accurate forecasting the life expectancy of patients with cancer is 
adamantly needed for adequate decision-making in the Palliative Care Services 
(PCS) context. Nonetheless, physician forecast is often inaccurate, hindering 
end of life (EOL) decisions. In this study, we determined the prognostic value 
of two oncology performance status (PS) scales at first referral to PCS.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 6310 patients consecutively admitted to PCS 
at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología (2012-2018). Demographic and PS (as 
per Karnofsky (KPS) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scales) 
information was retrieved and the overall survival of patients calculated 
according to PS. Concordance of each scale was assessed in the overall 
population and according to age.
RESULTS: Overall survival was significantly associated with ECOG and KPS 
(p<0.05). A total of 2278 (36.1%) and 2296 (36.4%) patients were referred to PCS 
in their last month of life and most had a poor PS (ECOG 3-4, 59.1%; KPS <50, 
54.4%). Both PS scales had high concordance in the overall population (K=0.6189 
(KPS); K=0.6058 (ECOG)), but a higher value was observed among the subgroup of 
patients aged ≥65 (K=0.6339 (KPS); 0.6252 (ECOG)). Concordance was lowest among 
younger (≤39) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: PS as assessed by the most widely known tools is strongly 
associated with overall survival of patients with cancer attending PCS. No large 
differences were observed among the scales, though results slightly favour the 
use of KPS. Early referral to PCS and accurate survival prediction can aid in 
relevant decision-making for patients approaching EOL.

Recent guidelines recommend that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening after age 75 
be considered on an individualized basis, and discourage screening for people 
over 85 due to competing causes of mortality. Given the heterogeneity in the 
health of older individuals, and lack of data within current guidelines for 
personalized CRC screening approaches, there remains a need for a clearer 
framework to inform clinical decision-making. A revision of the current approach 
to CRC screening in older adults is even more compelling given the improvements 
in CRC treatment, post-treatment survival, and increasing life expectancy in the 
population. In this review, we aim to examine the personalization of CRC 
screening cessation based on specific factors influencing life and health 
expectancy such as comorbidity, frailty, and cognitive status. We will also 
review screening modalities and endoscopic technique for minimizing risk, the 
risks of screening unique to older adults, and CRC treatment outcomes in older 
patients, in order to provide important information to aid CRC screening 
decisions for this age group. This review article offers a unique approach to 
this topic from both the gastroenterologist and geriatrician perspective by 
reviewing the use of specific clinical assessment tools, and addressing 
technical aspects of screening colonoscopy and periprocedural management to 
mitigate screening-related complications.
