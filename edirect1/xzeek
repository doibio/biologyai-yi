in pests, but the insecticidal mechanisms of these proteins for insect control 
remain unclear. To elucidate the mechanisms, the purified insecticidal protein 
from E. cloacae NK was administered to Galleria mellonella larvae either by 
intraperitoneal injection or by feeding. The number of hemocytes, apoptosis in 
immune cells, and polyphenol oxidase (PO) activity of G. mellonella larvae were 
detected by hemocytometer, Annexin V-FITC/PI, and UV-vis spectrophotometer, 
respectively. With the extension of the invasion time of NK insecticidal 
protein, the number of hemocytes in G. mellonella larvae decreased significantly 
(p < 0.05), whereas the apoptosis rate of hemocytes increased. The activity of 
PO showed a trend of rising-peak-sharp decline and the melanization reaction was 
deepened simultaneously. Moreover, the phagocytosis and coating capabilities of 
hemocytes decreased, and the intraperitoneal injection method was more effective 
than the feeding method. Taking together, the insecticidal protein of E. cloacae 
NK inhibits and destroys the cellular immune response of G. mellonella larvae, 
which suggests an important role in killing the host insect.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy and 
the second leading cause of death worldwide. Efficient non-invasive blood-based 
biomarkers for CRC early detection and prognosis are urgently needed.
METHODS: To identify novel potential plasma biomarkers, we applied a proximity 
extension assay (PEA), an antibody-based proteomics strategy to quantify the 
abundance of plasma proteins in CRC development and cancer-associated 
inflammation from few μL of plasma sample.
RESULTS: Among the 690 quantified proteins, levels of 202 plasma proteins were 
significantly changed in CRC patients compared to age-and-sex-matched healthy 
subjects. We identified novel protein changes involved in Th17 activity, 
oncogenic pathways, and cancer-related inflammation with potential implications 
in the CRC diagnosis. Moreover, the interferon γ (IFNG), interleukin (IL) 32, 
and IL17C were identified as associated with the early stages of CRC, whereas 
lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase type 6 (ACP6), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 
(FLT4), and MANSC domain-containing protein 1 (MANSC1) were correlated with the 
late-stages of CRC.
DISCUSSION: Further study to characterize the newly identified plasma protein 
changes from larger cohorts will facilitate the identification of potential 
novel diagnostic, prognostic biomarkers for CRC.

Atherosclerosis was and remains an extremely common and serious health problem. 
Since the elderly are most at risk of cardiovascular risk, and the average life 
expectancy is increasing, the spread of atherosclerosis and its consequences 
increases as well. One of the features of atherosclerosis is its 
asymptomaticity. This factor makes it difficult to make a timely diagnosis. This 
entails the lack of timely treatment and even prevention. To date, in the 
arsenal of physicians, there is only a limited set of methods to suspect and 
fully diagnose atherosclerosis. In this review, we have tried to briefly 
describe the most common and effective methods for diagnosing atherosclerosis.

Encouraged by randomized controlled trials demonstrating non-inferiority of 
transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical 
aortic valve replacement (SAVR) across all surgical risk categories, there has 
been a dramatic increase in the use of TAVI in a younger patient cohort with 
severe aortic stenosis, endorsed by both European and American Cardiac 
Societies. However, the standard use of TAVI in younger, less co-morbid patients 
with a longer life expectancy can only be supported if there is sound data 
demonstrating long-term durability of transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs). In 
this article, we have reviewed available randomized and observational registry 
clinical data pertaining to TAV long-term durability, placing emphasis on trials 
and registries using the new standardized definitions of bioprosthetic valve 
dysfunction (BVD) and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF). Despite inherent 
difficulties in interpreting the available data, the determination reached is 
that the risk of structural valve deterioration (SVD) is potentially lower after 
TAVI than SAVR at 5 to 10 years, and that the two treatment modalities have a 
similar risk of BVF. This supports the adoption of TAVI in younger patients 
evident in current practice. However, the routine use of TAVI in younger 
patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis should be cautioned due to 
insufficient long-term TAV durability data in this particular patient 
population. Finally, we highlight the importance of future research into the 
unique potential mechanisms that can potentially contribute to TAV degeneration.

Brexucabtagene autoleucel is a chimeric anti CD19 antigen receptor T-cell 
therapy that allows durable responses in relapsed/refractory (R/R) mantle cell 
lymphoma (MCL). The present study compared the clinical and economic outcomes of 
R/R MCL patients (pre-exposed to ibrutinib and chemoimmunotherapy) treated with 
brexucabtagene autoleucel versus Rituximab, bendamustine, cytarabine (R-BAC) in 
the Italian Healthcare System. A partitioned-survival model extrapolated 
survival and healthcare costs of R/R MCL patients over a lifetime horizon. 
Discounted and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY) was 6.40 versus 1.20 for 
brexucabtagene autoleucel versus R-BAC and lifetime costs were €411,403 versus 
€74,415, respectively, which corresponds to a cost of €64,798 per QALY gained. 
The results were highly sensitive to brexucabtagene autoleucel acquisition cost 
and to assumptions on long-term survival, therefore the cost-effectiveness of 
brexucabtagene autoleucel for patients with R/R MCL requires validation with 
longer follow-up data and in specific risk subgroups.

The rise of life expectancy in current societies is not accompanied, to date, by 
a similar increase in healthspan, which represents a great socio-economic 
problem. It has been suggested that aging can be manipulated and then, the onset 
of all age-associated chronic disorders can be delayed because these pathologies 
share age as primary underlying risk factor. One of the most extended ideas is 
that aging is consequence of the accumulation of molecular damage. According to 
the oxidative damage theory, antioxidants should slow down aging, extending 
lifespan and healthspan. The present review analyzes studies evaluating the 
effect of dietary antioxidants on lifespan of different aging models and 
discusses the evidence on favor of their antioxidant activity as anti-aging 
mechanisms. Moreover, possible causes for differences between the reported 
results are evaluated.

BACKGROUND: A spinal cord injury (SCI) from trauma or disease impairs 
sensorimotor pathways in somatic and autonomic divisions of the nervous system, 
affecting multiple body systems. Improved medical practices have increased 
survivability and life expectancy after SCI, allowing for the development of 
extensive metabolic comorbidities and profound changes in body composition that 
culminate in prevalent obesity.
SUMMARY: Obesity is the most common cardiometabolic component risk in people 
living with SCI, with a diagnostic body mass index cutoff of 22 kg/m2 to account 
for a phenotype of high adiposity and low lean mass. The metameric organization 
of specific divisions of the nervous system results in level-dependent 
pathology, with resulting sympathetic decentralization altering physiological 
functions such as lipolysis, hepatic lipoprotein metabolism, dietary fat 
absorption, and neuroendocrine signaling. In this manner, SCI provides a unique 
opportunity to study in vivo the "neurogenic" components of certain pathologies 
that otherwise are not readily observable in other populations. We discuss the 
unique physiology of neurogenic obesity after SCI, including the altered 
functions mentioned above as well as structural changes such as reduced skeletal 
muscle and bone mass and increased lipid deposition in the adipose tissue, 
skeletal muscle, bone marrow, and liver.
KEY MESSAGE: The study of neurogenic obesity after SCI gives us a unique 
neurological perspective on the physiology of obesity. The lessons learned from 
this field can guide future research and advancements to inform the study of 
obesity in persons with and without SCI.

INTRODUCTION: China has the largest population of people with dementia in the 
world and is estimated to have approximately a quarter of the entire population 
with dementia worldwide, bringing a heavy burden on the public and healthcare 
systems. We aimed to analyze the burden of Alzheimer's disease and other 
dementias in China over the past three decades.
METHODS: The data on disease burden owing to Alzheimer's disease and other 
dementias in China from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) 2019 datasets. The estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) 
were calculated to assess the temporal trends, and the ratio of years lived with 
disability (YLDs) to disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was used as an 
indicator to evaluate the healthcare system.
RESULT: In China, the overall age-standardized rates (ASRs) of the prevalence 
and DALYs of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias increased from 1990 to 
2019, and their EAPCs were 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.75) and 
0.26 (95% CI, 0.21-0.31), respectively. ASRs and the total number of dementia in 
females remained higher than in males, but the upward trend in ASRs among men 
was more pronounced than in women. The female-to-male ratio of the 
age-standardized DALY rate peaked in the 75-79 year age group in 2019 
(female-to-male ratio of 1.32). The YLDs:DALYs ratio in China experienced a 
gradual increase and finally stayed above the global average since 2011.
CONCLUSION: China has experienced a remarkably rising burden of dementia over 
the past three decades. The more significant burden of dementia was in females, 
but the potentially increasing burden of dementia in males cannot be 
underestimated.

BACKGROUND: Appendicitis places a substantial burden on healthcare systems, with 
acute appendicitis alone being the most common abdominal surgical emergency 
worldwide. Further characterisation of the disease burden in EU15+ countries may 
help optimise the distribution of healthcare resources. The aim of this 
observational study was to assess the trends in mortality, incidence and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of appendicitis across European Union 
(EU) 15+ countries between the years 1990 and 2019, Supplemental Digital Content 
3, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A589 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs), 
age-standardised incidence rates (ASIRs) and DALYs data for appendicitis in 
males and females were extracted from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study. Temporal trends within the study period were analysed using Joinpoint 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: The median ASMRs across EU15+ countries in 2019 were 0.08/100 000 and 
0.13/100 000 for females and males, respectively. Between 1990 and 2019 the 
median percentage change in ASMR was -52.12% for females and -53.18% in males. 
The median ASIRs in 2019 for females and males were 251/100 000 and 278/100 000, 
respectively, with a median percentage change of +7.22% for females and +3.78% 
for males during the observation period. Decreasing trends in DALYs were 
observed over the 30-year study period, with median percentage changes of 
-23.57% and -33.81% for females and males, respectively, Supplemental Digital 
Content 3, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A589 .
CONCLUSION: Overall, a general trend of decreasing appendicitis ASMRs and DALYs 
was observed across EU15+ countries, despite small overall increases in 
appendicitis ASIRs, Supplemental Digital Content 3, 
http://links.lww.com/JS9/A589 . Variations in both diagnostic and management 
strategies over the study period are likely contributory to the changing trends.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a serious global public health 
problem.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to characterise the regional burden, trends, and 
inequalities of RHD in countries and territories in the Asian Region.
METHODS: The RHD disease burden was measured in terms of the numbers of cases 
and deaths, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), disability-loss 
healthy life years (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs) in 48 countries in the 
Asian Region. Data on RHD were extracted from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease. 
This study analysed changing trends in the burden between 1990 and 2019, 
quantified regional inequalities in mortality, and classified countries by 2019 
YLLs.
RESULTS: There were an estimated 22 246 127 cases of RHD in the Asian Region in 
2019 and 249 830 deaths. The prevalence of RHD in the Asian Region in 2019 was 
9% lower than the global estimate, while mortality was 41% higher. The mortality 
rate for RHD in the Asian Region trended downwards from 1990 to 2019, with an 
average annual percentage change of -3.2% (95% UI -3.3 to -3.1). From 1990 to 
2019, absolute inequality in RHD-related mortality decreased in the Asian Region 
while relative inequality increased. Of the 48 countries studied, twelve had the 
highest level of RHD YLLs in 2017 and the smallest reduction in YLLs from 1990 
to 2019.
CONCLUSION: Although the burden of RHD in the Asian Region has steadily 
decreased since 1990, it remains a serious public health issue requiring greater 
attention. In the Asian Region, inequalities in the distribution of the RHD 
burden remain significant, with economically deprived countries typically 
bearing a greater share of the load.

OBJECTIVE: Pituitary adenomas and their consequences impact mortality and 
morbidity. We studied the healthcare costs, survival, and cost-effectiveness of 
growth hormone (GH) vs no GH replacement in patients with non-functioning 
pituitary adenoma (NFPA).
DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort study including all NFPA patients followed from 
1987 or the date of diagnosis until the time of death or December 31, 2019, in 
the Västra Götaland region, Sweden. Data to assess resource use, costs, 
survival, and cost-effectiveness were collected from patient records and 
regional/national healthcare registries.
RESULTS: A total of 426 patients with NFPA (274 men) with a follow-up of 13.6 ± 
6.8 years (mean ± SD) were included. The total annual healthcare cost was higher 
in patients receiving GH (€9287) than those without GH (€6770), mainly driven by 
a higher pharmaceutical cost. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy (P = .02), 
diabetes insipidus (P = .04), body mass index (BMI) (P < .01), and hypertension 
(P < .01) were all individually associated with a higher total annual cost. The 
survival rate was higher in the GH group (HR [hazard ratio] 0.60; P = .01) and 
reduced in patients with glucocorticoid replacement (HR 2.02; P < .01) or 
diabetes insipidus (HR 1.67; P = .04). The cost per gained life-year for GH vs 
no GH replacement was about €37 000.
CONCLUSIONS: This healthcare utilization study identified several factors 
driving the cost of care in NFPA patients, such as GH replacement, adrenal 
insufficiency, and diabetes insipidus. Life expectancy was increased in those 
with GH replacement and reduced in patients with adrenal insufficiency and 
diabetes insipidus.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a very low interest rate policy was economically 
applied in Korea, and various investment activities through loans were 
activated. Real estate and stock prices rose rapidly, and many people became 
involved in stock investments because of economic instability. However, hastily 
started investment behavior resulted in economic loss and addictive behavior in 
stocks. The phenomenon of using stock investment to satisfy individual sensation 
seeking or addictive dependence on stocks due to lowered life satisfaction 
expectancy can become a serious social problem. However, the improvement of 
distress tolerance and the ability to endure pain despite frequent stock price 
fluctuations or lowered life satisfaction expectancy would be good alternatives 
to prevent stock addiction tendency. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to 
test the moderating effect of distress tolerance on the effect of adults' 
sensation seeking and life satisfaction expectancy in stock addiction 
tendencies. The participants were 272 adults with stock investment experience. 
As a result, distress tolerance significantly moderated the positive effect of 
sensation seeking on stock addiction tendency. In addition, life satisfaction 
expectancy did not significantly increase in the group with high distress 
tolerance even if life satisfaction expectancy was lowered. These results 
suggest that stock addiction can be prevented by enhancing distress tolerance.

BACKGROUND: Orofacial clefts are the most common congenital malformation, but 
the global burden and trends of orofacial clefts have not been comprehensively 
analysed. The aim of this study was to assess the global incidence, deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of orofacial clefts by countries, 
regions, sex and sociodemographic index (SDI) from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: The data on orofacial clefts were obtained from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2019. The incidence, deaths and DALYs were analysed by countries, 
regions, sex and SDI. Age-standardized rates and estimated annual percentage 
change (EAPC) were calculated to evaluate the burden and temporal trend of 
orofacial clefts. The association between EAPC and the human development index 
was assessed.
RESULTS: Globally, the incidence, deaths and DALYs of orofacial clefts decreased 
from 1990 to 2019. The high SDI region showed the biggest downward trend in 
incidence rate from 1990 to 2019, along with the lowest age-standardized death 
rate and DALY rate. Some countries, such as Suriname and Zimbabwe, experienced 
increased death rate and DALY rate over time. The age-standardized death rate 
and DALY rate were negatively associated with the level of socioeconomic 
development.
CONCLUSION: Global achievement is evident in the control of the burden of 
orofacial clefts. The future focus of prevention should be on low-income 
countries, such as South Asia and Africa, by increasing healthcare resources and 
improving quality.KEY MESSAGESThis is the most recent estimate of the global 
epidemiology of orofacial clefts, with some countries not previously 
assessed.The global burden of orofacial clefts showed downward trends from 1990 
to 2019; however, some low-income countries are still suffering from increasing 
burdens.Effective measures should be taken to reduce the burden of orofacial 
clefts in the uncontrolled regions.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant clonal plasma cell disorder in the bone 
marrow and is the second-most common hematologic malignancy in adults. Although 
patients with MM have a moderate life expectancy, it remains a heterogeneous 
disease that often requires multiple lines of chemotherapy for durable control 
and long-term survival. This review outlines current management strategies for 
both transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients as well as for 
relapsed and refractory disease. Advances in drug therapies have widened 
management options and improved survival. In this paper, we also discuss 
implications for special populations and survivorship care.

PCR is indispensable in basic science and biotechnology for in-orbit life 
science research. However, manpower and resources are limited in space. To 
address the constraints of in-orbit PCR, we proposed an oscillatory-flow PCR 
technique based on biaxial centrifugation. Oscillatory-flow PCR remarkably 
reduces the power requirements of the PCR process and has a relatively high ramp 
rate. A microfluidic chip that could perform dispensing, volume correction, and 
oscillatory-flow PCR of four samples simultaneously using biaxial centrifugation 
was designed. An automatic biaxial centrifugation device was designed and 
assembled to validate the biaxial centrifugation oscillatory-flow PCR. 
Simulation analysis and experimental tests indicated that the device could 
perform fully automated PCR amplification of four samples in one hour, with a 
ramp rate of 4.4 ∘C/s and average power consumption of less than 30 W. The PCR 
results were consistent with those obtained using conventional PCR equipment. 
Air bubbles generated during amplification were removed by oscillation. The chip 
and device realized a low-power, miniaturized, and fast PCR method under 
microgravity conditions, indicating good space application prospects and 
potential for higher throughput and extension to qPCR.

Valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is emerging 
as an effective treatment for patients with symptomatically failing 
bioprosthetic valves and a high prohibitive surgical risk; a longer life 
expectancy has led to a higher demand for these valve reinterventions due to the 
increased possibilities of outliving the bioprosthetic valve's durability. 
Coronary obstruction is the most feared complication of valve-in-valve (ViV) 
TAVR; it is a rare but life-threatening complication and occurs most frequently 
at the left coronary artery ostium. Accurate pre-procedural planning, mainly 
based on cardiac computed tomography, is crucial to determining the feasibility 
of a ViV TAVR and to assessing the anticipated risk of a coronary obstruction 
and the eventual need for coronary protection measures. Intraprocedurally, the 
aortic root and a selective coronary angiography are useful for evaluating the 
anatomic relationship between the aortic valve and coronary ostia; 
transesophageal echocardiographic real-time monitoring of the coronary flow with 
a color Doppler and pulsed-wave Doppler is a valuable tool that allows for a 
determination of real-time coronary patency and the detection of asymptomatic 
coronary obstructions. Because of the risk of developing a delayed coronary 
obstruction, the close postprocedural monitoring of patients at a high risk of 
developing coronary obstructions is advisable. CT simulations of ViV TAVR, 3D 
printing models, and fusion imaging represent the future directions that may 
help provide a personalized lifetime strategy and tailored approach for each 
patient, potentially minimizing complications and improving outcomes.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is related to depression and contributes to reduced 
life expectancy in individuals with mental disorders. Stress coping strategies 
are important factors in the development and maintenance of depressive disorders 
and have been related to metabolic disturbances. The aim of this study was to 
determine whether there is a difference in the use of positive (re- and 
devaluation, distraction, and control) and negative stress coping strategies in 
relation to patients' MetS. A sample of 363 individuals (n female = 204, n male 
= 159) with a diagnosis of depression was measured with the Stress Coping Style 
Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory. In addition, we collected data 
on MetS (waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, fasting 
glucose/diabetes, blood pressure/hypertonia) according to the International 
Diabetes Federation. A 2 × 2 design including Mets (with vs. without) and sex 
(female vs. male) was performed to test for differences in stress coping 
strategies. Individuals with depression and MetS scored higher on distraction 
strategies than depressed individuals without MetS (p < 0.01, corrected with 
false discovery rate). In addition, we found sex differences in stress coping 
strategies indicating that women with depression scored higher on distraction 
strategies (p < 0.001, FDR corrected), as well as negative strategies (p < 
0.001, FDR corrected), than men. No significant interaction between MetS and sex 
was found regarding the higher value of stress coping strategies. Findings 
suggest that individuals with depression and MetS used distraction strategies to 
a higher amount to cope with stress, which could be stress eating in some cases, 
than those without MetS. Women with depressive disorders had higher values than 
men on other coping strategies in our sample of individuals with depression. A 
better understanding of MetS and sex-specific differences in stress coping 
strategies might help to plan more effective preventive strategies and 
personalized treatment options for depression.

PURPOSE: Patellar tendon ruptures (PTR) occur predominantly in middle-aged 
patients following indirect trauma. The aim of this study was to quantify the 
short-term results using a suture tape augmentation technique for the repair of 
PTR.
METHODS: All consecutive patients with acute (< 6 weeks) PTR who underwent 
suture tape augmentation between 03/2014 and 11/2019 at a single institution 
with a minimum follow-up of 12 months were retrospectively evaluated. Outcome 
measures included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Tegner Activity Scale 
(TAS) and return to sport rates, Lysholm score, International Knee 
Documentation Committee subjective knee form (IKDC) as well as Knee Injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Additionally, a standardized clinical 
examination and an isometric strength evaluation of knee extension and flexion 
were performed. It was hypothesized that high return to sport rates and good 
functional outcome would be observed and that the majority of patients would not 
present with a severe (> 20%) knee extension strength deficit when compared to 
the contralateral side.
RESULTS: A total of 7 patients (mean age 37.0 ± SD 13.5 years; 6 male/1 female) 
were available for final assessment at a median follow-up of 17.0 (25-75% IQR 
16.0-77.0) months. Three injuries occurred during ball sports, two injuries 
occurred during winter sports, and one injury each occurred during a 
motorcycling and skateboarding accident. The average time between trauma and 
surgery was 4.7 ± 2.6 days. At follow-up, patients reported little pain (VAS: 0 
[0-0.4]). Return to sport was possible for all patients 8.9 ± 4.0 months 
postoperatively at a high level (TAS: 7.0 [6.0-7.0]). Five patients (71.4%) 
returned to the preinjury level of play, and 2 (28.6%) did not return to the 
preinjury level of play. Patient-reported outcome measures were moderate to good 
(Lysholm score: 80.4 ± 14.5; IKDC: 84.2 ± 10.6; KOOS subscales: pain 95.6 ± 6.0, 
symptoms 81.1 [64.9-89.1], activities of daily living 98.5 [94.1-100], sport and 
recreation function 82.9 ± 14.1 and knee-related quality of life 75.9 ± 16.3). 
All patients were very satisfied (57.1%) or satisfied (42.9%) with the 
postoperative result. No postoperative complications were reported. Strength 
measurements revealed a severe knee extension deficit in 3 patients (42.9%), but 
no significant deficit of isometric knee extension or flexion strength in 
comparison with the contralateral side was observed overall (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Suture tape augmentation in acute PTR repair leads to good 
functional outcome without major complications. Although a severe knee extension 
strength deficit may occur in some patients postoperatively, an excellent return 
to sports rate and high patient satisfaction can be expected nonetheless.

Cotton is an important fiber crop cultivated around the world under diverse 
climate conditions and generates billions of dollars in annual revenue globally. 
Biotic and abiotic stresses have caused reduction in yield and productivity of 
cotton crops. In this review, we comprehensively analyzed and summarized the 
effect of biotic and abiotic stress on secondary metabolite production in 
cotton. The development of cotton varieties with improved tolerance against 
abiotic and biotic stress can play an important role in sustainable cotton 
production. Under stress conditions, plants develop a variety of defense 
mechanisms such as initiating signaling functions to upregulate defense 
responsive genes and accumulation of secondary metabolites. Understanding the 
impact of stress on secondary metabolite production in cotton is crucial for 
developing strategies to alleviate the negative effects of stress on crop yield 
and quality. Further, the potential industrial applications of these secondary 
metabolites in cotton, such as gossypol, could provide new opportunities for 
sustainable cotton production and the development of value-added products. 
Additionally, transgenic and genome-edited cotton cultivars can be developed to 
provide tolerance to both abiotic and biotic stress in cotton production.

ADL/IADL-limitations: Evidence from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and 
the Health and Retirement Study.

Metropolitan University.

BACKGROUND: Hearing and vision difficulties are some of the most common deficits 
experienced by older adults. Having either visual or hearing difficulty 
increases the risk of comorbidity, disability, and poor quality of life. So far, 
however, few studies have examined the association between vision and hearing 
difficulties on life expectancy without activities of daily living (ADL) 
instrumental ADL (IADL) limitations (LEWL).
METHODS: Data came from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the 
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the US from 2002 to 2013. The outcome was 
defined as reporting 2+ limitations with ADL/IADL. Life expectancy was estimated 
by discrete-time multistate life table models, for hearing and vision difficulty 
separately as well as for combined vision and hearing difficulties, by sex and 
age.
RESULTS: 13% of men in England and the US had ADL/IADL-limitations, whereas for 
women was 16% and 19% in England and the US. At all ages, either vision or 
hearing difficulty was associated with shorter LEWL compared to no difficulties. 
Dual sensory difficulty (vision and hearing) reduced LEWL by up to 12 years in 
both countries. At the ages of 50 and 60 in England, hearing difficulty was 
associated with fewer years lived without ADL/IADL-limitations than vision 
difficulty. In contrast, in the US, vision difficulty led to fewer years lived 
without ADL/IADL-limitations than hearing difficulty.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of strategies to reduce the prevalence and 
incidence of vision and hearing difficulties has the potential to increase the 
number of years spent without ADL/IADL-limitations.

The main risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is smoking. 
Nicotine and carbon monoxide are two dangerous substances that are found in 
cigarette smoke. The increased heart rate can have an almost instantaneous 
impact on the heart and blood vessels. Smoking is well known to cause oxidative 
stress, endanger the lining of the arteries, and accelerate the accumulation of 
fatty plaque in the blood vessels. It raises the danger of sudden thrombotic 
events, inflammatory alterations, and low-density lipoprotein oxidation. The 
smoke's carbon monoxide decreases the blood's capacity to deliver oxygen, adding
