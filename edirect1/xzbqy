BACKGROUND: Sexuality in the elderly is still a social taboo. A commitment by 
medical practices to address the topic of sexuality in later life is essential, 
given that the sexual health is part of the quality of life.
OBJECTIVES: Identification of barriers and discourse of effects in the 
physician's behavior when dealing with the sexuality of older people.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review and discussion of interdisciplinary literature and 
social discourse. Compilation of expert opinions.
RESULTS: Although the introduction of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors led to a 
removal of taboos concerning erectile dysfunction, the sexuality of older men 
became narrowed to physiological aspects. The elderly still complain that 
consultations concerning their sexuality receives too little attention in 
medical practice. Problems are boundaries of shame and disregard of the 
sexuality of elderly.
CONCLUSIONS: Sexuality in old age will have to become more prominent in medical 
practices, due to demographic changes and changing self-images of the elderly. 
The social role of physicians enables straightforward discussions about 
sexuality. Taking a sexual history and choosing an active approach proved to be 
practicable to discuss sexual problems with older people.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common genetic disorders in the Caucasian 
population, with estimated between 70,000 and 100,000 patients worldwide. Even 
if improved diagnostics and clinical management have led to an increased life 
expectancy, CF still remains a disease that significantly impacts patients' life 
in terms of symptoms, daily functioning, psychological morbidity and health 
related quality of life. Available data suggest that symptoms of anxiety and 
depression, such as in other chronic conditions, are common features in CF 
patients and in their caregivers, with a significant impact on disease outcomes. 
In this review we analyze and discuss the findings of The International 
Depression and Anxiety Epidemiological Study (TIDES), recently published on 
Thorax. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of symptoms of 
depression and anxiety in a large population of adolescents and adults with CF 
and in parents of children with CF, across eight European countries and the USA. 
The TIDES provides useful insights about the psychological/psychiatric 
comorbidities in CF and its conclusions are absolutely shareable. Nevertheless 
some doubts remain on the methods and the tools. Further investigation and 
understanding of anxiety and depression in CF (in terms of prevalence, 
association with clinical, psychological and sociocultural factors) is necessary 
and evidence is crescent that a global and multidisciplinary approach is wanted.

The tremendous potential of biologic drugs is hampered by short half-lives in 
vivo, resulting in significantly lower potency than activity seen in vitro. 
These short-acting therapeutic agents require frequent dosing profiles that can 
reduce applicability to the clinic, particularly for chronic conditions. 
Therefore, half-life extension technologies are entering the clinic to enable 
improved or new biologic therapies. PEGylation is the first successful 
technology to improve pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of therapeutic agents and 
has been applied in the clinic for over 25 years. Over 10 PEGylated therapeutics 
have entered the clinic since the early 1990 s, and new PEGylated agents 
continue to expand clinical pipelines and drug patent life. PEGylation is the 
most established half-life extension technology in the clinic with proven safety 
in humans for over two decades. Still, it is one of the most evolving and 
emerging technologies that will be applied for the next two decades.

Proteins.

We present a new generation of coarse-grained (CG) potentials that account for a 
simplified electrostatic description of soluble proteins. The treatment of 
permanent electrostatic dipoles of the backbone and polar side-chains allows to 
simulate proteins, preserving an excellent structural and dynamic agreement with 
respective reference structures and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. 
Moreover, multiprotein complexes can be well described maintaining their 
molecular interfaces thanks to the ability of this scheme to better describe the 
actual electrostatics at a CG level of resolution. An efficient and robust 
heuristic algorithm based on particle swarm optimization is used for the 
derivation of CG parameters via a force-matching procedure. The ability of this 
protocol to deal with high dimensional search spaces suggests that the extension 
of this optimization procedure to larger data sets may lead to the generation of 
a fully transferable CG force field. At the present stage, these 
electrostatic-consistent CG potentials are easily and efficiently parametrized, 
show a good degree of transferability, and can be used to simulate soluble 
proteins or, more interestingly, large macromolecular assemblies for which long 
all-atom simulations may not be easily affordable.

The cost-effectiveness of rituximab in combination with 
fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (R-FC) for the first line treatment of chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was evaluated. Based on long-term clinical data 
(follow-up of 5.9 years) from the CLL8-trial, a Markov-model with three health 
states (Free from disease progression, Progressive disease, Death) was used to 
evaluate the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and cost per life years 
gained (LYG) of R-FC from the perspective of the German statutory health 
insurance (SHI). The addition of rituximab to FC chemotherapy results in a gain 
of 1.1 quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of R-FC compared with FC was €17,979 per QALY (€15,773 per LYG). Results 
were robust in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. From the 
German SHI perspective, rituximab in combination with FC chemotherapy represents 
good value for first-line treatment of patients with CLL and compares favorably 
with chemotherapy alone.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare access and outcomes in cancer patients with schizophrenia 
remain unclear.
AIMS: To investigate the likelihood of early diagnosis and treatment in patients 
with schizophrenia who have cancer and their prognosis.
METHOD: A retrospective matched-pair cohort of gastrointestinal cancer patients 
was identified using a national in-patient database in Japan. Multivariable 
ordinal/binary logistic regressions was modelled to compare cancer stage at 
admission, invasive treatments and 30-day in-hospital mortality between patients 
with schizophrenia (n = 2495) and those without psychiatric disorders (n = 
9980).
RESULTS: The case group had a higher proportion of stage IV cancer (33.9% v. 
18.1%), a lower proportion of invasive treatment (56.5% v. 70.2%, odds ratio 
(OR) = 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.85) and higher in-hospital mortality (4.2% v. 1.8%, 
OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.04-1.75).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia who had gastrointestinal cancer had 
more advanced cancer, a lower likelihood of invasive treatment and higher 
in-hospital mortality than those without psychiatric disorders.

AIM: The management of malignant ureteral obstruction (MUO) is a challenging but 
common problem for urologists. The different techniques currently used to 
address this complicated issue include percutaneous nephrostomy, 
extra-anatomical stents, retrograde (single) stent insertion, and metallic 
stents. In those situations where single ureteral stent insertion has failed, 
retrograde tandem or twin ureteral stent (TUS) insertion can be completed. The 
aim of this study was to report our clinical experience and also assess the 
efficacy of TUS insertion within our tertiary referral center.
METHODS: Data were prospectively collected from patients requiring TUSs over an 
8-year period between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014. A number of 
variables, including the improvement in renal function following TUS insertion, 
were recorded.
RESULTS: Twenty-two TUS insertion procedures were performed on 15 patients 
between the period of January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014. The mean patient 
age was 68.0 years (39-85 years). There were 15 primary insertions as well as 7 
subsequent stent changes. The average prenephrostomy creatinine was 428 μmol/L; 
an average improvement of 196 μmol/L was observed after percutaneous drainage. 
Serum creatinine after TUS remained stable on discharge, 214 μmol/L vs 
227 μmol/L preoperatively, p = 0.34. Eleven patients died at a median 131 days 
post-TUS insertion. TUS failure occurred in three patients; this was 
characterized by rising creatinine and worsening hydronephrosis. Patients with 
failing TUS had a median life expectancy of 45.6 days compared with 162.5 days 
for those with functioning TUS (p < 0.05). Overall, the patency rate at 3 months 
was 80%.
CONCLUSION: TUS insertion is a technically efficient and effective procedure in 
the management of MUO, with the majority of patients treated dying of the 
underlying condition with functioning stents in situ.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical presentation and outcome of nontraumatic 
spontaneous acute spinal subdural hematoma by observing the predictors of 
outcome.
METHODS/RESULTS: This study was based on a case report and systematic review of 
the international literature. Among the 151 patients, 80 were female and 65 were 
male (1.25 female/1.0 male). The age distribution ranged from 6 months to 87 
years, with a small increase in incidence between the first and second decade of 
life and a major peak at age 60 years. The difference of proportion of good 
results between patients with and without established neurologic deficits was: 
0.488, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.237-0.648, P = 2.71e-08; coagulopathy 
was 0.335, 95% CI 0.163-0.508, P = 0.0002; SAH was 0.0539, 95% CI -0.119 to 
0.226, P = 0.6529; lumbar puncture/associated diseases was 0.149 95% CI -0.032 
to 0.330, P = 0.1171; surgery was 0.0593, 95% CI -0.114 to 0.233, P = 0.5838; 
and hematoma extension equal or longer than 5 levels was 0.010 95% CI -0.178 to 
0.197, P = 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Although mortality and morbidity associated with nontraumatic 
spontaneous acute spinal subdural hematoma has decreased during the last 2 
decades, the disease still carries a mortality rate of approximately1.3% and a 
morbidity (permanent neurologic deficits) rate of 28%. The main factors 
affecting the outcome are neurologic status at presentation and coagulopathies.

Ageing is marked by physical decline. Caenorhabditis elegans is a valuable model 
for identifying genetic regulatory mechanisms of ageing and longevity. Here we 
report a simple method to assess C. elegans' maximum physical ability based on 
the worms' maximum movement velocity. We show maximum velocity declines with 
age, correlates well with longevity, accurately reports movement ability and, if 
measured in mid-adulthood, is predictive of maximal lifespan. Contrary to recent 
findings, we observe that maximum velocity of worm with mutations in 
daf-2(e1370) insulin/IGF-1 signalling scales with lifespan. Because of increased 
odorant receptor expression, daf-2(e1370) mutants prefer food over exploration, 
causing previous on-food motility assays to underestimate movement ability and, 
thus, worm health. Finally, a disease-burden analysis of published data reveals 
that the daf-2(e1370) mutation improves quality of life, and therefore combines 
lifespan extension with various signs of an increased healthspan.

Stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) increases life span and 
health span in nematodes through an unknown mechanism. We report that neuronal 
stabilization of HIF-1 mediates these effects in Caenorhabditis elegans through 
a cell nonautonomous signal to the intestine, which results in activation of the 
xenobiotic detoxification enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase-2 (FMO-2). This 
prolongevity signal requires the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme TPH-1 in neurons 
and the serotonin receptor SER-7 in the intestine. Intestinal FMO-2 is also 
activated by dietary restriction (DR) and is necessary for DR-mediated life-span 
extension, which suggests that this enzyme represents a point of convergence for 
two distinct longevity pathways. FMOs are conserved in eukaryotes and induced by 
multiple life span-extending interventions in mice, which suggests that these 
enzymes may play a critical role in promoting health and longevity across phyla.

Marfan syndrome is a heritable, systemic disorder of the connective tissue with 
a high penetrance, named after Dr. Antoine Marfan. The most clinically important 
manifestations of this syndrome are cardiovascular pathologies which cause 
life-threatening events, such as acute aortic dissections, aortic rupture and 
regurgitation of the aortic valve or other artrioventricular valves leading to 
heart failure. These events play important roles in the life expectancy of 
patients with this disorder, especially prior to the development of effective 
surgical approaches for proximal ascending aortic disease. To prevent such 
catastrophic aortic events, a lower threshold has been recommended for 
prophylactic interventions on the aortic root. After prophylactic root 
replacement, disease in the aorta beyond the root and distal to the arch remains 
a cause for concern. Multiple surgeries are required throughout a patient's 
lifetime that can be problematic due to distal lesions complicated by 
dissection. Many controversies in surgical strategies remain, such as 
endovascular repair, to manage such complex cases. This review examines the 
trends in surgical strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in 
patients with Marfan syndrome, and current perspectives in this field.

AIMS: To develop consensus-based recommendations for the management of chronic 
complex patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a two round Delphi 
technique.
METHODS: Experts from the Diabetes and Obesity Working Group (DOWG) of the 
Spanish Society of Internal Medicine (SEMI) reviewed MEDLINE, PubMed, SCOPUS and 
Cochrane Library databases up to September 2014 to gather information on 
organization and health care management, stratification of therapeutic targets 
and therapeutic approach for glucose control in chronic complex patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus. A list of 6 recommendations was created and rated by a 
panel of 75 experts from the DOWG by email (first round) and by open discussion 
(second round). A written document was produced and sent back to DOWG experts 
for clarification purposes.
RESULTS: A high degree of consensus was achieved for all recommendations 
summarized as 1) there is a need to redesign and test new health care programs 
for chronic complex patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus; 2) therapeutic 
targets in patients with short life expectancy should be individualized in 
accordance to their personal, clinical and social characteristics; 3) patients 
with chronic complex conditions and type 2 diabetes mellitus should be 
stratified by hypoglycemia risk; 4) age and specific comorbidities should guide 
the objectives for glucose control; 5) the risk of hypoglycemia should be a key 
factor when choosing a treatment; and 6) basal insulin analogs compared to human 
insulin are cost-effective options.
CONCLUSION: The assessment and recommendations provided herein represent our 
best professional judgment based on current data and clinical experience.

Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are more likely to experience 
preventable medical health issues, such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, 
and cardiovascular disease, than the general population. To further compound 
this issue, these individuals are less likely to seek preventative medical care. 
These factors result in higher usage of expensive emergency care, lower quality 
of care, and lower life expectancy. This manuscript presents literature that 
examines the health disparities this population experiences, and barriers to 
accessing primary care. Through the identification of these barriers, we 
recommend that the field of family medicine work in collaboration with the field 
of mental health to implement 'reverse' integrated care (RIC) systems, and 
provide primary care services in the mental health settings. By embedding 
primary care practitioners in mental health settings, where individuals with SMI 
are more likely to present for treatment, this population may receive treatment 
for somatic care by experts. This not only would improve the quality of care 
received by patients, but would also remove the burden of managing complex 
somatic care from providers trained in mental health. The rationale for this RIC 
system, as well as training and policy reforms, are discussed.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the impact of past and future changes in obesity 
and diabetes prevalence in mid-life on disability prevalence for adult 
Australians.
METHODS: We analysed data from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle 
study (AusDiab) including participants aged 45-64years, disability-free at 
baseline (1999/2000) with disability information at follow-up (2011/12) 
(n=2107). We used coefficients from multinomial logistic regression to predict 
10-year probabilities of disability and death from baseline predictors (age, 
sex, obesity, smoking, diabetes and hypertension). We estimated the prevalence 
of disability attributable to past (1980) and expected future (2025) changes in 
obesity and diabetes prevalence using the life table approach.
RESULTS: We estimated that the prevalence of disability for those aged between 
55 and 74years would have been 1697 cases per 100,000 persons less in 2010 
(10.3% less) if the rates of obesity and diabetes observed in 2000 had been as 
low as the levels observed in 1980. However, if instead the prevalence of 
obesity and diabetes had been as high as the levels expected in 2025, then the 
prevalence of disability would have been an additional 2173 per 100,000 persons 
(an additional 13.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate, for the first time, a substantial potential impact 
of obesity and diabetes trends on disability amongst those aged 55-74years. In 
Australian adults by 2025 we estimate that around 26% of disability cases would 
have been avoidable if there had been no change in obesity and diabetes 
prevalence since 1980. A similar impact is likely around the world in developed 
countries.

A novel tetralignan, tatarinan T (1) with the rare C8-C7' linkage pattern, along 
with a known monolignan (2) were isolated from the roots of Acorus tatarinowii 
Schott. Their chemical structures were elucidated on the basis of NMR and X-ray 
diffraction analysis. We evaluated the protective effects of two rare lignans 
against β-amyloid toxicity by using CL4176 transgenic C. elegans model for the 
first time, and found that they significantly delayed paralysis of worms at the 
concentration of 100 μM. Compound 2 exhibited the more potential protective 
effect against β-amyloid toxicity, its value of PT50 extended up to 62.3% at 100 
μM compared with control, especially, it still has 30.8% extension at 10 μM.

The stages of Cryptosporidium parvum asexual exogenous development were 
investigated at high ultra-structural resolution in cell-free culture using 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Early C. parvum trophozoites were ovoid 
in shape, 1.07 × 1.47 μm(2) in size, and contained a large nucleus and adjacent 
Golgi complex. Dividing and mature meronts containing four to eight developing 
merozoites, 2.34 × 2.7 μm(2) in size, were observed within the first 24h of 
cultivation. An obvious peculiarity was found within the merozoite pellicle, as 
it was composed of the outer plasma membrane with underlying middle and inner 
membrane complexes. Further novel findings were vacuolization of the meront's 
residuum and extension of its outer pellicle, as parasitophorous vacuole-like 
membranes were also evident. The asexual reproduction of C. parvum was 
consistent with the developmental pattern of both eimerian coccidia and 
Arthrogregarinida (formerly Neogregarinida). The unique cell-free development of 
C. parvum described here, along with the establishment of meronts and merozoite 
formation, is the first such evidence obtained from in vitro cell-free culture 
at the ultrastructural level.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of a multivariate index assay compared to modified 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria and CA-125 in the 
triage of women with adnexal masses.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the multivariate index assay 
(MIA) for use in triaging women with an adnexal mass relative to modified 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (mACOG) referral guidelines 
and CA-125 testing alone.
METHODS: The MIA triage algorithm was based on qualitative serum testing of five 
biomarkers: transthyretin, apolipoprotein, A-1, 2-microglobulin, transferrin, 
and CA-125. An economic analysis was developed to evaluate the clinical and cost 
implications of adopting MIA in clinical practice versus the mACOG referral 
guidelines and CA-125 alone, over a lifetime horizon, from the perspective of 
the public payer. Clinical parameters used to characterize patients' disease 
status, quality of life, and treatment decisions were estimated using the 
results of published studies; costs were approximated using reimbursement rates 
from CMS fee schedules. Model endpoints included overall survival (OS), costs, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER). The cost-effectiveness threshold was set to $50,000 per QALY. One-way 
sensitivity analysis was performed to assess uncertainty of individual 
parameters included in the analysis. All costs were reported in 2014 US dollars.
RESULTS: Use of MIA was cost-effective, resulting in fewer re-operations and 
pre-treatment CT scans. Overall MIA resulted in an ICER of $35,094/QALY gained. 
MIA was also cost-saving and QALY-increasing compared to use of CA-125 alone 
with an ICER of $12,189/QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the 
ICER was most affected by the following parameters: (1) sensitivity of MIA; (2) 
sensitivity of mACOG; and (3) percentage of patients, not referred to a 
gynecologic oncologist, who were correctly diagnosed with advanced epithelial 
ovarian cancer (EOC).
CONCLUSION: Use of MIA is a more cost-effective triage strategy than mACOG or 
CA-125. It is expected to increase the percentage of women with ovarian cancer 
that are referred to gynecologic oncologists, which is shown to improve clinical 
outcomes. Limitations include the use of assumptions when published data was 
unavailable, and the use of multiple sources for survival data.

BACKGROUND: Although superficial thrombophlebitis of the upper extremity 
represents a frequent complication of intravenous catheters inserted into the 
peripheral veins of the forearm or hand, no consensus exists on the optimal 
management of this condition in clinical practice.
OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) 
concerning the efficacy and safety of (topical, oral or parenteral) medical 
therapy of superficial thrombophlebitis of the upper extremity.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched 
the Specialised Register (last searched April 2015) and the Cochrane Register of 
Studies (2015, Issue 3). Clinical trials registries were searched up to April 
2015.
SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs comparing any (topical, oral or parenteral) medical 
treatment to no intervention or placebo, or comparing two different medical 
interventions (e.g. a different variant scheme or regimen of the same 
intervention or a different pharmacological type of treatment).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data on methodological quality, 
patient characteristics, interventions and outcomes, including improvement of 
signs and symptoms as the primary effectiveness outcome, and number of 
participants experiencing side effects of the study treatments as the primary 
safety outcome.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 13 studies (917 participants). The evaluated 
treatment modalities consisted of a topical treatment (11 studies), an oral 
treatment (2 studies) and a parenteral treatment (2 studies). Seven studies used 
a placebo or no intervention control group, whereas all others also or solely 
compared active treatment groups. No study evaluated the effects of ice or the 
application of cold or hot bandages. Overall, the risk of bias in individual 
trials was moderate to high, although poor reporting hampered a full 
appreciation of the risk in most studies. The overall quality of the evidence 
for each of the outcomes varied from low to moderate mainly due to risk of bias 
and imprecision, with only single trials contributing to most comparisons. Data 
on primary outcomes improvement of signs and symptoms and side effects 
attributed to the study treatment could not be statistically pooled because of 
the between-study differences in comparisons, outcomes and type of instruments 
to measure outcomes.An array of topical treatments, such as heparinoid or 
diclofenac gels, improved pain compared to placebo or no intervention. Compared 
to placebo, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduced signs and 
symptoms intensity. Safety issues were reported sparsely and were not available 
for some interventions, such as notoginseny creams, parenteral 
low-molecular-weight heparin or defibrotide. Although several trials reported on 
adverse events with topical heparinoid creams, Essaven gel or phlebolan versus 
control, the trials were underpowered to adequately measure any differences 
between treatment modalities. Where reported, adverse events with topical 
treatments consisted mainly of local allergic reactions. Only one study of 15 
participants assessed thrombus extension and symptomatic venous thromboembolism 
with either oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or low-molecular-weight 
heparin, and it reported no cases of either. No study reported on the 
development of suppurative phlebitis, catheter-related bloodstream infections or 
quality of life.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence about the treatment of acute infusion 
superficial thrombophlebitis is limited and of low quality. Data appear too 
preliminary to assess the effectiveness and safety of topical treatments, 
systemic anticoagulation or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The efficacy of second-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) plays 
an important role in allowing CML patients to enjoy a normal life expectancy. 
Four tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are presently available: bosutinib, 
dasatinib, nilotinib, ponatinib. Each one has different safety and activity 
profiles, which are reviewed here. No controlled studies are available to guide 
treatment decision, which must be based on the characterization of leukemic 
cells, especially in cases of resistance to TKI, coupled with the safety profile 
of each TKI. Patient comorbidities also play an important role in the treatment 
decision, which can achieve a new durable response in over 50% of treated 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Leptomonas is monogenetic kinetoplastid parasite of insects and is 
primitive in comparison to Leishmania. Comparative studies of these two 
kinetoplastid may share light on the evolutionary transition to dixenous 
parasitism in Leishmania. In order to adapt and survive within two hosts, 
Leishmania species must have acquired virulence factors in addition to 
mechanisms that mediate susceptibility/resistance to infection in the pathology 
associated with disease. Rab proteins are key mediators of vesicle transport and 
contribute greatly to the evolution of complexity of membrane transport system. 
In this study we used our whole genome sequence data of these two divergent 
kinetoplastids to analyze the orthologues/paralogues of Rab proteins.
RESULTS: During change of lifestyle from monogenetic (Leptomonas) to digenetic 
(Leishmania), we found that the prenyl machinery remained unchanged. 
Geranylgeranyl transferase-I (GGTase-I) was absent in both Leishmania and its 
sister Leptomonas. Farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyl transferase-II 
(GGTase-II) were identified for protein prenylation. We predict that activity of 
the missing alpha-subunit (α-subunit) of GGTase-II in Leptomonas was probably 
contributed by the α-subunit of FTase, while beta-subunit (β-subunit) of 
GGTase-II was conserved and indicated functional conservation in the evolution 
of these two kinetoplastids. Therefore the β-subunit emerges as an excellent 
target for compounds inhibiting parasite activity in clinical cases of 
co-infections. We also confirmed that during the evolution to digenetic life 
style in Leishmania, the parasite acquired capabilities to evade drug action and 
maintain parasite virulence in the host with the incorporation of short-chain 
dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR/MDR) superfamily in Rab genes.
CONCLUSION: Our study based on whole genome sequences is the first to build 
comparative evolutionary analysis and identification of prenylation proteins in 
Leishmania and its sister Leptomonas. The information presented in our present 
work has importance for drug design targeted to kill L. donovani in humans but 
not affect the human form of the prenylation enzymes.

PURPOSE: To evaluate optimal salvage therapy in high-risk myelodysplastic 
syndromes patients who have failed a first-line hypomethylating agent (HMA) 
therapy, given that treatment choice is challenging.
METHODS: Using published literature and expert opinion, we developed a Markov 
model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of current treatments for patients who 
failed first-line HMA therapy. The model predicted costs, life years, 
quality-adjusted life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of uncertainty in model 
inputs.
RESULTS: Supportive care was the least expensive option ($65,704/patient) with 
the shortest survival (0.48 years). Low- and high-intensity chemotherapies and 
hematopoietic cell transplantation increased survival and costs with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of $108,808, 306,103 and 318,163/life year, 
respectively. Switching HMA was more costly and less efficacious than another 
treatment option, namely low-intensity chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Subsequent treatments in myelodysplastic syndrome patients who 
failed first-line HMA significantly increase costs, while only providing 
marginal clinical benefit and substantially increasing treatment-related 
morbidities. Additional treatment options would benefit resource allocation, 
clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

Comorbidities and risk factors among patients with schizophrenia.

Centre, University of Sydney, NSW.

General practitioners (GPs) are charged with maintaining a holistic approach to 
their patients' health. While most patients with schizophrenia attend public 
mental health services and/or non-government organisations supporting people 
with mental illness, 88.2% of people with a psychotic illness (the majority 
being schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) had visited a GP in the 
previous year. For at least 30-40% of people living with schizophrenia in 
Australia, ongoing management is provided by their GP alone. Moreover, there is 
evidence that patients with schizophrenia value the help provided by GPs. 
Patients with schizophrenia have reduced life expectancy. Overseas research 
(primarily from the UK and US) has found that the poor physical health of 
patients with schizophrenia can be attributed to a number of factors such as 
modifiable lifestyle risk factors and side effects of medication, compounded by 
causes intrinsic to the illness such as mental stress and loss of initiative.

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: One Woman's Search for Renal-Preserving Therapy.

Coombs EJ.

Everolimus was very effective in the treatment of Anne, a patient with TSC and 
renal angiomyolipomas. Anne's renal tumors continue to shrink in size, with a 
decrease of more than 50% achieved to date, and her GFR remains in the normal 
range. She no longer experiences chronic back pain due to kidney tumors and is 
not taking pain medications. She is active and able to exercise daily, and her 
blood pressure remains within normal limits. Usually diagnosed in childhood, TSC 
requires life-long management. Patients can have many manifestations of the 
disease, and nurses need to be made aware of them because they often play a 
critical role in educating patients and their families (Agricola et al., 2013).
