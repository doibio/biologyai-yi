BACKGROUND: The greatest risk factor for cardiovascular disease is hypertension, 
which can be alleviated via diet, exercise, and adherence to medication. Yet, 
blood pressure control in Nepal is inadequate, which is partly hindered by a 
lack of evidence-based, low-cost, scalable, and cost-effective cardiovascular 
disease prevention programmes. The the community-based management of 
hypertension in Nepal (COBIN) study was a 12-month community-based hypertension 
management programme of blood pressure monitoring and lifestyle counselling 
intervention undertaken by female community health volunteers (FCHVs) in Nepal, 
against usual care, which showed success in reducing blood pressure. Here we 
aimed to retrospectively quantify the budget impact and cost-effectiveness of 
the scale-up of the programme.
METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we collected participant-level data 
from the COBIN study; programme delivery cost data from programme administrators 
from the COBIN study group; and popualtion and other data from WHO, the World 
Bank, and the Nepalese Government. We estimated costs per participant and total 
costs of a national scale-up of the COBIN programme focusing on two scenarios: 
scenario A, delivery of the intervention to only people aged 25-65 years with 
hypertension; and scenario B, delivery of the intervention to all adults aged 
25-65 years regardless of hypertension status. Effectiveness was based on 
in-trial blood pressure reductions converted to cardiovascular disease 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. The primary cost-effectiveness 
measure was incremental cost per averted cardiovascular disease DALY (calculated 
using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) from a health system 
perspective, including programme delivery and incremental medication costs. We 
did univariate sensitivity analyses of scenario B to assess the effect of 
uncertainty in key parameter values in our calculations.
FINDINGS: From a health system perspective, the first-year budget impact was 
US$7·1 million in scenario A and $10·8 million in scenario B. With each 
subsequent year, the costs decreased by approximately 50%. In the base-case 
cost-effectiveness analysis, from the health system perspective, scenario A 
resulted in an ICER of $582 per DALY averted and scenario B resulted in an ICER 
of $411 per DALY averted. The ICER was most sensitive to uncertainty in the 
number of total avertable cardiovascular disease DALYs in the eligible 
population.
INTERPRETATION: The programme is projected to be highly cost-effective in both 
scenarios compared with the WHO thresholds for cost-effectiveness for Nepal. For 
policy makers intending to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goal of reducing 
premature mortality from non-communicible diseases, this intervention should be 
considered.

BACKGROUND: Although the burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa continues to be 
dominated by infectious diseases, countries in this region are undergoing a 
demographic transition leading to increasing prevalence of non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs). To inform health system responses to these changing patterns of 
disease, we aimed to assess changes in the burden of NCDs in sub-Saharan Africa 
from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to analyse the burden of NCDs in sub-Saharan Africa in 
terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)-with crude counts as well as 
all-age and age-standardised rates per 100 000 population-with 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs). We examined changes in burden between 1990 and 2017, and 
differences across age, sex, and regions. We also compared the observed NCD 
burden across countries with the expected values based on a country's 
Socio-demographic Index.
FINDINGS: All-age total DALYs due to NCDs increased by 67·0% between 1990 (90·6 
million [95% UI 81·0-101·9]) and 2017 (151·3 million [133·4-171·8]), reflecting 
an increase in the proportion of total DALYs attributable to NCDs (from 18·6% 
[95% UI 17·1-20·4] to 29·8% [27·6-32·0] of the total burden). Although most of 
this increase can be explained by population growth and ageing, the 
age-standardised DALY rate (per 100 000 population) due to NCDs in 2017 
(21 757·7 DALYs [95% UI 19 377·1-24 380·7]) was almost equivalent to that of 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (26 491·6 DALYs 
[25 165·2-28 129·8]). Cardiovascular diseases were the second leading cause of 
NCD burden in 2017, resulting in 22·9 million (21·5-24·3) DALYs (15·1% of the 
total NCD burden), after the group of disorders categorised as other NCDs (28·8 
million [25·1-33·0] DALYs, 19·1%). These categories were followed by neoplasms, 
mental disorders, and digestive diseases. Although crude DALY rates for all NCDs 
have decreased slightly across sub-Saharan Africa, age-standardised rates are on 
the rise in some countries (particularly those in southern sub-Saharan Africa) 
and for some NCDs (such as diabetes and some cancers, including breast and 
prostate cancer).
INTERPRETATION: NCDs in sub-Saharan Africa are posing an increasing challenge 
for health systems, which have to date largely focused on tackling infectious 
diseases and maternal, neonatal, and child deaths. To effectively address these 
changing needs, countries in sub-Saharan Africa require detailed epidemiological 
data on NCDs.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Assembly 2018 approved a resolution on rheumatic 
heart disease to strengthen programmes in countries where this condition remains 
a substantial public health problem. We aimed to describe the regional burden, 
trends, and inequalities of rheumatic heart disease in the Americas.
METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, we extracted data for deaths, prevalence of 
cases, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years lived with disability, and 
years of life lost (YLL) as measures of rheumatic heart disease burden using the 
GBD Results Tool. We analysed 1990-2017 trends in rheumatic heart disease 
mortality and prevalence, quantified cross-country inequalities in rheumatic 
heart disease mortality, and classified countries according to rheumatic heart 
disease mortality in 2017 and 1990-2017.
FINDINGS: GBD 2017 estimated that 3 604 800 cases of rheumatic heart disease 
occurred overall in the Americas in 2017, with 22 437 deaths. We showed that in 
2017 rheumatic heart disease mortality in the Americas was 51% (95% UI 44-59) 
lower (1·8 deaths per 100 000 population [95% uncertainty interval 1·7-1·9] vs 
3·7 deaths per 100 000 population [3·4-3·9]) and prevalence was 30% (29-33) 
lower (346·4 cases per 100 000 [334·1-359·2] vs 500·6 cases per 100 000 
[482·9-519·7]) than the corresponding global estimates. DALYs were half of those 
globally (55·7 per 100 000 [49·8-63·5] vs 118·7 per 100 000 [108·5 to 130·7]), 
with a 70% contribution from YLL (39·1 out of 55·7 per 100 000). A significant 
reduction in rheumatic heart disease mortality occurred, from a regional average 
of 88·4 YLL per 100 000 (95% uncertainty interval 88·2-88·6) in 1990 to 38·2 
(38·1-38·4) in 2017, and a significant reduction in income-related inequality, 
from an excess of 191·7 YLL per 100 000 (68·6-314·8) between the poorest and 
richest countries in 1990 to 66·8 YLL per 100 000 (6·4-127·2) in 2017. Of the 37 
countries studied, eight (22%) had both the highest level of premature rheumatic 
heart disease mortality in 2017 and the smallest reduction in this mortality 
between 1990 and 2017.
INTERPRETATION: The Americas have greatly reduced premature mortality due to 
rheumatic heart disease since 1990. These health gains were paired with a 
substantial reduction in the magnitude of income-related inequalities across 
countries, which is consistent with overall socioeconomic and health 
improvements observed in the Region. Countries with less favourable rheumatic 
heart disease situations should be targeted for strengthening of their national 
programmes.

Assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain requires the coordinated 
synthesis of mitochondrial and nuclear encoded subunits, redox co-factor 
acquisition, and correct joining of the subunits to form functional complexes. 
The conserved Cbp3-Cbp6 chaperone complex binds newly synthesized cytochrome b 
and supports the ordered acquisition of the heme co-factors. Moreover, it 
functions as a translational activator by interacting with the mitoribosome. 
Cbp3 consists of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain present in 
mitochondrial Cbp3 homologs and a highly conserved C-terminal domain comprising 
a ubiquinol-cytochrome c chaperone region. Here, we solved the crystal structure 
of this C-terminal domain from a bacterial homolog at 1.4 Å resolution, 
revealing a unique all-helical fold. This structure allowed mapping of the 
interaction sites of yeast Cbp3 with Cbp6 and cytochrome b via site-specific 
photo-cross-linking. We propose that mitochondrial Cbp3 homologs carry an 
N-terminal extension that positions the conserved C-terminal domain at the 
ribosomal tunnel exit for an efficient interaction with its substrate, the newly 
synthesized cytochrome b protein.

Bacteriocins are a large group of antimicrobial compounds that are synthesized 
by representatives of the genus Bacillus and lactic acid bacteria. They are used 
extensively in the food industry as biopreservatives. Incorporated in the 
composition of edible coatings, bacteriocins can reduce microbial growth and 
decay incidence in perishable fruits, thus improving product shelf-life and 
commercial appearance. The present study aims to investigate the effect of 
edible coatings of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) enriched with a purified 
bacteriocin from Bacillus methylotrophicus BM47 on the shelf-life extension of 
fresh strawberries. During storage at 4 °C and 75% relative humidity for 16 
days, the measurements of mass loss, decay percentage, total soluble solids 
(TSS), titratable acidity (TA), pH, organic acids, total phenolic and 
anthocyanin contents and antioxidant activity were made. The results demonstrate 
that the application of edible coatings with 0.5% CMC and 0.5% CMC with 
bacteriocin (CMC+B) led to a significant decrease of mass loss in the treated 
strawberries compared to the uncoated fruit. After the 8th day of storage, 
significant reductions in decay percentage along with the absence of fungal 
growth in CMC+B-coated fruit were observed in comparison with the CMC-coated and 
control strawberries. During the second half of the storage period, CMC and 
CMC+B treatments reduced TSS amount in the coated fruit compared to the control, 
but did not affect the increase of TA and decrease of pH values that are 
normally associated with postharvest changes. The CMC and CMC+B coatings did not 
prevent the decrease of ascorbic acid, and total phenolic and anthocyanin 
contents during cold storage. The application of CMC and CMC+B coatings had a 
significant inhibitory effect on decreasing the antioxidant activity throughout 
the storage period and maintained the antioxidant levels in both treatments 
close to the initial value of 76.8 mmol Trolox equivalents per 100 g of fresh 
mass.

Why Do Japan and South Korea Record Very Low Levels of Perceived Health Despite 
Having Very High Life Expectancies?

Japan and Korea follow a unique trend in which, despite reporting two of the 
highest life expectancies (LEs) among the Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) countries, the proportion of people with good self-rated 
health (SRH) is disproportionately low. We sought to explain this 
high-LE-low-SRH paradox by examining associations among LE, the prevalence of 
good SRH, and healthcare utilization. Our hypothesis was that countries with 
more frequent healthcare use would demonstrate poorer SRH and that SRH would not 
show a meaningful association with LE among developed countries. This study 
extracted data from Health at a Glance 2017 by the OECD for 26 countries with 
valid and comparable information on LE, SRH, and the number of doctor 
consultations per capita. Correlations among LE, good SRH, and number of doctor 
consultations per capita were analyzed. The number of annual doctor 
consultations per capita and the prevalence of good SRH were closely correlated 
(correlation coefficient=-0.610); excluding outliers produced a higher 
correlation coefficient (-0.839). Similar patterns were observed when we 
replaced good SRH with poor SRH. Meanwhile, the correlation coefficient between 
annual per capita doctor consultations and LE was quite low (-0.216). Although 
good SRH is closely related to better LE at the individual level, this was not 
true at the national level. Frequent use of healthcare in Japan and Korea was 
strongly correlated with poorer SRH, without any meaningful correlation with LE.

Recent studies have shown that long-term exposure to low-level arsenic 
(<10 μg/L) may cause human health problems. However, the induced cancer risks 
and differences among multisite cancers have not been well-understood. In this 
study, the concentrations of low-level arsenic in drinking water in XP city, 
Northwest China were investigated. A health risk assessment was carried out for 
different age groups and exposure pathways based on Monte Carlo simulations and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The measured arsenic levels were in the 
range of 7.61-9.25 μg/L with a mean of 8.23 μg/L. For the public, the average 
total lifetime cancer risk was 3.87 × 10-4, and the total DALYs estimation for 
all age groups was 20.58 person-year. The average individual DALYs lost was 
3.35 × 10-5 per person-year (ppy), which was 33.5 times the reference value 
(1.00 × 10-6 ppy). The mortality burden had a considerably larger contribution 
(97.31%) to the total disease burden, and the 60-65-year age group exhibited the 
largest DALYs lost. Skin cancer exhibited the largest burden of 2.15 × 10-5 ppy, 
followed by lung cancer (1.20 × 10-5 ppy). This study might be useful for 
potential strategies of risk control and management in XP drinking water.

BACKGROUND: Anterior compartment prolapse is the most common pelvic organ 
prolapse (POP) with a range of surgical treatment options available.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
surgical treatments for the repair of anterior POP.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials 
comparing surgical treatments for women with POP. Network meta-analysis was 
possible for anterior POP, same-site recurrence outcome. A Markov model was used 
to compare the cost-utility of surgical treatments for the primary repair of 
anterior POP from a UK National Health Service perspective.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 27 eligible trials for the network meta-analysis 
involving eight surgical treatments tested on 3194 women. Synthetic mesh was the 
most effective in preventing recurrence at the same site. There was no evidence 
to suggest a difference between synthetic non-absorbable mesh, synthetic 
partially absorbable mesh, and biological mesh. The cost-utility analysis, which 
incorporated effectiveness, complications and cost data, found non-mesh repair 
to have the highest probability of being cost-effective. The conclusions were 
robust to model inputs including effectiveness, costs and utility values.
CONCLUSIONS: Anterior colporrhaphy augmented with mesh appeared to be 
cost-ineffective in women requiring primary repair of anterior POP. There is a 
need for further research on long-term effectiveness and the safety of mesh 
products to establish their relative cost-effectiveness with a greater 
certainty.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: New study finds mesh cost-ineffective in women with anterior 
pelvic organ prolapse.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) is a fast-growing professional sector. As of 
2016, there were more than 259,000 mHealth apps available internationally. 
Although mHealth apps are growing in acceptance, relatively little attention and 
limited efforts have been invested to establish their scientific integrity 
through statistical validation. This paper presents the external validation of 
Psychologist in a Pocket (PiaP), an Android-based mental mHealth app which 
supports traditional approaches in depression screening and monitoring through 
the analysis of electronic text inputs in communication apps.
OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of the study were (1) to externally validate the 
construct of the depression lexicon of PiaP with standardized psychological 
paper-and-pencil tools and (2) to determine the comparability of PiaP, a new 
depression measure, with a psychological gold standard in identifying 
depression.
METHODS: College participants downloaded PiaP for a 2-week administration. 
Afterward, they were asked to complete 4 psychological depression instruments. 
Furthermore, 1-week and 2-week PiaP total scores (PTS) were correlated with (1) 
Beck Depression Index (BDI)-II and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression 
(CES-D) Scale for congruent construct validation, (2) Affect Balance Scale 
(ABS)-Negative Affect for convergent construct validation, and (3) Satisfaction 
With Life Scale (SWLS) and ABS-Positive Affect for divergent construct 
validation. In addition, concordance analysis between PiaP and BDI-II was 
performed.
RESULTS: On the basis of the Pearson product-moment correlation, significant 
positive correlations exist between (1) 1-week PTS and CES-D Scale, (2) 2-week 
PTS and BDI-II, and (3) PiaP 2-week PTS and SWLS. Concordance analysis 
(Bland-Altman plot and analysis) suggested that PiaP's approach to depression 
screening is comparable with the gold standard (BDI-II).
CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of mental health has historically relied on 
subjective measurements. With the integration of novel approaches using mobile 
technology (and, by extension, mHealth apps) in mental health care, the 
validation process becomes more compelling to ensure their accuracy and 
credibility. This study suggests that PiaP's approach to depression screening by 
analyzing electronic data is comparable with traditional and well-established 
depression instruments and can be used to augment the process of measuring 
depression symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed in advanced stages, when survival 
is poor. Treatment advances have been made, but are inconsistently implemented. 
Our purpose was to project the maximum life expectancy gains that could be 
achieved in women with stage IIIC epithelial ovarian cancer if the 
implementation of available chemotherapy regimens could be optimized.
METHODS: We used a microsimulation model to estimate life expectancy benefits 
associated with "optimized" implementation of four post-operative chemotherapy 
options: standard intravenous chemotherapy; intraperitoneal + intravenous 
chemotherapy; bevacizumab + intravenous chemotherapy; and hyperthermic 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy + intravenous chemotherapy. Optimized 
implementation was defined as follows. Patients triaged to primary cytoreductive 
surgery received intraperitoneal + intravenous chemotherapy if optimally or 
completely cytoreduced, and bevacizumab + intravenous chemotherapy if 
suboptimally cytoreduced. Patients triaged to neoadjuvant chemotherapy received 
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy at interval cytoreductive surgery if 
optimally or completely cytoreduced, and standard IV chemotherapy if 
suboptimally cytoreduced. Life expectancy associated with optimized 
implementation was compared with that of current utilization practices, 
estimated using published literature and the National Cancer Database. Effects 
of model uncertainty were evaluated in sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Life expectancy associated with optimized implementation vs. current 
practice was 76.7 vs. 64.5 months (life expectancy gain = 12.2 months). 
Providing intraperitoneal + intravenous chemotherapy to all eligible patients 
was the largest driver of life expectancy gains, due to both the potential 
benefit conferred by intraperitoneal + intravenous chemotherapy and the 
proportion of eligible women who do not receive intraperitoneal + intravenous 
chemotherapy in current practice.
CONCLUSION: Population-level life expectancy in stage IIIC epithelial ovarian 
cancer could be substantially improved through greater uptake of available 
chemotherapy regimens.

BACKGROUND: An increase in the life expectancy of the general population has led 
to heightened numbers of elderly patients in need of coronary artery bypass 
grafting (CABG). Surgical revascularization in octogenarians is becoming more 
commonplace, and outcomes in this cohort continue to gain relevance.
METHODS: All patients who underwent isolated CABG (n = 7048) at the University 
of Pittsburgh Medical Center from 2010 to 2017 were reviewed. A comparative 
analysis between octogenarians (≥80 years) and septuagenarians (70-79 years) was 
performed with primary outcomes that included all-cause mortality and 
readmission at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years.
RESULTS: The total patient population consisted of 2226 patients who were 
divided into two age groups, including 1673 septuagenarians (75.2%) and 553 
octogenarians (24.8%). Mean age was 74.19 ± 2.80 years versus 82.94 ± 2.57 years 
(P < .001) for the first and second cohort, respectively. The octogenarian group 
had higher operative risk represented by a mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons 
Predicted Risk of Mortality of 6.03% ± 6.42% (P < .001). Operative mortality was 
higher in octogenarians (5.24% versus 2.69%; P = .004). Predictors of long-term 
mortality included chronic lung disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.76; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.43-2.17; P < .001), emergent status (HR = 2.09; 95% 
CI, 1.34-3.28; P = .001), and peripheral artery disease (HR = 1.61; 95% CI, 
1.31-1.97; P < .001). Patients 80 years and older had increased risk of both 
cardiac readmission (HR = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.03-1.40; P = .02) and heart failure 
readmission (HR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23-1.91; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: CABG can be performed in octogenarians with acceptable survival 
although they have an increased risk of readmission for cardiac causes, 
specifically, higher rates of heart failure.

CONTEXT: Older and seriously ill Australians are often admitted to hospital in 
the last year of their life. The extent to which these individuals have 
considered important aspects of end-of-life (EOL) care, including location in 
which care is provided, goals of care, and involvement of others in decision 
making, is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To determine, in a sample of older and seriously ill Australian 
inpatients, preferences regarding location in which they receive EOL care and 
reasons for their choice; who is involved in EOL decisions; disclosure of life 
expectancy; goals of care; and voluntary-assisted dying.
METHODS: Cross-sectional face-to-face survey interviews conducted with 186 (80% 
consent) inpatients in a tertiary referral center aged 80 years and older; or 
aged 55 years and older with progressive chronic disease(s); or with 
physician-estimated life expectancy of less than 12 months.
RESULTS: Home care was preferred (69%), given the perceived availability of 
family/friends, familiarity of environment, and likelihood of having wishes 
respected. If unable to make decisions themselves, inpatients wanted family to 
decide care alone (31%) or with a doctor (49%). Of those who had not discussed 
life expectancy, 23% wished to. Most (76%) preferred care that maintained 
quality of life and relieved symptoms. There was some agreement for being 
sedated at the EOL (63%) and able to access medication to end life (43%).
CONCLUSION: Most inpatients would prefer EOL care that maintains quality and 
relieves suffering compared with life extension and to receive this care at 
home. Family involvement in resolution and documentation of EOL decisions should 
be prioritized.

The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a heterogenous group of lysosomal storage 
disorders caused by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The accrual 
of these compounds results in phenotypically varied syndromes that produce 
multi-organ impairment with widespread systemic effects. The low incidence of 
MPS (approximately 1/25,000 live births) in conjunction with the high childhood 
mortality rate had limited the availability of research into certain clinical 
features, especially ocular manifestations. As the recent successes of 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy 
(ERT) have greatly increased life expectancy in these patients, they have served 
as a focal point for the transition of research towards improvement of quality 
of life. Ophthalmological findings in MPS include corneal clouding, glaucoma, 
optic neuropathies, and retinopathies. While corneal clouding is the most common 
ocular feature of MPS (especially type I, IVA, and VI), its response to HSCT and 
ERT is minimal. This review discusses known eye issues in the MPS subtypes, 
diagnosis of these ocular diseases, current clinical and surgical management, 
noteworthy research progress, and ultimately presents a direction for future 
studies.

The objective of this work is the comparative study of different osmotic 
treatments at 37 °C on the quality and shelf life of chilled sea bass fillets. 
Fish fillets were treated using osmotic solutions consisting of oligofructose 
(40%-50%-60%) and 5% NaCl with (BP/OT) and without (OT) former antioxidant 
enrichment by using Rosa damascena distillation by-products. Water activity 
decreased to approximately 0.95 after 330 minutes of osmotic treatment. 
Untreated and osmotically treated fish fillets (BP/OT) and (OT) were 
subsequently stored at 5 °C and their quality was evaluated based on microbial 
growth and lipid oxidation. Osmotic treatment extended significantly the shelf 
life of fish in terms of microbial growth; however, it also accelerated its 
lipid oxidation. The impregnation of Rosa damascena phenolics not only 
counterbalanced this negative effect, but led to a more than four-fold increase 
of the shelf life of sea bass, as compared to the untreated samples.

INTRODUCTION: Surgical fixation of distal diaphyseal femur fractures remains a 
major challenge in developing countries given limited availability of 
fluoroscopy. The Surgical Implant Generation Network (SIGN) Standard 
Intramedullary Nail and SIGN Fin Nail are two modalities developed to address 
this challenge; the Fin Nail additionally avoids needing to place proximal 
interlocking screws. While efficacy of the Standard Nail has been established, 
outcomes following fixation with the Fin Nail are unknown. In this study, we 
compare outcomes of distal diaphyseal femur fractures treated with each implant.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from 2012 to 2013 at a single 
tertiary-referral center in Tanzania. Skeletally mature patients with distal 
diaphyseal femur fractures treated with either retrograde SIGN Standard Nail or 
Fin Nail were included. Patients followed-up at 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks 
post-operatively. The primary outcome was all-cause reoperation. Secondary 
outcomes included infection, non-union, malalignment, quality of life (EQ-5D 
score), pain (VAS score), radiographic healing (RUST score), and function (pain 
with weight bearing, knee range of motion, and Squat and Smile score).
RESULTS: 74 (85%) of 85 enrolled patients completed the minimum 1-year 
follow-up. There was no difference in rate of reoperation (p = 1.00), infection 
(p = 1.00), limb length discrepancy (p = 0.47), non-union (p = 1.00), or coronal 
or sagittal malalignment (p = 1.00, p = 0.55 respectively) at 1 year. There was 
furthermore no difference in mean EQ-5D (p = 0.82), VAS pain score (p = 0.43), 
RUST score (p = 0.44), maximum knee flexion (p = 0.52) and extension (p = 1.00), 
or Squat and Smile function (p = 1.00) between cohorts at 1 year.
DISCUSSION: Outcomes associated with the SIGN Fin Nail are comparable to those 
associated with the SIGN Standard Intramedullary Nail at 1 year. The SIGN Fin 
Nail may be useful as an alternative to Standard locked IM nails for fixation of 
distal diaphyseal femur fractures.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of a structured multimodal behavioral 
intervention to change dietary behaviors, as well as self-efficacy and social 
support for engaging in healthier diets.
METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used to assign sites into intervention 
and comparison groups. Data were collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. 
The intervention group participated in Texercise Select, a 12-week lifestyle 
enhancement program. Multiple mixed-effects models were used to examine 
nutrition-related changes over time.
RESULTS: For the intervention group, significant improvements were observed for 
fast food consumption (P = .011), fruit/vegetable consumption (P = .008), water 
consumption (P = .009), and social support (P < .001) from baseline to 3 months. 
The magnitude of these improvements was significantly greater than changes in 
the comparison group.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings suggest the intervention's ability to 
improve diet-related outcomes among older adults; however, additional efforts 
are needed to maintain changes over longer periods.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of first-line gefitinib, 
erlotinib, afatinib, and osimertinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.
METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted to 
compare the relative efficacy of gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and osimertinib 
in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. To assess the cost-effectiveness of these treatments, a 
Markov model was developed from Dutch societal perspective. The model was based 
on the clinical studies included in the NMA. Incremental costs per life-year 
(LY) and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were estimated. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted.
RESULTS: Total discounted per patient costs for gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, 
and osimertinib were €65,889, €64,035, €69,418, and €131,997, and mean QALYs 
were 1.36, 1.39, 1.52, and 2.01 per patient, respectively. Erlotinib dominated 
gefitinib. Afatinib versus erlotinib yielded incremental costs of €27,058/LY and 
€41,504/QALY gained. Osimertinib resulted in €91,726/LY and €128,343/QALY gained 
compared to afatinib. PSA showed that gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and 
osimertinib had 13%, 19%, 43%, and 26% probability to be cost-effective at a 
threshold of €80,000/QALY. A price reduction of osimertinib of 30% is required 
for osimertinib to be cost-effective at a threshold of €80,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib has a better effectiveness compared to all other TKIs. 
However, at a Dutch threshold of €80,000/QALY, osimertinib appears not to be 
cost-effective.

The aim of the study was to assess the need for changes in spirometry reference 
values in the Polish population with time lapse, as the aftereffect of a radical 
socioeconomic overturn of the 1990. We retrospectively analyzed data files on 
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), vital capacity (VC), and forced VC (FVC) 
in healthy, never-smoking Caucasians (731 females and 327 males) obtained in in 
1993-1998. We assessed a discrepancy between the then measured values of these 
variables, on the one side, and the corresponding European Community for Steel 
and Coal (ECSC) predicted values or the current updated predicted values for the 
Polish population, on the other side. We found that those old measured values 
approximately corresponded to the ECSC reference, but they were appreciably 
lower than the current Polish reference values; the younger the subjects the 
greater the difference. The current Polish reference values of FVC were much
