PURPOSE: The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of ethical 
dilemmas in the end-of-life process in advanced cancer patients.
METHODS: We carried out a multicenter, cross-sectional, observational, 
prospective study in a cohort of cancer patients whose life expectancy was ≤ 6 
months. We recorded sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis of cancer, 
symptom burden, cognitive and functional status, emotional impact, and 
sociofamilial risk factors. The main outcome measure was the detection of 
ethical dilemmas, based on the following definition: conflict in decision-making 
during the end-of-life process that involves the need to choose between morally 
acceptable opposing options, where none is clearly preferable to another.
RESULTS: We included 324 patients (mean age, 69 years; 58% men). We identified 
117 dilemmas in 90 patients (27.8%). The dilemmas detected were as follows: (a) 
conflicts of information (adaptive denial, conspiracy of silence, information 
exceeding patient's desired limit), 15.7%; (b) discrepancies in proportionality 
(discussion on futility, rejection of treatment, withdrawal of life support 
measures), 16.7%; (c) unrealistic expectations about the outcome of clinical 
trials, 2.5%; and (d) request for euthanasia or medically assisted suicide, 
1.2%. We observed a greater prevalence of ethical dilemmas in men, in patients 
receiving active cancer treatment, and in patients with emotional distress (p < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ethical dilemmas during the end-of-life process 
in cancer patients is relevant. Most dilemmas were associated directly or 
indirectly with respect for patient autonomy. In this context, the communication 
skills of the health professionals and advanced care planning take on a key 
role.

Premature cardiovascular disease among the HIV-infected population is of great 
concern among clinicians. The increased life expectancy of HIV-infected 
individuals is mainly due to the early detection of infection and the advent of 
antiretroviral therapy. Once known as a deadly disease, HIV infection has 
transitioned into a chronic condition. Cardiovascular disease in this population 
is thought to progress early due to traditional and non-traditional risk 
factors. Early detection of subclinical atherosclerosis has become a center of 
focus in research as our complete understanding of this process it not yet well 
known. Advancements in cardiac computed tomography angiography has enabled the 
exploration of coronary artery disease by further evaluation of coronary 
stenosis and plaque analysis. An increase in cardiovascular event rates in this 
population is currently thought to be linked to antiretroviral therapy, 
Framingham risk factors, and HIV. We sought to present an updated comprehensive 
review of the available literature on HIV related to atherosclerosis and 
cardiovascular risk.

INTRODUCTION: Over the last decades, the number of elderly patients on dialysis 
has rapidly grown on account of increased life expectancy, improved care and 
reduced mortality rate. Therefore, cooperation between geriatricians and 
nephrologists has become mandatory for co-managing kidney disease in these 
patients. Based on renewed interest in home hemodialysis (HHD), elderly patients 
may benefit from not being transported from their home for therapy.
METHODS: Here, we report our experience with HHD involving three elderly 
patients who were followed-up over a 15-months period in a nursing home.
FINDINGS: Our experience demonstrates that hospitalization abruptly dropped from 
40 days to zero days, the need for erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) 
diminished, transportation-related costs for home treatments decreased, and 
quality of life (QoL) improved. This was confirmed by a questionnaire 
administered to our patients at the start and again after 6 months of HHD which 
evaluated the Physical Health Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Health 
Component Score (MCS).
DISCUSSION: Home hemodialysis may represent an important way to improve social, 
mental, and physical recovery, while also eliminating the cost of transportation 
and the discomfort of abandoning their "homes" and daily habits. Home 
hemodialysis is an effective alternative to in-center HD or peritoneal dialysis 
(PD) that should be offered to elderly patients when a home caregiver is not 
available, nonetheless, nursing assistance is required. Moreover, HHD allows 
patients to stay at home, thereby avoiding several weekly trips to the dialysis 
center, and may be useful in reducing infections, especially in times of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, as demonstrated by our experience.

A Review-Based Comparative Analysis of Health Care Delivery System in Nigeria 
and the United Kingdom.

Health Sciences, College of Medical Sciences, University of Maiduguri,

BACKGROUND: It is a general belief that the healthcare delivery system (HCDS) in 
Nigeria is bedevilled by frequent workers industrial actions, inter-professional 
rivalry among healthcare workers and insurance scheme mismanagement and 
corruption.
OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at comparing the health care system in Nigeria 
(a lower middle-income country) and the United Kingdom (a high-income country).
METHODS: Using keywords including 'primary health care', 'secondary health 
care', 'tertiary health care', 'health care delivery system', 'Nigeria' and 
''United Kingdom, PubMed was searched for studies on health care in Nigeria and 
the United Kingdom. Databases of the World Bank, World Health Organization, 
Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook and Index Mundi were also searched 
for information on health indices and organisational characteristics for Nigeria 
and the United Kingdom. Retrieved articles and data obtained were analysed and a 
two-country comparison was performed on HCDS features and health indices.
RESULTS: The average Life Expectancy in Nigeria is less than two third of that 
of the UK (54.8 years vs. 81.2 years) and the probability of dying between 15 
and 60 years per thousands of population is 127.8% higher among Nigerians than 
among UK citizens. The Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births and the 
under-five children mortality rate is 16 and 23 times higher in Nigeria than in 
the UK. The probability of dying on or before the first year of life and before 
the age of five is 177% and 183% higher respectively, in Nigeria than in the UK. 
While the UK ranked within the top 2% -10% on health system rating features such 
as achievement of goals, health care services distribution and overall goal 
achievement on HCDS, Nigeria is ranked within the bottom 2%-5% in these 
measures.
DISCUSSION: Using the HCDS in the UK as a model, it can be argued that a 
multi-faceted approach that includes attitudinal and behavioural changes among 
the healthcare workers, proactive health and social policy implementation and 
monitoring, preventive and corrective anti-corruption measures, population 
control and increased healthcare spending may be needed to address challenges 
and improve Nigeria's healthcare rating and ranking among countries.

An increase in life expectancy and the number of older and elderly men, an 
improvement in the quality of medical care and socio-economic factors in most 
countries contributed to an increase in the number of patients with benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Currently, improvement of the quality of life is 
the mainstay of strategy for managing patients with BPH, as well as prevention 
of complications and the need for surgery. In this regard, the pharmacotherapy 
with 1-adrenergic blockers (1-AB) is widely used as an effective method for 
improving lower urinary tract symptoms and reducing the risk of BPH progression. 
Given that the quality of life is becoming increasingly important in evaluating 
the efficiency of BPH treatment, including therapy in elderly patients, it is 
necessary to take into account its effect on sexual function, when choosing a 
particular drug. The use of 1-AB can be accompanied by side effects manifested 
by various sexual disorders. Alfuzosin does not adversely affect sexual function 
in men with BPH, may improve erectile and ejaculatory function and should be 
considered as the drug of choice, especially in sexually active men and patients 
who already suffer from worsening ejaculatory function while using another 1-AB.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a polyetiological nosology. Its symptoms are often 
characterized not only with detrusor hyperactivity, but also with the increased 
sensitivity of afferent fibers, which is clinically manifested as urgency. In 
addition, the disorders at the level of receptors expression and the synthesis 
of mediators lead to the development of bladder pain syndrome (BPS), which also 
significantly reduces the quality of life of patients. In recent years, the 
experimental animal studies achieved significant progress in understanding of 
the pathogenesis of lower urinary tract dysfunction. In particular, the broad 
understanding of the sensor properties of urothelium was obtained, which 
significantly increased the popularity of the urothelial theory of the 
development of idiopathic detrusor hyperactivity, as well as hypersensitivity 
and bladder pain. According to this theory, the pathological release of 
biologically active substance in the transitional epithelium in response to an 
extension of the bladder wall leads to clinical manifestations of the described 
conditions. In addition, due to the studies of the properties of receptors, ion 
channels, and mediators, the suggestion about the reduced efficiency of 
muscarinic receptor antagonists have been made in a large number of patients. 
Besides the acetylcholine control of the lower urinary tract, more and more 
attention is paid to other significant mechanisms of pathological conditions. 
The purpose of this part of the lecture is to systematize the available 
materials of basic research on the functioning of the lower urinary tract at the 
cellular level, as well as the mechanisms of action and questions of the 
effectiveness of pharmacological therapy for urinary disorders.

The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate psychometric properties of 
the PrEP Sexual Expectancies Scale (PSEXS). The PSEXS represents a range of 
expectations for how PrEP use will affect one's sexual experience. The scale was 
developed to understand perceived reinforcements of PrEP use among men who have 
sex with men (MSM), including sexual risk-taking. The study builds upon 
Expectancy Theory to develop a measure of sex-related PrEP expectancies with a 
representative sample of 1155 MSM participants from Ukraine and 408 MSM 
participants from the U.S. Expectancy items represented two domains: increased 
sexual risk-taking and enhancement of sexual experience. Confirmatory analyses 
showed that a two-factor model provided a good fit to the data. The PSEXS scale 
had a high internal reliability in both samples (Ukraine α = 0.88, U.S. 
α = 0.83), and the identified factor structure explains a large amount of 
variance in both samples. Recent studies suggest that expectations of intimacy 
and better sexual experience can be a significant deciding factor for PrEP 
uptake. The PSEXS provides researchers with a useful measure for examining MSM's 
expectancy beliefs about the impact of PrEP use on their sexual life.

BACKGROUND: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) improves short-term outcomes for 
ulcerative colitis (UC) patients hospitalized for acute flares. Longer-term 
impacts and cost-effectiveness are unknown.
METHODS: We compared disease outcomes and cost-effectiveness of HBOT in addition 
to standard of care versus standard of care alone for UC patients hospitalized 
for acute flares using a microsimulation model. Published literature was used 
for transition probabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
estimates. We modeled 100,000 individuals in each group over a 5-year horizon 
and compared rates of re-hospitalization, rescue medical therapy, colectomy, 
death, and cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed with 500 samples and 250 
trials, in addition to multiple microsimulation sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The use of HBOT at the time of index hospitalization for an acute UC 
flare is projected to reduce the risk of re-hospitalization, inpatient rescue 
medical therapy, and inpatient emergent colectomy by over 60% (p < 0.001) and 
mortality by over 30% (p <0.001), during a 5-year horizon. The HBOT strategy 
costs more ($5600 incremental cost) but also yielded higher QALYs (0.13 
incremental yield), resulting in this strategy being cost-effective 
($43,000/QALY). Results were sensitive to HBOT costs and rates of endoscopic 
improvement with HBOT. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses observed HBOT to be 
more cost-effective than standard of care in 95% of iterations.
CONCLUSION: The use of HBOT to optimize response to steroids during the index 
hospitalization for an acute UC flare is cost-effective and is projected to 
result in significant reductions in disease-related complications in the long 
term.

BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) supports individuals to define, discuss, 
and record goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care. Despite 
being internationally recommended, randomised clinical trials of ACP in patients 
with advanced cancer are scarce.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: To test the implementation of ACP in patients with 
advanced cancer, we conducted a cluster-randomised trial in 23 hospitals across 
Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Slovenia, and United Kingdom in 2015-2018. 
Patients with advanced lung (stage III/IV) or colorectal (stage IV) cancer, WHO 
performance status 0-3, and at least 3 months life expectancy were eligible. The 
ACTION Respecting Choices ACP intervention as offered to patients in the 
intervention arm included scripted ACP conversations between patients, family 
members, and certified facilitators; standardised leaflets; and standardised 
advance directives. Control patients received care as usual. Main outcome 
measures were quality of life (operationalised as European Organisation for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] emotional functioning) and symptoms. 
Secondary outcomes were coping, patient satisfaction, shared decision-making, 
patient involvement in decision-making, inclusion of advance directives (ADs) in 
hospital files, and use of hospital care. In all, 1,117 patients were included 
(442 intervention; 675 control), and 809 (72%) completed the 12-week 
questionnaire. Patients' age ranged from 18 to 91 years, with a mean of 66; 39% 
were female. The mean number of ACP conversations per patient was 1.3. Fidelity 
was 86%. Sixteen percent of patients found ACP conversations distressing. Mean 
change in patients' quality of life did not differ between intervention and 
control groups (T-score -1.8 versus -0.8, p = 0.59), nor did changes in 
symptoms, coping, patient satisfaction, and shared decision-making. Specialist 
palliative care (37% versus 27%, p = 0.002) and AD inclusion in hospital files 
(10% versus 3%, p < 0.001) were more likely in the intervention group. A key 
limitation of the study is that recruitment rates were lower in intervention 
than in control hospitals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that quality of life effects were not different 
between patients who had ACP conversations and those who received usual care. 
The increased use of specialist palliative care and AD inclusion in hospital 
files of intervention patients is meaningful and requires further study. Our 
findings suggest that alternative approaches to support patient-centred 
end-of-life care in this population are needed.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a program intended to reduce 
intrapartum and neonatal mortality in Accra, Ghana.
DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, time-sequence intervention, retrospective 
cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: A program integrating leadership development, clinical skills and 
quality improvement training was piloted at the Greater Accra Regional Hospital 
from 2013 to 2016. The number of intrapartum and neonatal deaths prevented were 
estimated using the hospital's 2012 stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates as a 
steady-state assumption. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was 
calculated as cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. In order to 
test the assumptions included in this analysis, it was subjected to 
probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which 
measures the cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted by the intervention 
compared to status quo.
RESULTS: From 2012 to 2016, there were 45,495 births at the Greater Accra 
Regional Hospital, of whom 5,734 were admitted to the newborn intensive care 
unit. The budget for the systems strengthening program was US $1,716,976. Based 
on program estimates, 307 (±82) neonatal deaths and 84 (±35) stillbirths were 
prevented, amounting to 12,342 DALYs averted. The systems strengthening 
intervention was found to be highly cost effective with an ICER of US $139 
(±$44), an amount significantly lower than the established threshold of 
cost-effectiveness of the per capita gross domestic product, which averaged US 
$1,649 between 2012-2016. The results were found to be sensitive to the 
following parameters: DALYs averted, number of neonatal deaths, and number of 
stillbirths.
CONCLUSION: An integrated approach to system strengthening in referral hospitals 
has the potential to reduce neonatal and intrapartum mortality in low resource 
settings and is likely to be cost-effective. Sustained change can be achieved by 
building organizational capacity through leadership and clinical training.

Heat waves are known for their disastrous mass die-off effects due to 
dehydration and cell damage, but little is known about the non-lethal 
consequences of surviving severe heat exposure. Severe heat exposure can cause 
oxidative stress which can have negative consequences on animal cognition, 
reproduction and life expectancy. We investigated the current oxidative stress 
experienced by a mesic mouse species, the four striped field mouse, Rhabdomys 
dilectus through a heat wave simulation with ad lib water and a more severe 
temperature exposure with minimal water. Wild four striped field mice were 
caught between 2017 and 2019. We predicted that wild four striped field mice in 
the heat wave simulation would show less susceptibility to oxidative stress as 
compared to a more severe heat stress which is likely to occur in the future. 
Oxidative stress was determined in the liver, kidney and brain using 
malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PC) as markers for oxidative damage, 
and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as markers 
of antioxidant defense. Incubator heat stress was brought about by increasing 
the body temperatures of animals to 39-40.8°C for 6 hours. A heat wave (one hot 
day, followed by a 3-day heatwave) was simulated by using temperature cycle that 
wild four striped field mice would experience in their local habitat (determined 
through weather station data using temperature and humidity), with maximal 
ambient temperature of 39°C. The liver and kidney demonstrated no changes in the 
simulated heat wave, but the liver had significantly higher SOD activity and the 
kidney had significantly higher lipid peroxidation in the incubator experiment. 
Dehydration significantly contributed to the increase of these markers, as is 
evident from the decrease in body mass after the experiment. The brain only 
showed significantly higher lipid peroxidation following the simulated heat wave 
with no significant changes following the incubator experiment. The significant 
increase in lipid peroxidation was not correlated to body mass after the 
experiment. The magnitude and duration of heat stress, in conjunction with 
dehydration, played a critical role in the oxidative stress experienced by each 
tissue, with the results demonstrating the importance of measuring multiple 
tissues to determine the physiological state of an animal. Current heat waves in 
this species have the potential of causing oxidative stress in the brain with 
future heat waves to possibly stress the kidney and liver depending on the 
hydration state of animals.

Land oil spills in Nigeria have a long history of contaminating the soil, 
groundwater, vegetation, and streams with spill extension being the primary of 
numerous ordeals. These have left the host communities of oil fields and 
pipelines in crucial need of soil rehabilitation. Thus, this review provides 
insights into the current state of land oil spills and the effectiveness of 
on-site remediation approaches across communities. A total of 44 incidents of 
land oil spills of ≥ 500 bbl, amounting to 53,631 bbl between 2011 and 2019, was 
recorded by the Shell Petroleum Development Company, which primarily attributed 
to 83% of the total sabotage. Over 73% of the 53,631 bbl spills were unrecovered 
from the spill areas, which had deleterious impacts on farmlands, fishponds, 
rivers, and residential areas. Remediation by enhanced natural attenuation 
(RENA) is a feasible technique for restoring petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated 
sites, but it might be ineffective when limited to tiling, windrows, and 
fertilizer applications due to the presence of non-biodegradable residues and 
contaminants beyond the aeration depth. However, bioremediation techniques 
ranging from non-supplemented in-situ and fertilizer supplemented in-situ to 
mixed in-situ and ex-situ bio-cells supplemented RENA are feasible approaches 
for spill sites. However, challenging limitations with regard to RENA 
application failures in the region include delayed responses to spill emergency, 
large amounts of un-recovered spilled oil, and un-implemented legislative 
guidelines for spill cleanup. Nevertheless, the temperature, moisture, nutrient, 
oxygen, and pH of the soil are essential parameters to be considered when 
implementing a landfarming remediation approach.

BACKGROUND: The heterogeneous nature of cancer necessitates subtyping of cancer 
patients into distinct and well separated subgroups. However, computational 
issues arise because gene expression data is noisy and contains outliers apart 
from being high dimensional. As such, an attempt to subtype cancer patients from 
gene expression data leads to highly overlapping Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival 
plots and thus clear distinction among the discovered subtypes becomes 
difficult. Here we attempt to achieve a greater separation among the subtypes 
through a robust clustering pipeline.
METHODS: We propose a robust framework to achieve a better separation among the 
discovered subtypes. Our framework is based on dimensionality reduction of a 
weighted gene expression matrix using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor 
Embedding (t-SNE) and a robust Gaussian mixture model based clustering approach. 
Every gene is weighted according to the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the 
gene before dimensionality reduction. The results are quantified by measuring 
the minimum pairwise separation among the KM plots and minimum hazard ratio 
among the subtypes. We also introduce a novel method, called cumulative survival 
separation, to quantify the separation among the discovered subtypes.
RESULTS: To validate the proposed methodology we obtained five cancer gene 
expression datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and comparisons with 
Consensus Clustering (CC), Consensus non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF), 
fast density-aware spectral clustering (Spectrum) and Neighborhood based 
Multi-Omics clustering (NEMO) methodologies show that the proposed method is 
able to achieve a greater separation compared to the aforementioned methods in 
literature. For instance, the minimum pairwise life expectancy difference (in 
days) between the discovered subtypes for GBM is 61 days for the proposed 
methodology with MAD scores, whereas it is approximately 33, 19, 49 and 33 days 
only for CC, Spectrum, Nemo and CNMF respectively. Comparisons are also shown 
for the proposed framework with and without using the MAD scores and it is 
observed that MAD score significantly improves the subtype separation. Hazard 
ratio analysis also shows that the proposed methodology performs better. 
Furthermore, pathway over-representation analyses were carried to identify 
relevant genetic pathways which can be possible targets for treatment.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the use of median absolute deviation and a 
robust clustering methodology are helpful in achieving greater separation among 
the subtypes with better statistical and clinical significance.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP) commonly present with 
increased trunk muscle fatigability; typically assessed as reduced time to task 
failure during non-functional isometric contractions. Less is known about the 
specific neuromuscular responses of individuals with CLBP during dynamic 
fatiguing tasks. We investigate the regional alteration in muscle activation and 
peak torque exertion during a dynamic isokinetic fatiguing task in individuals 
with and without CLBP.
METHODS: Electromyography (EMG) was acquired from the lumbar erector spinae 
unilaterally of 11 asymptomatic controls and 12 individuals with CLBP, using 
high-density EMG (13 × 5 grid of electrodes). Seated in an isokinetic 
dynamometer, participants performed continuous cyclic trunk flexion-extension at 
60o/s until volitional exhaustion.
FINDINGS: Similar levels of muscle activation and number of repetitions were 
observed for both groups (p > 0.05). However, the CLBP group exerted lower 
levels of peak torque for both flexion and extension moments (p < 0.05). The 
centre of lumbar erector spinae activity was shifted cranially in the CLBP group 
throughout the task (p < 0.05), while the control participants showed a more 
homogenous distribution of muscle activity.
INTERPRETATION: People with CLBP displayed altered and potentially less 
efficient activation of their lumbar erector spinae during a dynamic fatiguing 
task. Future studies should consider using high-density EMG biofeedback to 
optimise the spatial activation of the paraspinal musculature in people with low 
back pain (LBP).

BACKGROUND: It is unknown, whether metastatic prostate cancer (CaP) patients 
with intermediate life expectancy (5-10 years) should be considered for external 
beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the prostate. We addressed this void.
METHODS: Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database 
(2004-2016), we identified 835 M1a or M1b CaP substaged patients with 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20 ng/ml and with intermediate life expectancy 
(LE) 5 to 10 years, treated with EBRT or no EBRT. Inverse probability of 
treatment-weighting (IPTW), Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox-regression models (CRMs) 
were used.
RESULTS: Overall, 179 (21.4%) patients received EBRT and 656 (78.6%) did not. 
EBRT rates increased from 13.9 to 23.8% (2004-2016; P= 0.04). After 
IPTW-adjustment, median OS was 45 vs. 35 months, in EBRT vs. no EBRT patients (P 
< 0.001). In IPTW-adjusted Cox-regression models, EBRT independently predicted 
lower overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.7, CI 0.61-0.89; P= 0.001). After 
stratification according to M1 substages, EBRT was associated with lower overall 
mortality in M1a (HR: 0.2, CI 0.05-0.91; P= 0.03) and M1b (HR: 0.7, CI 
0.55-0.88; P = 0.003) substages.
CONCLUSION: EBRT was associated with lower mortality in metastatic CaP patients 
with low PSA and intermediate LE (5-10 years). In consequence, greater 
consideration for EBRT should be given in those patients. However, it is 
important to consider study limitations until clinical trials confirm the 
proposed benefit.

Over the past 60 years, haematologists and scientists from the United Kingdom, 
notably John Goldman and Tessa Holyoake, have punched above their weight in 
changing chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) from an incurable and invariably fatal 
disease for all, to a chronic condition where over 90% have normal life 
expectancy. As a result, it is now difficult to power a worthwhile phase 3 study 
for newly diagnosed patients. Nevertheless, important clinical questions remain.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of decentralised diagnostic 
programme for hepatitis B virus (HBV) implemented in Tamil Nadu, South India 
with specific focus on a selected key population at increased risk of HBV.
METHODS: A combination of decision tree and Markov model was developed to 
compare cost-effectiveness of the new and standard strategy. Cost and health 
outcomes were calculated based on the proportion of cohort in each respective 
health state. Total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the intervention and comparator strategies 
were calculated. The model parameter uncertainties were evaluated by sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: Considering decentralised HBV diagnosis followed by early treatment and 
vaccination for negatives for a cohort of 1000 population resulted in 505 QALYs 
gained and incremental cost-saving of 180749 ($2620). The decentralised 
diagnostic strategy could avert 294 deaths, gain 293 life years and reduce 
out-of-pocket expenditure of 3274 ($47) per person for HBV management.
CONCLUSION: Decentralised HBV diagnosis followed by early treatment and 
vaccination for negatives in Tamil Nadu can save lives and reduce out-of-pocket 
expenditures compared to standard strategy.

Publisher: OBJECTIF: Evaluer le rapport coût-efficacité du programme de 
diagnostic décentralisé du virus de l'hépatite B (VHB) mis en œuvre au Tamil 
Nadu, dans le sud de l'Inde, avec un accent particulier sur une population clé 
sélectionnée à risque accru du VHB. MÉTHODES: Une combinaison d'arbre de 
décision et de modèle de Markov a été développée pour comparer la rentabilité de 
la stratégie nouvelle et standard. Les coûts et les résultats pour la santé ont 
été calculés sur base de la proportion de la cohorte dans chaque état de santé 
respectif. Les coûts totaux, les années de vie corrigées de la qualité (QALY), 
le rapport coût-efficacité supplémentaire de l'intervention et les stratégies de 
comparaison ont été calculés. Les incertitudes des paramètres du modèle ont été 
évaluées par analyse de sensibilité. RÉSULTATS: La prise en compte d'un 
diagnostic décentralisé du VHB suivi d'un traitement précoce et d'une 
vaccination des cas négatifs pour une cohorte de 1000 habitants a permis de 
gagner 505 QALY et d'économiser des coûts supplémentaires de ₹180.749 (2.620 
USD). La stratégie de diagnostic décentralisée pourrait éviter 294 décès, gagner 
293 années de vie et réduire les dépenses personnelles de ₹3274 (47 USD) par 
personne pour la prise en charge du VHB.
CONCLUSION: Le diagnostic décentralisé du VHB suivi d'un traitement précoce et 
de la vaccination des cas négatifs au Tamil Nadu peut sauver des vies et réduire 
les dépenses personnelles par rapport à la stratégie standard.

As life expectancy increases and birth rates decline, the geriatric population 
continues to grow faster than any other age group. Aging is characterized by a 
progressive physiologic decline that promotes the onset of functional limitation 
and disability. With the increasing geriatric population, more elderly patients 
are presenting to emergency departments after trauma, and intensive care units 
are being met with increasing demand. Rehabilitation is critical in improving 
quality of life by maximizing physical, cognitive, and psychological recovery 
from injury or disease.

INTRODUCTION: People with Down syndrome have health risks that require specific 
lifelong preventive health care. With increasing life expectancy, people with 
Down syndrome also face health conditions typical of their unaffected peers and 
thus need coordinated health care. The purpose of this study is to describe 
rates of age/sex- and Down syndrome-specific preventive healthcare activities 
among adolescents and adults with Down syndrome.
METHODS: Using Medicaid claims (2006-2010) in California, Colorado, Michigan, 
and Pennsylvania, the cohort was defined as people with Down syndrome aged ≥12 
years seen by primary care providers and enrolled in Medicaid for ≥45 of 60 
months without dual Medicare enrollment (n=3,501). Age focus-consistent primary 
care providers were defined as having a focus concordant with a patient's age: 
12-17 years, child or mixed-focus; ≥26 years, adult or mixed-focus; 18-25 years, 
any focus. Differences in healthcare activities were evaluated using Pearson's 
chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Analyses were performed in 
2015-2017.
RESULTS: Of the cohort, 79% had an age focus-consistent primary care provider. 
However, 40% of adults aged ≥26 years received care from a child-focused primary 
care provider. Only 43% with an age focus-consistent provider had ≥1 well 
examination (age focus-inconsistent primary care provider: 35%, p<0.001). Most 
preventive activities had poor rates (<50%) regardless of age focus consistency 
between provider and patient age or whether they were age/sex- or Down 
syndrome-specific (well examinations; vaccinations; sleep apnea; hearing; and 
breast, cervical, and colon cancer screenings). Lipids, vision, and thyroid 
screenings reached moderate levels (50% to <80%).
CONCLUSIONS: Rates of age/sex- and Down syndrome-specific preventive 
recommendations were low among adolescents and adults with Down syndrome, 
regardless of the age focus consistency of their primary care provider. This 
represents a significant opportunity to improve primary care in this vulnerable 
population.

BACKGROUND: In pemphigus, elucidating the disease-causing immune mechanism and 
developing new therapeutic strategies are needed. In this context, the second 
messenger 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is gaining attention. cAMP 
is important in hematological and auto-inflammatory disorders. A class of 
enzymes called phosphodiesterases (PDEs) control intracellular cAMP levels. In 
pemphigus, cAMP levels increase following IgG binding to Dsg3. This appears to 
be a mechanism to preserve epithelial integrity.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether apremilast, an inhibitor of the PDE4 normally 
used in psoriasis, may be of benefit in the blistering skin disorder pemphigus.
METHODS: Here we report of a 62 years old patient with chronic debilitating and
