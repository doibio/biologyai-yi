results of comparisons of risk-tailored CRC screening with no screening, and 
supported that risk-tailored screening was cost-effective. All of seven studies 
reported the ICERs of risk-tailored screening and age-based screening. 
Disparities in the discrimination of risk-prediction tool, accuracy of adopted 
techniques, uptake rate of screening and cost estimation impacted the 
cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies on the economic evaluation of risk-tailored CRC screening 
are limited, and current evidence is not sufficient to support the replacement 
of risk-tailored screening for traditional age-based screening.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an often fatal condition, the primary 
pathology of which involves loss of pulmonary vascular perfusion due to 
progressive aberrant vessel remodeling. The reduced capacity of the pulmonary 
circulation places increasing strain on the right ventricle of the heart, 
leading to death by heart failure. Currently, licensed therapies are primarily 
vasodilators, which have increased the median post-diagnosis life expectancy 
from 2.8 to 7 years. Although this represents a substantial improvement, the 
search continues for transformative therapeutics that reverse established 
disease. The genetics of human PAH heavily implicates reduced endothelial bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling as a causal role for the disease 
pathobiology. Recent approaches have focused on directly enhancing BMP signaling 
or removing the inhibitory influence of pathways that repress BMP signaling. In 
this critical commentary, we review the evidence underpinning the development of 
two approaches: BMP-based agonists and inhibition of activin/GDF signaling. We 
also address the key considerations and questions that remain regarding these 
approaches.

BACKGROUND: Existing evidence suggest the emergence of palliative care (PC) 
services in the emergency department (ED). To gain insight into the nature of 
these services and provide direction to future actions, there is a need for a 
comprehensive review that ascertains the components of these services, 
integration models, and outcomes.
METHODS: A scoping review design was employed and reported according to the 
PRISMA extension guidelines for scoping reviews. Extensive searches in 
peer-reviewed databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Medline) 
and gray literature sources (Trove, MedNar, OpenGrey, and the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality) were undertaken and supplemented with hand 
searching. Titles, abstracts, and full text were reviewed in duplicate. Studies 
were eligible for inclusion if they reported on a PC intervention implemented in 
the ED for adults. Codes were formulated across the included studies, which 
facilitated the conduct of a narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were retained with the majority (n = 15) emerging 
from the United States. The components of PC interventions in the ED were 
categorized as: (1) screening, (2) goals of care discussion and communication, 
(3) managing pain and other distressing symptoms in the ED, (4) transitions 
across care settings, (5) end-of-life (EoL) care, (6) family/caregiver support, 
and (7) ED staff education. Traditional PC consultations and integrated ED-PC 
services were the main modes of delivery. PC in the ED can potentially improve 
patient symptoms, facilitate access to relevant services, reduce length of stay, 
improve care at the EoL, facilitate bereavement and postbereavement support for 
family members, and improve ED staff confidence in delivering PC.
CONCLUSIONS: PC implementation in the ED may potentially improve patient and 
family outcomes. More studies are needed, however, to standardize trigger or 
screening tools. More prospective studies are also needed to test PC 
interventions in the ED.

BACKGROUND: Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) which is the most common 
carcinoma of the respiratory system after lung carcinomas is graded by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) into three groups as grades 1, 2, and 3. This system 
does not correlate with the prognosis and has a low reproducibility among the 
pathologists. Searching for a new grading system, in this study, we investigated 
the relationship between tumor budding and histomorphological parameters and 
survival status. We examined the new grading system based on cell nest size and 
tumor budding.
METHODS: Partial and total laryngectomy materials of 130 patients diagnosed as 
laryngeal SCC between 2012 and 2018 in our clinic were evaluated retrospectively 
by two pathologists. Tumor budding activity and cell nests were scored and a new 
score was obtained by summing the scores. According to the scores obtained, a 
new grading system was created.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the tumor 
budding activity and the overall and disease-free survival times of the groups. 
The overall and disease-free survival time of the patients with high tumor 
budding significantly reduced. Tumor budding was found to be low in the presence 
of an intense lymphocytic host response (P < 0.05). There was no relationship 
between the new grade system and cell nest size and life expectancy (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor budding provides significant clues in predicting the life 
expectancy of the patients. Therefore, tumor budding might be a component of new 
grading systems and should take place in pathology reports.

IMPORTANCE: Improvements in control of factors associated with diabetes risk in 
the US have stalled and remain suboptimal. The benefit of continually improving 
goal achievement has not been evaluated to date.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify potential gains in life expectancy (LE) among people with 
type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated with lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 
systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and 
body mass index (BMI) toward optimal levels.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this decision analytical model, the 
Building, Relating, Assessing, and Validating Outcomes (BRAVO) diabetes 
microsimulation model was calibrated to a nationally representative sample of 
adults with T2D from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(2015-2016) using their linked short-term mortality data from the National Death 
Index. The model was then used to conduct the simulation experiment on the study 
population over a lifetime. Data were analyzed from January to October 2021.
EXPOSURE: The study population was grouped into quartiles on the basis of levels 
of HbA1c, SBP, LDL-C, and BMI. LE gains associated with achieving better control 
were estimated by moving people with T2D from the current quartile of each 
biomarker to the lower quartiles.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life expectancy.
RESULTS: Among 421 individuals, 194 (46%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 
65.6 (8.9) years. Compared with a BMI of 41.4 (mean of the fourth quartile), 
lower BMIs of 24.3 (first), 28.6 (second), and 33.0 (third) were associated with 
3.9, 2.9, and 2.0 additional life-years, respectively, in people with T2D. 
Compared with an SBP of 160.4 mm Hg (fourth), lower SBP levels of 114.1 mm Hg 
(first), 128.2 mm Hg (second), and 139.1 mm Hg (third) were associated with 1.9, 
1.5, and 1.1 years gained in LE in people with T2D, respectively. A lower LDL-C 
level of 59 mg/dL (first), 84.0 mg/dL (second), and 107.0 mg/dL (third) were 
associated with 0.9, 0.7, and 0.5 years gain in LE, compared with LDL-C of 146.2 
mg/dL (fourth). Reducing HbA1c from 9.9% (fourth) to 7.7% (third) was associated 
with 3.4 years gain in LE. However, a further reduction to 6.8% (second) was 
associated with only a mean of 0.5 years gain in LE, and from 6.8% to 5.9% 
(first) was not associated with LE benefit. Overall, reducing HbA1c from the 
fourth quartile to the first is associated with an LE gain of 3.8 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings can be used by clinicians to motivate 
patients in achieving the recommended treatment goals and to help prioritize 
interventions and programs to improve diabetes care in the US.

CONTEXT: Thyroid nodules' size should not be the sole criterion for 
thyroidectomy; however, many patients undergo surgery for large or slowly 
growing nodules.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated risk for clinically significant thyroid cancer in 
patients with large or slowly growing nodules.
METHODS: We reviewed data from 2 prospectively collected databases of patients 
undergoing thyroidectomies in tertiary referral centers in the USA and Greece 
over 14 consecutive years. We collected data on the preoperative surgical 
indication, FNA cytology, and surgical pathology. We included subjects operated 
solely for large or growing thyroid nodules, without any known or presumed 
thyroid cancer or high risk for malignancy, family history of thyroid cancer, or 
prior radiation exposure.
RESULTS: We reviewed 5523 consecutive cases (USA: 2711; Greece: 2812). After 
excluding 3059 subjects, we included 2464 subjects in the present analysis. 
Overall, 533 thyroid cancers were identified (21.3%): 372 (69.8%) 
microcarcinomas (<1 cm) and 161 (30.2%) macrocarcinomas (≥1 cm). The histology 
was consistent with papillary cancer (n = 503), follicular cancer (n = 12), 
Hürthle cell cancer (n = 9), medullary cancer (n = 5), and mixed histology 
cancers n = 4. Only 47 (1.9%) of our subjects had any form of thyroid cancer in 
the nodule that originally led to surgery. The cancers were multifocal in 165 
subjects; had extrathyroidal extension in 61, capsular invasion in 80, lymph 
node involvement in 35, and bone metastasis in 2 subjects.
CONCLUSION: The risk of synchronous, clinically important thyroid cancers is 
small, but not null in patients with large or slow growing thyroid nodules. 
Therefore, more precise preoperative evaluation is needed to separate the 
patients who would clearly benefit from thyroid surgery from the vast majority 
of those who do not need to be operated.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been proven effective 
against cervical cancer. However, HPV vaccination is not included in the Chinese 
immunization program. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
incorporating different HPV vaccines into immunization programs at the Chinese 
national and provincial levels.
METHODS: The Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modeling and Economics model was 
used to estimate the possible cost and social and economic benefits of adopting 
various HPV vaccination immunization strategies in 31 provinces in Mainland 
China in 2019. Demographic and regional economic data were obtained from the 
national and provincial Statistical Yearbook. The cost of vaccines was gathered 
from the centralized procurement information platform of all Chinese provinces. 
Treatment costs, epidemiological data, and other model parameters were obtained 
from published literature. The cost of vaccination, treatment costs saved, net 
costs, cases and deaths averted, life years saved, disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) prevented, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
predicted both provincially and nationally. Deterministic sensitivity analyses 
were used to explore model uncertainty.
RESULTS: The net cost of vaccinating with the domestic bivalent HPV vaccine was 
the lowest. At the national level, after bivalent or quadrivalent HPV 
vaccination, the number of cases and deaths averted due to cervical cancer were 
12,545 and 5109, respectively, whereas the 9-valent HPV vaccine averted 28,140 
cases and 11,459 deaths. HPV vaccines were cost-effective at a national level 
(maximum cost US$ 18,165 per DALY gained.) compared to the 3 times GDP per 
capita (US$ 30,837). Bivalent HPV vaccines were cost-effective in all 31 
provinces. Imported quadrivalent and 9-valent HPV vaccines were cost-effective 
in 29 provinces, except Heilongjiang and Gansu. The univariate sensitivity 
analysis showed that the results were robust when the model parameters were 
changed, and that the discount rate was the main factor affecting the baseline 
results.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the inclusion of HPV vaccination 
in the immunization program would be cost-effective at a national level and in 
most provinces. Provinces with a higher population have more prevented cases, 
deaths, and DALYs. The economics of HPV vaccination at the provincial level 
differs from that at the national level, and provinces with an inability to pay 
should seek help from state subsidies.

BACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysm (AA) is a global public health concern. However, 
little is known about the disease burden of AA in China.
METHODS: Following the general analytic strategy used in the Global Burden of 
Disease Study (GBD) 2019, we analyzed the mortality and years of life lost 
(YLLs) due to AA, stratified by sex, age, and province-level region in China 
from 1990 to 2019. The temporal trend of AA burden in China was analyzed and the 
main attributable risk factors for AA in China were also explored.
RESULTS: In China, the total AA deaths were 17,038 (95% UI: 14,392-19,980) in 
2019, an increase of 136.1% compared with that in 1990, with an age-standardized 
death rate (ASDR) of 0.93 (95% UI: 0.79-1.08) per 100,000 person-years in 2019, 
a decrease of 6.8%. Meanwhile AA caused 378,578 (95% UI: 315,980-450,479) YLLs 
in 2019, an increase of 102.6% compared with that in 1990, with a crude YLL rate 
of 26.6 (95% UI: 22.2-31.7) per 100,000 person-years, an increase of 68.6%. The 
AA mortality and YLLs were higher in males than in females. AA caused most YLLs 
in the 65- to 75-year-old age group. The AA mortality and YLLs varied 
significantly among provinces in China, and the change in ASDR showed a negative 
correlation with the sociodemographic index of different provinces, namely, more 
decline of ASDR in developed provinces. High systolic blood pressure was shown 
to be the most significant attributable risk factor for AA burden in both males 
and females, and smoking was another major attributable risk factor, especially 
in males.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of AA increased significantly from 1990 to 2019 
in China, with higher mortality and YLLs in males, senior populations, and among 
residents of most western provinces in China. High systolic blood pressure and 
smoking were two major attributable risk factors for AA mortality in China.

RecQ helicases-also known as the "guardians of the genome"-play crucial roles in 
genome integrity maintenance through their involvement in various DNA metabolic 
pathways. Aside from being conserved from bacteria to vertebrates, their 
importance is also reflected in the fact that in humans impaired function of 
multiple RecQ helicase orthologs are known to cause severe sets of problems, 
including Bloom, Werner, or Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. Our aim was to create 
and characterize a zebrafish (Danio rerio) disease model for Bloom syndrome, a 
recessive autosomal disorder. In humans, this syndrome is characterized by short 
stature, skin rashes, reduced fertility, increased risk of carcinogenesis, and 
shortened life expectancy brought on by genomic instability. We show that 
zebrafish blm mutants recapitulate major hallmarks of the human disease, such as 
shortened lifespan and reduced fertility. Moreover, similarly to other factors 
involved in DNA repair, some functions of zebrafish Blm bear additional 
importance in germ line development, and consequently in sex differentiation. 
Unlike fanc genes and rad51, however, blm appears to affect its function 
independent of tp53. Therefore, our model will be a valuable tool for further 
understanding the developmental and molecular attributes of this rare disease, 
along with providing novel insights into the role of genome maintenance proteins 
in somatic DNA repair and fertility.

Spinal metastasis: narrative reviews of the current evidence and treatment 
modalities.

The treatment for spinal metastasis has evolved significantly during the past 
decade. An advancement in systemic therapy has led to a prolonged overall 
survival in cancer patients, thus increasing the incidence of spinal metastasis. 
In addition, with the improved treatment armamentarium, the prediction of 
patient survival using traditional prognostic models may have limitations and 
these require the incorporation of some novel parameters to improve their 
prognostic accuracy. The development of minimally-invasive spinal procedures and 
minimal access surgical techniques have facilitated a quicker patient recovery 
and return to systemic treatment. These modern interventions help to alleviate 
pain and improve quality of life, even in candidates with a relatively short 
life expectancy. Radiotherapy may be considered in non-surgical candidates or as 
adjuvant therapy for improving local tumour control. Stereotactic radiosurgery 
has facilitated this even in radioresistant tumours and may even replace surgery 
in radiosensitive malignancies. This narrative review summarizes the current 
evidence leading to the paradigm shifts in the modern treatment of spinal 
metastasis.

University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.

BACKGROUND: The QUAZAR AML-001 trial (NCT01757535) showed survival benefits with 
the maintenance treatment of oral azacitidine(CC-486) for acute myeloid 
leukemia(AML) in first complete remission. We conducted a cost-effectiveness 
analysis to explore the costs and benefits of oral azacitidine in AML.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to evaluate the economic value of oral 
azacitidine. The time horizon was 10-years. The health utility scores and until 
prices of medical costs were acquired from previous studies and GoodRX. The 
transition probabilities were derived from the survival curves of the QUAZAR 
AML-001 study. Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Compared with placebo, oral azacitidine improved 0.39 QALY, with an 
increasing cost of $458,928.66. The ICER of oral azacitidine is 
$1,176,740.15(P < 0.05). Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that the 
price of oral azacitidine has a significant impact on ICERs (P < 0.05). 
Probability sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of 
cost-effectiveness for oral azacitidine is 0.
CONCLUSION: In the United States, oral azacitidine is unlikely to be 
cost-effective for AML patients at current prices.

INTRODUCTION: Evidence from clinical trials supports the efficacy of oral 
magnesium supplementation in the treatment of glucose-related disorders. Thus, 
we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using oral magnesium chloride (MgCl2) in 
prediabetes treatment.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. For such purpose, we used 
original information from a randomized controlled clinical trial. Analysis was 
carried out based on a health services provider perspective, a 10-year time 
horizon, and 3% discount rate for costs and effectiveness. Taking into account 
risk factor profiles, a Markov micro-simulation model was used, and a 
probabilistic sensibility analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The oral MgCl2 was dominant with lower cost and greater effectiveness 
as compared with placebo. As compared with placebo, 22.3% and 22.0% of men using 
MgCl2 did not develop diabetes or cardiovascular disease. The cost per person of 
using MgCl2 as compared with placebo, in the individuals without complications, 
was $2206 versus $4048 USD for men, and $1984 versus $3272 USD for women. The 
sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the base case.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that using oral MgCl2 for at least 4 months, in 
adults with prediabetes and hypomagnesemia, is a cost-effective option for 
reducing complications and direct medical costs.

Neurogenic Heterotopic Ossification of the Hip after Brain Injury. Function 
Recovery Preserving Hip Joint: A Case Report.

INTRODUCTION: Up to 30% of patients with spinal cord injury and to 20% of 
patients with traumatic brain injury develop neurogenic heterotopic ossification 
(NHO). Patients develop restriction in joint range of motion (ROM) and 
impairment in activities of daily life. When neurological recovery occurs, 
joints dysfunction represents the cause for patients' autonomy loss.
CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 39-year-old Caucasian male involved in a 
car accident and experienced 14 days of post-traumatic coma. After 
rehabilitation, no residual motor or sensory neurological deficit was present, 
but bilateral NHOs surrounding hip joints developed. Seventeen months after 
trauma, the patient was admitted to our institute. He was confined to bed, 
absolutely unable to walk, stand or sit. Radiological evaluation consisted in 
Antero-Posterior X-ray view only, due to the inability to open up his hips for 
lateral views, and 3D computed tomography scan. "Functional resection" of the 
ossifications was performed and rehabilitation started from day 1 after surgery. 
At the final follow-up 24 months from the second operation high grade of 
clinical satisfaction was reported. The patients were able to walk 
independently, to put on his socks, and to drive a car and bike. Painless right 
and left hip ROM was, respectively, 100° and 90° for flexion, 10° for extension, 
35° and 30° for abduction, and near normal internal and external rotation. The 
patient referred that further improvement in mobility and fluency was still 
present day by day.
CONCLUSION: The rarity of the condition frequently bring to a delay in treatment 
and the absence of specific guidelines made treatment still dependent on surgeon 
experiences. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for success. Surgeons 
should be aware that it is important to refer patients to specialized center, 
because early resection could provide excellent results, preserving hip, and 
restoring function and patient independency.

PURPOSE: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating neuro-oncologic disease with 
invariably poor prognosis. Despite this, research shows patients have 
unrealistic perceptions of their prognosis, which may relate in part to 
communication patterns between patients, caregivers and oncologists. The purpose 
of this study was to examine communication processes and goals among patients, 
caregivers, and oncologists to elucidate drivers of prognostic understanding 
(PU) in the context of recurrent GBM.
METHODS: This was a prospective, multi-center study enrolling adult patients 
with GBM, caregivers, and oncologists, who independently reported the content of 
a specific discussion involving the disclosure of GBM recurrence. Communication 
processes and goals were characterized for each participant, and concordance 
between all dyads and patient-caregiver-oncologist triads were calculated.
RESULTS: Seventeen patient, caregiver, and oncologist triads were analyzed. At 
the individual level, three (17.6%) patients and 8 (47.1%) caregivers reported 
having discussed prognosis during the clinical encounter, as compared to ten 
oncologists (58.8%). Seven patients (41.2%) and 5 caregivers (29.4%), versus 
thirteen oncologists (76.5%) reported ever discussing prognosis or life 
expectancy at previous appointments. Generally, patient-caregiver concordance 
(i.e., both answered the same) regarding communication goals and processes was 
low. Triads showed limited concordant responses in discussing curability 
(n = 5), prognosis (n = 4), end-of-life treatment goals (n = 4), and ever 
discussing prognosis (n = 3).
CONCLUSION: Patients, caregivers and oncologists had discordant views regarding 
communication processes and prognostic goals, even when recalling a single 
discussion. This study highlights the importance of clear and frequent 
communication about prognosis, and the need for further research on 
communication and PU in the neuro-oncology setting.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) technology is increasingly used in disease 
management. Using mHealth tools to integrate and streamline care has improved 
clinical outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential clinical and 
health economic outcomes of mHealth-based integrated care for AF from the 
perspective of a public health care provider in China.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare outcomes of mHealth-based care 
and usual care in a hypothetical cohort of patients with AF in China. The time 
horizon was 30 years with monthly cycles. Model outcomes measured were direct 
medical cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine 
the robustness of the base-case results.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, mHealth-based care gained higher QALYs of 
0.0730 with an incurred cost of US $1090. Using US $33,438 per QALY (three times 
the gross domestic product) as the willingness-to-pay threshold, mHealth-based 
care was cost-effective, with an ICER of US $14,936 per QALY. In one-way 
sensitivity analysis, no influential factor with a threshold value was 
identified. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, mHealth-based care was 
accepted as cost-effective in 92.33% of 10,000 iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the expected cost-effectiveness of applying 
mHealth-based integrated care for AF according to a model-based health economic 
evaluation. The exploration suggested the potential cost-effective use of 
mHealth apps in streamlining and integrating care via the Atrial fibrillation 
Better Care (ABC) pathway for AF in China. Future economic evaluation alongside 
randomized clinical trials is highly warranted to verify the suggestion and 
investigate affecting factors such as geographical variations in patient 
characteristics, identification of subgroups, and constraints on local 
implementation.

BACKGROUND: Although kidney transplantation (KT) is considered the best 
treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there are concerns about its 
benefit in the obese population because of the increased incidence of 
post-transplant adverse events. We compared patients who underwent KT versus 
patients awaiting KT on dialysis.
METHODS: We estimated the life expectancy [restricted mean survival time (RMST)] 
for a 10-year follow-up by matching on time-dependent propensity scores. The 
primary outcome was time to death.
RESULTS: In patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 (n = 2155 patients 
per arm), the RMST was 8.23 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.05-8.40] in 
the KT group versus 8.00 years (95% CI 7.82-8.18) in the awaiting KT group, a 
difference of 2.71 months (95% CI -0.19-5.63). In patients with a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 
(n = 212 patients per arm), we reported no significant difference [8.56 years 
(95% CI 7.96-9.08) versus 8.66 (95% CI 8.10-9.17)]. Hence we deduced that KT in 
patients with a BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m2 was beneficial in terms of life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Regarding the organ shortage, KT may be questionable for those with 
a BMI ≥35 kg/m2. These results do not mean that a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 should be a 
barrier to KT, but it should be accounted for in allocation systems to better 
assign grafts and maximize the overall life expectancy of ESRD patients.

Modeling Years of Life Lost Due to COVID-19, Socioeconomic Status, and 
Nonpharmaceutical Interventions: Development of a Prediction Model.

BACKGROUND: Research in the COVID-19 pandemic focused on the health burden, 
thereby largely neglecting the potential harm to life from welfare losses.
OBJECTIVE: This paper develops a model that compares the years of life lost 
(YLL) due to COVID-19 and the potential YLL due to the socioeconomic 
consequences of its containment.
METHODS: It improves on existing estimates by conceptually disentangling YLL due 
to COVID-19 and socioeconomic status. By reconciling the normative life table 
approach with socioeconomic differences in life expectancy, it accounts for the 
fact that people with low socioeconomic status are hit particularly hard by the 
pandemic. The model also draws on estimates of socioeconomic differences in life 
expectancy to ascertain potential YLL due to income loss, school closures, and 
extreme poverty.
RESULTS: Tentative results suggest that if only one-tenth of the current 
socioeconomic damage becomes permanent in the future, it may carry a higher YLL 
burden than COVID-19 in the more likely pandemic scenarios. The model further 
suggests that the socioeconomic harm outweighs the disease burden due to 
COVID-19 more quickly in poorer and more unequal societies. Most urgently, the 
substantial increase in extreme poverty needs immediate attention. Avoiding a 
relatively minor number of 4 million unemployed, 1 million extremely poor, and 2 
million students with a higher learning loss may save a similar amount of life 
years as saving 1 million people from dying from COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Primarily, the results illustrate the urgent need for 
redistributive policy interventions and global solidarity. In addition, the 
potentially high YLL burden from income and learning losses raises the burden of 
proof for the efficacy and necessity of school and business closures in the 
containment of the pandemic, especially where social safety nets are 
underdeveloped.

BACKGROUND: Digital health technologies have been used to enhance adherence to 
TB medication, but the cost-effectiveness remains unclear.
METHODS: We used the real data from the study conducted from April 2014 to 
December 2020 in Morocco using a smart pillbox with a web-based medication 
monitoring system, called Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS). 
Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a decision analysis model including 
Markov model for Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB from the health system 
perspective. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) per disability adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Two-way sensitive 
analysis was done for the treatment success rate between MEMS and standard of 
care.
RESULTS: The average total per-patient health system costs for treating a new TB 
patient under MEMS versus standard of care were $398.70 and $155.70, 
respectively. The MEMS strategy would reduce the number of drug-susceptible TB 
cases by 0.17 and MDR-TB cases by 0.01 per patient over five years. The ICER of 
MEMS was $434/DALY averted relative to standard of care, and was most 
susceptible to the TB treatment success rate of both strategies followed by the 
managing cost of MEMS.
CONCLUSION: MEMS is considered cost-effective for managing infectious active TB 
in Morocco.

Lately, in case of a number of life-threatening and chronic progressive rare 
(orphan) diseases, resulting in decreasing of life expectancy of citizens or 
their disability, the powers to support patients with medications were 
transferred from regional to federal level. Among these diseases are hemolytic 
uremic syndrome, mucopolysaccharidose type I, II, VI, juvenile arthritis with 
systemic onset, unspecified aplastic anemia, hereditary deficiency of factors II 
(fibrinogen), VII (labile), X (Stuart-Prauer). The article considers data 
concerning hemolytic uremic syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, II, VI, 
juvenile arthritis with systemic onset - the diseases for which medication 
support provision was transferred to Federal level in the first place and for 
which at the time of preparation of the article there were sufficient data to 
analyze.

The diseases of peripheral nervous system (PNS diseases) are diagnosed in 
48%-72% of workers in various branches of economy. They made up more than half 
of all occupational diseases and are the main cause of labor ability and of high 
level of disability able-bodied population. The purpose of the study is to 
assess social economic importance of disability because of PNS diseases of 
able-bodied population in the Republic of Bashkortostan. It is established that 
in 2014-2018 about 107 individuals of able-bodied age for the first time became 
disabled because of PNS diseases. The average annual level of individuals of 
able-bodied age with for the first time established disabilities because of PNS 
diseases made up to 0.1 cases per 10 thousand of population. Among the disabled 
69.0 ± 5.4% are males. The disability rate in males (0.142o/ooo) is twice higher 
than in females (0.063o/ooo). The average age of the disabled is 48.7 ± 5.7 
years. In the structure of disability dominate lumbosacral radiculopathy 
(50.9%), polyneuropathy of upper (15.3%) and lower (13.5%) extremities. In 
average, the disability develops in 11.3 years prior to age of 60 years and on 
3.8-5.5 years earlier than in case of other diseases. The disability because of 
PNS diseases shortens healthy life expectancy by 16.0% in males and by 17.8% in 
females. Annual economic losses come to more than 26 million rubles of 
non-produced production. The disability because of PNS consists significant 
social economic problem of society and requires increased attention to 
prevention, early diagnostics, treatment, improvement of quality of medical 
social expertise, rehabilitation and habilitation.
