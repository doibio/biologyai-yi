BACKGROUND: Several studies have revealed widening of inequalities in life 
expectancy, but little is known about the recent changes in health expectancy 
nationally and between socioeconomic groups. This study examines dynamics of 
national and education-specific life expectancy and health expectancies at age 
50 years in Denmark from 2004/2007 to 2015.
METHODS: Nationwide register data on education and mortality were linked and 
combined with Danish health data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and 
Retirement in Europe and changes in life expectancy and three health expectancy 
indicators were estimated by Sullivan's method.
RESULTS: From 2004 to 2015, national life expectancy at age 50 years increased 
by 2.4 years for men and 2.1 years for women. Simultaneously, after an initial 
rapid improvement from 2004 to 2007, the pace of progress in health expectancy 
decreased. From 2007 to 2015, the difference in life expectancy at age 50 years 
between men with long and short education increased from 4.3 to 5.0 years. For 
women, the corresponding increase in the life expectancy gap was less pronounced 
from 3.5 to 3.8 years. The educational gap in lifetime without long-term illness 
decreased from 4.6 years to 3.1 years for men and from 6.1 years to 4.6 years 
for women. On the contrary, the educational gap increased for lifetime without 
activity limitations and in self-rated good health.
CONCLUSIONS: Previously observed improvements in health expectancy in Denmark 
slowed down despite continuing progress in life expectancy. This worrying change 
coincides with persistent educational inequalities in life expectancy and health 
expectancy and is a challenge to a sustainable social and health development in 
the future.

AIMS: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated by chronic hemodialysis (HD) is 
associated with poor cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, with no available 
evidence-based therapeutics. A multiplexed proteomic approach may identify new 
pathophysiological pathways associated with CV outcomes, potentially actionable 
for precision medicine.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The AURORA trial was an international, multicentre, 
randomized, double-blind trial involving 2776 patients undergoing maintenance 
HD. Rosuvastatin vs. placebo had no significant effect on the composite primary 
endpoint of death from CV causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal 
stroke. We first compared CV risk-matched cases and controls (n = 410) to 
identify novel biomarkers using a multiplex proximity extension immunoassay (276 
proteomic biomarkers assessed with OlinkTM). We replicated our findings in 200 
unmatched cases and 200 controls. External validation was conducted from a 
multicentre real-life Danish cohort [Aarhus-Aalborg (AA), n = 331 patients] in 
which 92 OlinkTM biomarkers were assessed. In AURORA, only N-terminal pro-brain 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, positive association) and stem cell factor (SCF) 
(negative association) were found consistently associated with the trial's 
primary outcome across exploration and replication phases, independently from 
the baseline characteristics. Stem cell factor displayed a lower added 
predictive ability compared with NT-ProBNP. In the AA cohort, in multivariable 
analyses, BNP was found significantly associated with major CV events, while 
higher SCF was associated with less frequent CV deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that NT-proBNP and SCF may help identify ESRD 
patients with respectively high and low CV risk, beyond classical clinical 
predictors and also point at novel pathways for prevention and treatment.

Trimers of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein perform receptor binding and 
virus-cell fusion functions during the virus life cycle. The cytoplasmic tail 
(CT) of Env forms an unusual baseplate structure, and is palmitoylated, rich in 
arginines, carries trafficking motifs, binds cholesterol, and interacts with 
host proteins. To dissect CT activities, we examined a panel of Env variants, 
including CT truncations, mutations, and an extension. We found that whereas all 
variants could replicate in permissive cells, viruses with CT truncations or 
baseplate mutations were defective in restrictive cells. We also identified a 
determinant in HIV-1 amphotericin sensitivity, and characterized variants that 
escape amphotericin inhibition via viral protease-mediated CT cleavage. Results 
additionally showed that full-length, his tagged Env can oligomerize and be 
co-assembled with CT truncations that delete portions of the baseplate, host 
protein binding sites, and trafficking signals. Our observations illuminate 
novel aspects of HIV-1 CT structure, interactions, and functions.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to estimate the global burden of atrial 
fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter (AFL) and its attributable risk factors from 
1990 to 2019.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The data on AF/AFL were retrieved from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study (GBD) 2019. Incidence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and 
deaths were metrics used to measure AF/AFL burden. The population attributable 
fractions (PAFs) were used to calculate the percentage contributions of major 
potential risk factors to age-standardized AF/AFL death. The analysis was 
performed between 1990 and 2019. Globally, in 2019, there were 4.7 million [95% 
uncertainty interval (UI): 3.6 to 6.0] incident cases, 8.4 million (95% UI: 6.7 
to 10.5) DALYs cases, and 0.32 million (95% UI: 0.27 to 0.36) deaths of AF/AFL. 
The burden of AF/AFL in 2019 and their temporal trends from 1990 to 2019 varied 
widely due to gender, Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) quintile, and geographical 
location. Among all potential risk factors, age-standardized AF/AFL death 
worldwide in 2019 were primarily attributable to high systolic blood pressure 
[34.0% (95% UI: 27.3 to 41.0)], followed by high body mass index [20.2% (95% UI: 
11.2 to 31.2)], alcohol use [7.4% (95% UI: 5.8 to 9.0)], smoking [4.3% (95% UI: 
2.9 to 5.9)], diet high in sodium [4.2% (95% UI: 0.8 to 10.5)], and lead 
exposure [2.3% (95% UI: 1.3 to 3.4)].
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that AF/AFL is still a major public health concern. 
Despite the advancements in the prevention and treatment of AF/AFL, especially 
in regions in the relatively SDI quintile, the burden of AF/AFL in regions in 
lower SDI quintile is increasing. Since AF/AFL is largely preventable and 
treatable, there is an urgent need to implement more cost-effective strategies 
and interventions to address modifiable risk factors, especially in regions with 
high or increased AF/AFL burden.

INTRODUCTION: Infant HIV prophylaxis with broadly neutralizing anti-HIV 
antibodies (bNAbs) could provide long-acting protection against vertical 
transmission. We sought to estimate the potential clinical impact and 
cost-effectiveness of hypothetical bNAb prophylaxis programmes for children 
known to be HIV exposed at birth in three sub-Saharan African settings.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using the CEPAC-Pediatric 
model, simulating cohorts of infants from birth through death in Côte d'Ivoire, 
South Africa and Zimbabwe. These settings were selected to reflect a broad range 
of HIV care cascade characteristics, antenatal HIV prevalence and budgetary 
constraints. We modelled strategies targeting bNAbs to only WHO-designated 
"high-risk" HIV-exposed infants (HR-HIVE) or to all HIV-exposed infants (HIVE). 
We compared four prophylaxis approaches within each target population: standard 
of care oral antiretroviral prophylaxis (SOC), and SOC plus bNAbs at birth 
(1-dose), at birth and 3 months (2-doses), or every 3 months throughout 
breastfeeding (Extended). Base-case model inputs included bNAb efficacy 
(60%/dose), effect duration (3 months/dose) and costs ($60/dose), based on 
published literature. Outcomes included paediatric HIV incidence and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) calculated from discounted life expectancy and 
lifetime HIV-related costs.
RESULTS: The model projects that bNAbs would reduce absolute infant HIV 
incidence by 0.3-2.2% (9.6-34.9% relative reduction), varying by country, 
prophylaxis approach and target population. In all three settings, 
HR-HIVE-1-dose would be cost-saving compared to SOC. Using a 50% GDP per capita 
ICER threshold, HIVE-Extended would be cost-effective in all three settings with 
ICERs of $497/YLS in Côte d'Ivoire, $464/YLS in South Africa and $455/YLS in 
Zimbabwe. In all three settings, bNAb strategies would remain cost-effective at 
costs up to $200/dose if efficacy is ≥30%. If the bNAb effect duration were 
reduced to 1 month, the cost-effective strategy would become HR-HIVE-1-dose in 
Côte d'Ivoire and Zimbabwe and HR-HIVE-2-doses in South Africa. Findings 
regarding the cost-effectiveness of bNAb implementation strategies remained 
robust in sensitivity analyses regarding breastfeeding duration, maternal 
engagement in postpartum care, early infant diagnosis uptake and antiretroviral 
treatment costs.
CONCLUSIONS: At current efficacy and cost estimates, bNAb prophylaxis for 
HIV-exposed children in sub-Saharan African settings would be a cost-effective 
intervention to reduce vertical HIV transmission.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between demoralization and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) in a sample of end-of-life cancer patients with a life 
expectancy of 4 months or less undergoing palliative care, controlling for 
sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological variables.
METHODS: Sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological data from 170 end-of-life 
cancer patients were collected using the following scales: Edmonton Symptom 
Assessment System for palliative care patients' symptoms; Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms; Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy Scale - General Measure (FACT-G) for HRQoL; Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being for spirituality (FACIT-Sp); 
Demoralization Scale - Italian Version (DS-IT) for demoralization.
RESULTS: The DS-IT showed that 51.8% of cancer patients were severely 
demoralized. In addition, 36.5% of the sample had clinically significant 
depressive symptoms and QoL was severely impaired (FACT-G). The result of 
regression analysis showed that demoralization (especially "Disheartenment" and 
"Sense of failure") was the strongest contributor for HRQoL, followed by 
ESAS_Lack of Well-Being and depression (PHQ-9), with the final model explaining 
66% of the variance of the FACT-G.
CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight a very high prevalence of severe 
demoralization in end-of life cancer patients. Moreover, demoralization was not 
only associated with patients' HRQoL, but it was also the most important 
contributing factor. This finding underscores the need to identify preventive or 
therapeutic psychological interventions that focus on preventing existential 
distress, and thus improve the QoL of dying patients in their last days of life.

BACKGROUND: We have done a systematic literature review about CRC Screening over 
75 years old in order to update knowledge and make recommendations.
METHODS: PUBMED database was searched in October 2021 for articles published on 
CRC screening in the elderly, and generated 249 articles. Further searches were 
made to find articles on the acceptability, efficacy, and harms of screening in 
this population, together with the state of international guidelines.
RESULTS: Most benefit-risk data on CRC screening in the over 75 s derived from 
simulation studies. Most guidelines recommend stopping cancer screening at the 
age of 75. In private health systems, extension of screening up to 80-85 years 
is, based on the life expectancy and the history of screening. Screening remains 
effective in populations without comorbidity given their better life-expectancy. 
Serious adverse events of colonoscopy increase with age and can outweigh the 
benefit of screening. The great majority of reviews concluded that screening 
between 75 and 85 years must be decided case by case.
CONCLUSION: The current literature does not allow Evidence-Based Medicine 
propositions for mass screening above 75 years old. As some subjects over 
75 years may benefit from CRC screening, we discussed ways to introduce CRC 
screening in France in the 75-80 age group. IRB: An institutional review board 
composed of members of the 2 learned societies (SOFOG and FFCD) defined the 
issues of interest, followed the evolution of the work and reviewed and 
validated the report.

BACKGROUND: There is consensus that the 2008 financial and economic crisis and 
related austerity measures adversely impacted access to healthcare. In light of 
the growing debt caused by the COVID-19 crisis, it is uncertain whether a period 
of austerity will return.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide a structured overview of the impact of 
austerity policies in the EU-28 zone, applied in response to the Great 
Recession, on access to health care for the adult population, using the five 
access dimensions by Levesque et al. (2013).
METHODS: This study followed the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews guideline. 
Medline (PubMed) and Web of Science were searched between February 2021 and June 
2021. Primary studies in the English language published after the 1st of January 
2008 reporting on the possible change in access to the healthcare system for the 
adult population induced by austerity in an EU28 country were included.
RESULTS: The final search strategy resulted in 525 articles, of which 75 studies 
were reviewed for full-text analysis, and a total of 21 studies were included. 
Results revealed that austerity policy has been primarily associated with a 
reduction in access to healthcare, described through four main categories: i) 
Increase in rates of reported unmet needs (86%); ii) Affordability (38%); iii) 
Appropriateness (38%); iv) and Availability and Accommodation (19%). Vulnerable 
populations were more affected by austerity measures than the general population 
when specific safeguards were not in place. The main affected adult vulnerable 
population groups were: patients with chronic diseases, elderly people, 
(undocumented) migrants, unemployed, economically inactive people and 
individuals with lower levels of education or socioeconomic status.
CONCLUSION: Austerity measures have led to a deterioration in access to 
healthcare in the vast majority of the countries studied in the EU-28 zone. 
Findings should prompt policymakers to rethink the fiscal agenda across all 
policies in times of economic crisis and focus on the needs of the most 
vulnerable populations from the health perspective.

BACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection can have a major impact on the 
life expectancy of Marfan syndrome (MFS) or Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) patients. 
Although obesity can influence the development of aortic complications, evidence 
on whether obesity influences the development of aortic aneurysm or dissection 
in MFS and LDS is limited. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the 
relationship between aortic size and body composition, assessed by modern 
bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in MFS/LDS-patients.
METHODS: In this exploratory cross-sectional study in MFS or LDS patients, 
enrolled between June 2020 and May 2022, 34 patients received modern BIA and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n=32) or computed tomography (CT) imaging 
(n=2) of the entire aorta. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (66% female; mean age: 37.7±11.7; range, 17-68 
years) with MFS or LDS were enrolled; 34 patients, 27 with MFS and 7 with LDS, 
underwent aortic MRI or CT scanning. The mean aortic length was 503.7±58.7 mm, 
and the mean thoracic aortic length and abdominal aortic length were 351.5±52.4 
and 152.2±27.4 mm, respectively. The aortic bulb and the ascending aorta were 
measured only in the non-surgically repaired patients. Fifteen MFS (88.2%) and 
two LDS (40.0%) patients had an aortic aneurysm. In these, the aortic bulb 
tended to be larger in MFS than in LDS patients [42.6×41.9×41.2 vs. 
37.8×37.4×36.8 mm; P=0.07 (-1.1; 9.1); P=0.07 (-1.2; 8.4); P=0.07 (-1.5; 7.9)]. 
BIA revealed mean body fat levels of 31.6%±8.7% (range, 9.5-53.5%), indicating 
that 18 patients (52.9%) were obese. There was a significant correlation between 
body fat content and thoracic aortic length (R=-0.377; P=0.02), muscle mass and 
total aortic length (R=0.359; P=0.03), thoracic aortic length (R=0.399; P=0.02), 
extracellular mass (ECM), and total aortic length (R=0.354; P=0.04), and 
connective tissue and aortic diameters at the aortic arch (R=0.511; P=0.002), 
aortic isthmus (R=0.565; P<0.001), and abdominal aorta (R=0.486; P=0.004). Older 
age was correlated with wider aortic arch, isthmus, and abdominal aorta. Male 
patients had a longer aorta.
CONCLUSIONS: While a slender habitus is commonly known for MFS and LDS patients, 
our data show that many MFS and LDS patients (especially female) do not fit this 
phenotypic characteristic and are obese, which is associated with a more severe 
aortic phenotype. This topic should be included in the clinical assessment of 
affected MFS and LDS patients, in addition to measurement of the aortic 
diameters. Physicians should systematically screen MFS and LDS patients for 
obesity, educate them about the potential risk of resulting aortic 
complications, and encourage them to adopt a healthy lifestyle, that includes 
(mild) exercise and a balanced diet.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether self-reported EQ-5D full health state (FHS) 
after therapeutic intervention for active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is 
associated with a reduced risk to accrue organ damage. In a separate analysis, 
we sought to investigate associations between experience of "no problems" in 
each one of the five dimensions of EQ-5D and the risk to accrue damage.
METHODS: Data from the open-label extension periods of the BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 
trials of belimumab in SLE (NCT00724867; NCT00712933) were used (N = 973). FHS 
was defined as an experience of "no problems" in all five EQ-5D dimensions. 
Organ damage was assessed annually using the Systemic Lupus International 
Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage 
Index (SDI). Associations between the three-level version of the EQ-5D 
(EQ-5D-3L) responses at open-label baseline and the first documented increase in 
organ damage were investigated using Cox regression accounting for age, sex, 
ancestry, SDI at baseline, and background therapy, and associations with SDI 
items were investigated using phi (φ) correlation analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 147 patients (15.1%) accrued organ damage during follow-up, 
with the first increase in their SDI score occurring after a mean time of 29.1 ± 
19.6 months. Lower proportions of FHS respondents accrued damage over a course 
of up to 7.9 years of open-label follow-up compared with no FHS respondents (p = 
0.004; derived from the logrank test). FHS was associated with a reduced hazard 
to accrue subsequent organ damage (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.38-0.96; p = 0.033) after 
adjustments, as was experience of "no problems" in mobility (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 
0.43-0.87; p = 0.006). "No problems" in mobility was negatively correlated with 
musculoskeletal damage accrual (φ = -0.08; p = 0.008) and associated with a 
lower hazard to accrue musculoskeletal damage in Cox regression analysis (HR: 
0.38; 95% CI: 0.19-0.76; p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Experience of EQ-5D-3L FHS and "no problems" in mobility after 
therapeutic intervention heralded reduced hazard to accrue subsequent organ 
damage, especially musculoskeletal damage, suggesting that optimisation of these 
health-related quality of life aspects constitutes a clinically relevant 
treatment target in patients with SLE, along with clinical and laboratory 
parameters.

INTRODUCTION: For most older adults with dementia, the short-term harms and 
burdens of routine cancer screening likely outweigh the delayed benefits. We 
aimed to provide a more updated assessment of the extent that US older adults 
with dementia receive breast and prostate cancer screenings.
METHODS: Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Wave 12 (2014-2015) linked 
to Medicare, we examine rates of breast and prostate cancer screenings in adults 
65+ years by cognitive status. We used claims data to identify eligibility for 
screening and receipt of screening. We used a validated method using HRS data to 
define cognitive status.
RESULTS: The analytic sample included 2439 women in the breast cancer screening 
cohort and 1846 men in the prostate cancer screening cohort. Average ages were 
76.8 years for women and 75.6 years for men, with 9.0% and 7.6% with dementia in 
each cohort, respectively. Among women with dementia, 12.3% were screened for 
breast cancer. When stratified by age, 10.6% of those 75+ and have dementia were 
screened for breast cancer. When stratified by predicted life expectancy, 10.4% 
of those with predicted life expectancy of <10 years and have dementia were 
screened for breast cancer. Among men with dementia, 33.9% were screened for 
prostate cancer. When stratified by age, 30.9% of those 75+ and have dementia 
were screened for prostate cancer. When stratified by predicted life expectancy, 
34.4% of those with predicted life expectancy of <10 years and have dementia 
were screened for prostate cancer. Using multivariable logistic regression, 
dementia was associated with lower odds of receiving breast cancer screening (OR 
0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.57) and prostate cancer screening (OR 0.58, 95% CI 
0.36-0.96).
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest potential over-screening in older adults with 
dementia. Better supporting dementia patients and caregivers to make informed 
cancer screening decisions is critical.

AIM: Perturbed calcium homeostasis limits life expectancy in familial 
hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC). This rare 
disease occurs by loss-of-function mutations in CLDN16 or CLDN19 genes, causing 
impaired paracellular reabsorption of divalent cations along the cortical thick 
ascending limb (cTAL). Only partial compensation takes place in the ensuing late 
distal convoluted tubule, connecting tubule, and collecting duct, where the 
luminal transient receptor potential channel V5 (TRPV5), as well as basolateral 
plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) and sodium-potassium exchanger (NCX1) 
mediate transcellular Ca2+ reabsorption. The loop diuretic furosemide induces 
compensatory activation in these distal segments. Normally, furosemide enhances 
urinary calcium excretion via inhibition of the aforementioned cTAL. As Ca2+ 
reabsorption in the cTAL is already severely impaired in FHHNC patients, 
furosemide may alleviate hypercalciuria in this disease by activation of the 
distal transcellular Ca2+ transport proteins.
METHODS: Cldn16-deficient mice (Cldn16-/- ) served as a FHHNC model. Wild-type 
(WT) and Cldn16-/- mice were treated with furosemide (7 days of 40 mg/kg bw) or 
vehicle. We assessed renal electrolyte handling (metabolic cages) and key 
divalent transport proteins.
RESULTS: Cldn16-/- mice show higher Ca2+ excretion than WT and compensatory 
stimulation of Cldn2, TRPV5, and NCX1 at baseline. Furosemide reduced 
hypercalciuria in Cldn16-/- mice and enhanced TRPV5 and PMCA levels in Cldn16-/- 
but not in WT mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Furosemide significantly reduces hypercalciuria, likely via 
upregulation of luminal and basolateral Ca2+ transport systems in the distal 
nephron and collecting duct in this model for FHHNC.

Assessing the Acceptability of Home Blood Monitoring for Patients With Cancer 
Who Are Receiving Systemic Anticancer Therapy From a Patient, Caregiver, and 
Clinician Perspective: Focus Group and Interview Study.

BACKGROUND: Regular blood testing is an integral part of systemic anticancer 
therapy delivery. Blood tests are required before every administration of 
treatment to ensure that a patient is sufficiently well to receive it. Blood 
testing is burdensome for patients as they require either an extra visit within 
48 hours of planned administration of treatment or a significantly long visit if 
performed on the day of treatment. The additional time for appointments can have 
a significant impact on the quality of life of someone who is living with 
cancer. In the United Kingdom, the COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented 
disruption to the delivery of cancer care. Face-to-face hospital visits were 
reduced, resulting in the need to develop more innovative ways of working to 
minimize treatment interruptions. This led to significant uptake of digital 
technologies, with new models of care rapidly deployed across the UK health 
service to meet these challenges.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the acceptability of a point-of-care home 
blood monitoring device for people with cancer who are receiving systemic 
anticancer therapy, which is being developed in response to the increased need 
for remote care for patients with cancer.
METHODS: Qualitative focus groups and semistructured interviews were conducted 
with patients (23/47, 49%), caregivers (6/47, 13%), and health care 
professionals (18/47, 38%) over a 19-month time frame from May 2019 to December 
2020. Data were analyzed using framework analysis guided by the Unified Theory 
of Acceptance and Use of Technology model.
RESULTS: Analysis identified 4 overarching themes: performance expectancy, 
effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that patients with cancer, their caregivers, and 
health care professionals had positive perceptions about home blood monitoring. 
Although they are often considered synonymously, self-testing and 
self-management are not mutually exclusive, and this study illustrated some 
disparity in opinions regarding patient self-management. Home blood monitoring 
has the potential to provide patients with cancer with a convenient option for 
blood monitoring. It would minimize hospital attendances, decrease late 
treatment deferrals, and provide prompt recognition of cancer treatment 
toxicities, thus enhancing the existing nurse-led protocols and clinical 
pathways. Home blood monitoring would create a long-term sustainable 
transformation for the delivery of cancer care, using digital health to act as a 
facilitator to address a pertinent issue regarding improving the efficiency of 
hospital resources and increasing the delivery of personalized patient care. 
Further studies are needed to determine how and where home blood monitoring 
would fit within clinical pathways, in a way that is robust and equitable.

Cost-effectiveness of MicroRNA for Pancreatic Cancer Screening in Patients With 
Diabetes.

School of Medical Sciences, Kanagawa; and Advanced Research Promotion Center, 
Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, Ishikari, Japan.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of microRNA 
compared with carbohydrate antigen 19-9, abdominal ultrasound, magnetic 
resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography, positron emission 
tomography, and no screening for pancreatic cancer (PC) screening in patients 
with diabetes.
METHODS: We developed a state-transition model from a health care payer 
perspective and a lifetime horizon. We targeted 3 hypothetical cohorts of 
patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes (LSD), new-onset diabetes (NOD), and 
LSD having intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), aged 40, 50, 60, and 
70 years. The main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years, life 
expectancy life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and deaths from 
PC.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, abdominal ultrasound in patients with LSD 
and microRNA in patients with NOD and LSD having IPMN were the most 
cost-effective for all age groups. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to PC 
incidence and the cost of microRNA. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 
that microRNA was 42% to 54% cost-effective for NOD and 76% to 78% 
cost-effective for LSD having IPMN at a willingness-to-pay level of US $100,000 
per quality-adjusted life-year gained. MicroRNA prevented 30,641 PC deaths in 
diabetic patients compared with no screening.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NOD and LSD having IPMN, microRNA-based PC 
screening is cost-effective and recommended for early PC detection.

OBJECTIVES: Persons with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and drug use disorder (DUD) 
have a lower life expectancy than the general population. We examined the burden 
of somatic diseases among persons with AUD or DUD and investigated impact of 
socioeconomic status (SES) and mental health disorders on the co-occurrence of 
somatic diseases in these groups.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, register-based cohort study with a 6-year 
follow-up of persons (aged ≥18 y) with AUD (13,478) or DUD (16,659). Cox 
regression analyses were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of somatic 
diseases.
RESULTS: Patients with DUD were, on average, 10 years younger at the point of 
diagnosis than patients with AUD. Mental illnesses were prominent in both groups 
(AUD: 40.5%, and DUD: 46.9% vs 3.5% in controls). Adjusting for mental 
disorders, the risk of all somatic diseases among the AUD and DUD groups was 
reduced by 30%. Some of the elevated risk of somatic diseases among persons with 
AUD and DUD is explained by low SES, though less than that explained by the 
presence of mental disorders. The diseases with highest risk among AUD patients 
were metabolic disorders (16.9-fold) and hypertension (14.8-fold), and among AUD 
patients, viral hepatitis (23.3-fold), after adjusting for low SES and mental 
disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Persons with AUD had a higher risk of most somatic diseases, while 
those with DUD had specific risks for infections and viral hepatitis. Mental 
health disorders and SES adjusted the associations regarding most somatic 
diseases. In general, improvement of socio-economic conditions, preferably in 
combination with professional support to self-manage mental health problems, 
will reduce the risk of somatic illness in both groups. For DUD patients, 
available sterile user equipment will reduce the risk of viral hepatis.

OBJECTIVE: LESS-CHRON (List of Evidence-Based Deprescribing for Chronic 
Patients) and STOPPFrail (Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions in 
Frail adults with limited life expectancy) are criterion-based deprescribing 
tools. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of potentially inappropriate 
medications (PIMs) with these tools in an outpatient, polymedicated, older 
population with multimorbidity.
DESIGN: Single-center cross-sectional observational study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: PIMs and criteria subject to deprescribing identified 
by each tool were collected in patients who were being followed up on outpatient 
internal medicine consultation.
METHODS: PIMs were identified by STOPPFrail and LESS-CHRON criteria reviewing 
medical histories and pharmacologic treatments of the patients in the electronic 
health card system. Sociodemographic, clinical, and pharmacologic variables were 
recorded. A correlation analysis between treatment tools and clinical values was 
performed using the nonparametric Spearman rho correlation.
RESULTS: Eighty-three patients with a median of 14.4 (interquartile range 12-17) 
prescribed drugs were included. The total number of PIMs identified with 
LESS-CHRON was 158 vs 127 with STOPPFrail. Eight of the 27 criteria (29.6%) for 
LESS-CHRON and 15 of the 25 for STOPPFrail were found to be not applicable. A 
significant correlation was obtained for both tools with the number of 
prescribed drugs at the time of inclusion. The Profund, Barthel, and Frail-VIG 
index only showed a significant correlation with LESS-CHRON.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Both tools have shown the capacity to identify PIMs 
that can be deprescribed in the population studied. However, LESS-CHRON appears 
to have a greater detection potential in the subgroup of patients analyzed. 
STOPPFrail brings a certain complementarity in other areas of therapy not 
covered by LESS-CHRON.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and applicability of 
treating chronic respiratory insufficiency with diaphragm pacing relative to 
mechanical ventilation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review and analysis were conducted using the 
safety, appropriateness, financial neutrality, and efficacy principles.
RESULTS: Although mechanical ventilation is clearly indicated in acute 
respiratory failure, diaphragm pacing improves life expectancy, increases 
quality of life, and reduces complications in patients with chronic respiratory 
insufficiency.
CONCLUSION: Diaphragm pacing should be given more consideration in appropriately 
selected patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency.
