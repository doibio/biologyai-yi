BACKGROUND: STARDUST is a phase 3b randomized controlled trial comparing two 
ustekinumab treatment strategies in patients with Crohn's disease (CD): 
treat-to-target (T2T) versus standard of care (SoC).
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of a T2T or SoC ustekinumab treatment 
strategy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and work productivity and 
activity impairment (WPAI) over a 2-year follow-up period.
METHODS: At Week 16, adult patients with moderate-to-severe active CD were 
randomized 1:1 to either T2T or SoC treatment groups. We assessed changes from 
baseline in HRQoL measures (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ], 
EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level [visual analogue scale and index], Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale-Anxiety and -Depression) and the WPAI questionnaire in two patient 
populations: randomized analysis set (RAS, patients randomized to either T2T or 
SoC at Week 16 and completed Week 48) and modified RAS (mRAS, patients who 
entered the long-term extension [LTE] period at Week 48).
RESULTS: At Week 16, 440 patients were randomized to T2T (n = 219) or SoC 
(n = 221) arms; 366 patients completed Week 48. Of these, 323 patients entered 
the LTE and 258 patients completed 104 weeks of treatment. In the RAS 
population, percentages of patients achieving IBDQ response and remission were 
not significantly different between treatment arms at Weeks 16 and 48. In the 
overall mRAS population, IBDQ response and remission increased over time from 
Weeks 16-104. In both populations, improvements from baseline in all 
HRQoL measurements were observed at Week 16 and maintained until either Week 48 
or Week 104, respectively. In both populations, improvements from baseline in 
T2T and SoC arms at Weeks 16, 48 or 104 in WPAI domains were observed.
CONCLUSION: Independent of treatment strategy (T2T or SoC), ustekinumab was 
effective in improving HRQoL measurements and WPAI over a period of 2 years.

Genes, personality, and political behavior: A replication and extension using 
Danish twins.

In this article, we examine whether there is genetic overlap between personality 
traits and political participation, interest, and efficacy. We make several 
contributions to the literature. First, we use new data from a large sample of 
twins from Denmark to examine the link between genes, the Big Five traits, and 
political behavior. Previous research in this area has not examined the Danish 
context. Second, because our measures have some overlap with those used in 
previous studies, we are able to examine whether previous findings replicate in 
a different sample. Finally, we extend the literature by examining the possible 
genetic link between some personality and political traits that have not yet 
been explored. Overall, we find that genes account for a fairly large share of 
the correlation between two of the Big Five personality traits (openness and 
extraversion), political participation, and political interest. Thus, most of 
the relationship between these personality traits and our measures of political 
behavior can be accounted for by a common underlying genetic component.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a clinical syndrome related to peripheral artery 
disease (PAD) that is marked by ischemic rest pain or tissue loss such as 
nonhealing ulcers or gangrene. Without revascularization CLI carries a 30-50% 
risk of major limb amputation within 1 year. Initial surgical revascularization 
is recommended for patients with CLI who have a greater than 2-year life 
expectancy. We present the case of a 92-year-old male with severe peripheral 
artery disease with gangrene of bilateral toes who underwent right popliteal to 
distal peroneal bypass via the posterior approach using ipsilateral reversed 
GSV. The posterior approach provides excellent exposure and should be considered 
in distal surgical revascularization where the popliteal artery serves as inflow 
and distal peroneal artery as target outflow vessel.

Liposome-mediated delivery is a possible means to overcome several shortcomings 
with C. elegans as a model for identifying and testing drugs that retard aging. 
These include confounding interactions between drugs and the nematodes' 
bacterial food source and failure of drugs to be taken up into nematode tissues. 
To explore this, we have tested liposome-mediated delivery of a range of 
fluorescent dyes and drugs in C. elegans. Liposome encapsulation led to enhanced 
effects on lifespan, requiring smaller quantities of compounds, and enhanced 
uptake of several dyes into the gut lumen. However, one dye (Texas red) did not 
cross into nematode tissues, showing that liposomes cannot ensure the uptake of 
all compounds. Of six compounds previously reported to extend lifespan (vitamin 
C, N-acetylcysteine, glutathione (GSH), trimethadione, thioflavin T (ThT), and 
rapamycin), this effect was reproduced for the latter four in a 
condition-dependent manner. For GSH and ThT, antibiotics abrogated life 
extension, implying a bacterially mediated effect. With GSH, this was 
attributable to reduced early death from pharyngeal infection and associated 
with alterations of mitochondrial morphology in a manner suggesting a possible 
innate immune training effect. By contrast, ThT itself exhibited antibiotic 
effects. For rapamycin, significant increases in lifespan were only seen when 
bacterial proliferation was prevented. These results document the utility and 
limitations of liposome-mediated drug delivery for C. elegans. They also 
illustrate how nematode-bacteria interactions can determine the effects of 
compounds on C. elegans lifespan in a variety of ways.

The mainstay of appendiceal neuroendocrine neoplasm (aNEN) treatment is surgery, 
based on simple appendectomy or right-sided hemicolectomy with lymphadenectomy 
(RHC). The majority of aNENs are adequately treated with appendectomy, but 
current guidelines have poor accuracy in terms of selecting patients requiring 
RHC, especially in aNENs 1-2 cm in size. Simple appendectomy is curative for 
appendiceal NETs (G1-G2) < 1 cm (if the resection status is R0), whereas RHC 
with lymph node dissection is recommended in tumors ≥ 2 cm in diameter, based on 
the high risk of nodal metastases in these cases. The clinical management of 
aNENs 1-2 cm in size is more controversial because lymph node or distant 
metastases are uncommon but possible. In our opinion, patients with tumor 
size > 15 mm or with grading G2 (according to WHO 2010) and/or lympho-vascular 
invasion should be referred for radicalization with RHC. However, 
decision-making in these cases should include discussion within a 
multidisciplinary tumor board at referral centers with the aim of offering each 
patient a tailored treatment, also considering that relatively young patients 
with long-life expectancy represent the majority of cases.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is a severe, autosomal recessive disease that 
shortens life expectancy. According to studies, approximately 27% of patients 
with CF aged 2-5 years and 60 to 70% of adult patients are infected with P. 
aeruginosa. The patients experience bronchospasm leading to a persistent 
contracted state of the airways.
OBJECTIVES: The current work explores the possibility of combining ivacaftor and 
ciprofloxacin to combat the bacteria. A third drug L-salbutamol would be coated 
onto the surface of the drug-entrappped microparticles to instantaneously 
provide relief from bronchoconstriction.
METHODS: The microparticles were prepared using bovine serum albumin and 
L-leucine using the freeze-drying approach. The process and formulation 
parameters were optimized. The prepared microparticles were surface coated by 
L-salbutamol using the dry-blending method. The microparticles were subjected to 
rigorous in-vitro characterization for entrapment, inhalability, antimicrobial 
activity, cytotoxicity study and safety. The performance of the microparticles 
to be loaded into a inhaler was checked by the Anderson cascade impactor.
RESULTS: The freeze-dried microparticles had a particle size of 817.5 ± 5.6 nm 
with a polydispersity ratio of 0.33. They had a zeta potential of 
-23.3 ± 1.1 mV. The mass median aerodynamic diameter of the microparticles was 
3.75 ± 0.07 μm, and the geometric standard diameter was 1.66 ± 0.033 μm. The 
microparticles showed good loading efficiency for all three drugs. DSC, SEM, 
XRD, and FTIR studies confirmed the entrapment of ivacaftor and ciprofloxacin. 
SEM and TEM scans observed the shape and the smooth surface. Antimicrobial 
synergism was proven by the agar broth, and dilution technique and the 
formulation was deemed safe by the results of the MTT assay.
CONCLUSION: Freeze-dried microparticles of ivacaftor, ciprofloxacin, and 
L-salbutamol could pave way to a hitherto unexplored combination of drugs as a 
novel approach to treat P. aeruginosa infcetions and bronchoconstriction 
commonly associated with cystic fibrosis.

Low reliability when determining criterion a for posttraumatic stress disorder 
from self-report descriptions of traumatic events: The need for transparent 
methods.

OBJECTIVE: Exposure to a traumatic event is a primary criterion (Criterion A) 
for meeting Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Using self-report to establish 
diagnostic criteria in research has become more common, especially with 
internet-based research. However, some individuals may construe events as 
traumatic when they do not meet Criterion A. There has yet to be a test of 
interrater reliability (IRR) from self-report of traumatic events.
METHOD: Three graduate students in clinical psychology and three licensed 
psychologists rated Criterion A using the life events checklist (LEC), as well 
as the three modified LEC versions (specification of up to three index traumas; 
extension of part 2 of the LEC) aimed to increase IRR. One hundred participants 
completed each of the four versions of the LEC (N = 400). Bootstrapped 
permutation tests were used to estimate differences in IRR and to generate 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Overall, findings indicated fair-moderate IRR (Fleiss's kappa) κ = 
0.428, 95% CI [0.379, 0.477]. The other versions of the LEC (including 
additional clarifying questions in part 2 of the LEC and/or opportunities to 
describe up to three traumas) did not meaningfully increase IRR.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that relying on self-report from the LEC alone 
and/or single-rater assessment of open-text trauma descriptions is not 
recommended for determining whether a traumatic event meets Criterion A. We 
conclude that it is critical when collecting self-reported PTSD symptoms to 
provide a clear description of how Criterion A was assessed, initial agreement 
between raters, and how disagreements were resolved. (PsycInfo Database Record

β-1,3-Glucanases are considered key regulators responsible for the degradation 
of callose in plants, yet little is known about the role and mode of action of 
their encoding genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). In the present study, we 
identified the β-1,3-glucanase encoding gene β-1,3-GLUCANASE10 (SlBG10) and 
revealed its regulation in tomato pollen and fruit development, seed production, 
and disease resistance by modulating callose deposition. Compared with wild-type 
(WT) or SlBG10 overexpressing (SlBG10-OE) lines, knockout of SlBG10 caused 
pollen arrest and failure to set fruit with reduced male rather than female 
fecundity. Further analyses showed that SlBG10-knockout promoted callose 
deposition in anther at the tetrad-to-microspore stages, resulting in pollen 
abortion and male sterility. Moreover, loss-of-function SlBG10 delayed 
degradation of endosperm cell wall calloses during cellularization and impeded 
early seed development. We also uncovered that Botrytis cinerea infection 
induces SlBG10 expression in WT tomato, and the knockout lines showed increased 
callose accumulation in fruit pericarps, reduced susceptibility to B. cinerea, 
and enhanced antioxidant capacity to maintain tomato fruit quality. However, the 
expression of genes encoding cell wall hydrolases decreased in SlBG10-knockout 
tomatoes and thus led to an increase in pericarp epidermal thickness, 
enhancement in fruit firmness, reduction of fruit water loss, and extension of 
tomato shelf life. These findings not only expand our understanding of the 
involvement of β-1,3-glucanases as callose regulators in multiple developmental 
processes and pathogen resistance but also provide additional insight into the 
manipulation of multiagronomic traits for targeted tomato breeding.

Surgical Management of Metastatic Pathologic Subtrochanteric Fractures: 
Treatment Modalities and Associated Outcomes.

System South Florida, Plantation, Florida.

BACKGROUND: Subtrochanteric pathological fractures (PFs) occur in approximately 
one-third of femur bone metastases. We seek to analyze surgical treatment 
strategies for subtrochanteric metastatic PFs and their revision rates.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed using the PubMed and Ovid databases. 
Reoperations as a result of complications were analyzed according to initial 
treatment modality, primary tumor site, and type of revision procedure.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 544 patients, 405 with PFs and 139 with 
impending fractures. The study population's mean age was 65.85 years with a 
male/female ratio of 0.9. Patients with subtrochanteric PFs who underwent an 
intramedullary nail (IMN) procedure (75%) presented a noninfectious revision 
rate of 7.2%. Patients treated with prosthesis reconstruction (21%) presented a 
noninfectious revision rate of 8.9% for standard endoprostheses and 2.5% for 
tumoral endoprostheses (p < 0.001). Revision rates because of infection were 
2.2% for standard and 7.5% for tumoral endoprostheses. There were no infections 
within the IMN and plate/screws group (p = 0.407). Breast was the most common 
primary tumor site (41%) and had the highest revision rate (14.81%). Prosthetic 
reconstructions were the most common type of revision procedure.
CONCLUSION: No consensus exists regarding the optimal surgical approach in 
patients with subtrochanteric PFs. IMN is a simpler, less invasive procedure, 
ideal for patients with a shorter survival. Tumoral prostheses may be better 
suited for patients with longer life expectancies. Treatment should be tailored 
considering revision rates, patient's life expectancy, and surgeon's expertise.

The concept of the personalized rehabilitation is based on the principle of 
applying physical and rehabilitative medicine techniques depending on the 
factors that mostly influence on rehabilitation efficacy in a particular patient 
- determinant of effectiveness. Current achievements in the diagnosis and 
treatment of breast cancer (BC) significantly increased overall patients' life 
expectancy, updating rehabilitative treatment stage, which is often unmet.
OBJECTIVE: To perform the comprehensive analysis of the efficacy of personalized 
rehabilitation programs in patients with BC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The combined comparative multi-centre randomised trial of 
rehabilitation program efficacy in patients with breast cancer was done. The 
study included 219 patients aged from 30 to 45 years (median 39.4 year), who 
were divided into 2 groups. The rehabilitation by programs, that included 
current personalized rehabilitative techniques (RT) with proved efficiency, 
based on scientometrical analysis of evidential research was performed in the 
first group patients. In the second group aftercare was done according to the 
standard programs. The comprehensive evaluation of treatment efficacy was 
conducted in several stages: 1) performance analysis of rehabilitative programs; 
2) verification of the effectiveness' determinant of rehabilitation; 3) factor 
analysis to assess the mechanisms of therapeutic effects in experimental groups; 
4) comparative analysis of alternative strategies for selecting rehabilitation 
programs.
RESULTS: The use of rehabilitative programs, based on recommended RT, changes 
the rehabilitation structure, significantly increasing its efficacy by 17%. 
Furthermore, the percentage of high-efficiency usage of this type programs 
increases by 17% compared with standard programs. The main determinants, 
affecting the efficacy of rehabilitation programs, based on selected RT, are 
anamnestic data, parameters of exercise tolerance and physical activity and 
ultrasound parameters of upper limb blood flow. The therapeutic effects of 
personalized rehabilitation programs are realized by correction of clinical 
rates, increasing exercise tolerance and physical activity, as well as 
psychophysiological parameters.
CONCLUSION: The use of the evaluation system of anamnestic, clinical, functional 
and psychophysiological features of patient (the effectiveness' determinant) in 
realization of personalized rehabilitation programs for women with BC, allows to 
predict and manage the efficacy of RT applying.

Publisher: В основе концепции персонализированной реабилитации заложен принцип 
применения технологий физической и реабилитационной медицины на основании учета 
факторов, в наибольшей степени влияющих на эффективность реабилитации у 
конкретного пациента — детерминант эффективности. Современные достижения в 
диагностике и лечении больных раком молочной железы (РМЖ) значительно увеличили 
общую продолжительность жизни пациенток, актуализируя реабилитационный этап 
лечения, потребности в котором часто бывают не удовлетворены.
ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Комплексный анализ эффективности персонализированных программ 
реабилитации больных РМЖ.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОД: Проведено комбинированное сравнительное мультицентровое 
рандомизированное исследование эффективности реабилитационных программ у больных 
РМЖ. В исследование включены 219 пациенток в возрасте от 30 до 45 лет (медиана 
39,4 года), которые были рандомизированы в две группы. В 1-й группе пациенткам 
проводили реабилитационные мероприятия по программам, включающим современные 
персонализированные реабилитационные технологии (РТ) с доказанной 
эффективностью, разработанные на основе наукометрического анализа доказательных 
исследований; во 2-й группе — по стандартным программам. Комплексную оценку 
эффективности лечения проводили в несколько этапов: 1) анализ показателей 
эффективности реабилитационных программ; 2) верификация детерминант 
эффективности реабилитации; 3) факторный анализ с целью оценки механизмов 
реализации лечебных эффектов у пациентов исследуемых групп; 4) сравнительный 
анализ альтернативных стратегий выбора программ реабилитации.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Применение реабилитационных программ, разработанных на основе 
рекомендованных РТ, меняет структуру реабилитации, достоверно повышая ее 
эффективность на 17%. Также на 17% увеличивается доля высокоэффективного 
применения такого типа программ по сравнению со стандартными программами 
реабилитации. Основными детерминантами, влияющими на эффективность 
реабилитационных программ, составленных с учетом выбранных РТ, являются 
анамнестические параметры, параметры толерантности к физической нагрузке и 
физической активности и ультразвуковые параметры кровотока верхних конечностей. 
Лечебные эффекты при применении персонализированных программ реабилитации 
реализуются через коррекцию клинических показателей, повышение толерантности к 
физическим нагрузкам и физической активности, а также психофизиологических 
параметров.
ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: Использование системы оценки анамнестических, клинических, 
функциональных, психофизиологических особенностей пациента — детерминант 
эффективности в реализации персонализированных программ реабилитации больных 
РМЖ, позволяет прогнозировать и управлять эффективностью применения РТ.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains one of the most challenging health-related 
issues for our society. It is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially in 
developed countries, due to the rising life expectancy and, moreover, represents 
a considerable economic burden worldwide. All efforts at the discovery of new 
diagnostic and therapeutic tools in the last decades have invariably met with 
failure, making AD an incurable illness and underscoring the need for new 
approaches. In recent years, theranostic agents have emerged as an interesting 
strategy. They are molecules able to simultaneously provide diagnostic 
information and deliver therapeutic activity, allowing for the assessment of the 
molecule activity, the organism response and the pharmacokinetics. This makes 
these compounds promising for streamlining research on AD drugs and for their 
application in personalized medicine. We review here the field of small-molecule 
theranostic agents as promising tools for the development of novel diagnostic 
and therapeutic resources against AD, highlighting the positive and significant 
impact that theranostics can be expected to have in the near future in clinical 
practice.

The largest subunit of RNAPII extends as the conserved unstructured heptapeptide 
consensus repeats Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 and their posttranslational modification, 
especially the phosphorylation state at Ser2, Ser5 and Ser7 of CTD recruits 
different transcription factors involved in transcription. In the current study, 
fluorescence anisotropy, pull down assay and molecular dynamics simulation 
studies employed to conclude that peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase Rrd1 has 
strong affinity for unphosphorylated CTD rather than phosphorylated CTD for mRNA 
transcription. Rrd1 preferentially interacts with unphosphorylated GST-CTD in 
comparison to hyperphosphorylated GST-CTD in vitro. Fluorescence anisotropy 
revealed that recombinant Rrd1 prefers to bind unphosphorylated CTD peptide in 
comparison to phosphorylated CTD peptide. In computational studies, the RMSD of 
Rrd1-unphosphorylated CTD complex was greater than the RMSD of Rrd1-pCTD 
complex. During 50 ns MD simulation run Rrd1-pCTD complex get dissociated twice 
viz. 20 ns to 30 ns and 40 ns to 50 ns, while Rrd1-unpCTD complex remain stable 
throughout the process. Additionally, the Rrd1-unphosphorylated CTD complexes 
acquire comparatively higher number of H-bonds, water bridges and hydrophobic 
interactions occupancy than Rrd1-pCTD complex, concludes that the Rrd1 interacts 
more strongly with the unphosphorylated CTD than the pCTD.

There is little known about the global burden of CVD attributable to ambient 
PM2.5 (referred to as CVD burden hereinafter) and its secular trend across 
different regions and countries. We aimed to evaluate the spatiotemporal trends 
in CVD burden at the global, regional and national levels from 1990 to 2019. 
Data on CVD burden including mortality and disability adjusted of life years 
(DALYs) from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2019. Cases, the age-standardized rate of mortality (ASMR) and DALYs (ASDR) were 
estimated by age, sex and sociodemographic index (SDI). Estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to evaluate the temporal changing in 
ASDR and ASMR from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, 2.48 million deaths and 60.91 million 
DALYs of CVD were attributed to ambient PM2.5 globally. Most CVD burden occurred 
in males, elderly and the middle SDI region. At national level, Uzbekistan, 
Egypt, and Iraq had the highest ASMR and ASDR. Despite remarkable increase in 
number of DALYs and deaths of CVD worldwide from 1990 to 2019, we observed 
nonsignificant change in ASMR (EAPC: 0.06, 95 % CI: -0.01, 0.13) and slight 
increment in ASDR (EAPC: 0.30, 95 % CI: 0.23, 0.37). The EAPCs of ASMR and ASDR 
were negatively associated with SDI in 2019, while the low-middle SDI region 
exhibited the fastest growth of ASMR and ASDR with EAPCs of 3.25 (95 % CI: 3.14, 
3.37) and 3.36 (95 % CI: 3.22, 3.49), respectively. In conclusion, the global 
CVD burden attributable to ambient PM2.5 has largely increased over the past 
three decades. The population growth, aging and SDI contributed to the 
heterogeneity of spatial and temporal distribution. Enforcing policy to 
improving air quality is required to halt the growing burden of PM2.5 on health.

In sports situations, players may be required to throw at different speeds. The 
question of how skilled players throw the ball accurately to the desired 
location under different speed conditions is of interest to biomechanics 
researchers. Previous research suggested that throwers use different types of 
joint coordination. However, joint coordination with a change in throwing speed 
has not been studied. Here, we show the effects of changes in throwing speed on 
joint coordination during accurate overhead throwing. Participants were seated 
on a low chair with their trunk fixed and threw a baseball aimed at a target 
under 2 different speed conditions (slow and fast). In the slow condition, the 
elbow flexion/extension angle coordinated with other joint angles and angular 
velocities to reduce the variability of the vertical hand velocity. In the fast 
condition, the shoulder internal/external rotation angle and the shoulder 
horizontal flexion/extension angular velocity coordinated with other joint 
angles and angular velocities to reduce the variability of the vertical hand 
velocity. These results showed that joint coordination differed with changes in 
throwing speed, indicating that joint coordination is not always fixed, but may 
differ depending on the task constraints, such as throwing speed.

BACKGROUND: Primary care practitioners (PCPs) play a key role in cancer 
screening decisions for older adults (≥ 65 years), but recommendations vary by 
cancer type and jurisdiction.
PURPOSE: To examine the factors influencing PCPs' recommendations for breast, 
cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening for older adults.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Pre-Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL, searched from 
1 January 2000 to July 2021, and citation searching in July 2022.
STUDY SELECTION: Assessed factors influencing PCPs' breast, prostate, 
colorectal, or cervical cancer screening decisions for older adults' (defined 
either as ≥ 65 years or < 10-year life expectancy).
DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently conducted data extraction and quality 
appraisal. Decisions were crosschecked and discussed where necessary.
DATA SYNTHESIS: From 1926 records, 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty 
were quantitative, nine were qualitative, and one used a mixed method design. 
Twenty-nine were conducted in the USA, and one in the UK. Factors were 
synthesized into six categories: patient demographic characteristics, patient 
health characteristics, patient and clinician psycho-social factors, clinician 
characteristics, and health system factors. Patient preference was most reported 
as influential across both quantitative and qualitative studies. Age, health 
status, and life expectancy were also commonly influential, but PCPs held 
nuanced views about life expectancy. Weighing benefits/harms was also commonly 
reported with variation across cancer screening types. Other factors included 
patient screening history, clinician attitudes/personal experiences, 
patient/provider relationship, guidelines, reminders, and time.
LIMITATIONS: We could not conduct a meta-analysis due to variability in study 
designs and measurement. The vast majority of included studies were conducted in 
the USA.
CONCLUSIONS: Although PCPs play a role in individualizing cancer screening for 
older adults, multi-level interventions are needed to improve these decisions. 
Decision support should continue to be developed and implemented to support 
informed choice for older adults and assist PCPs to consistently provide 
evidence-based recommendations.

OBJECTIVES: Identification the optimal management intervention of sarcopenia is 
a concern of health systems. We aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of 
sarcopenia management strategies in Iran.
METHODS: We constructed a lifetime Markov model based on natural history. The 
strategies comparedincluded exercise training, nutritional supplements, whole 
body vibration (WBV), and various exercise interventions and nutritional 
supplement combinations. A total of 7 strategies was evaluated in addition to 
the non-intervention strategy. Parameter values were extracted from primary data 
and the literature, and the costs and Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 
calculated for each strategy. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, including the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), was also 
performed to determine the robustness of the model. Analyses were performed 
using the 2020 version of TreeAge Pro software.
RESULTS: All seven strategies increased lifetime effectiveness (QALYs). The 
protein and Vitamin D3 (P + D) strategy had the highest effectiveness values 
among all strategies. After removing the dominated strategies, the estimated 
ICER for the P + D compared to Vitamin D3 alone (D) strategy was calculated as 
$131,229. Considering the cost-effectiveness threshold ($25,249), base-case 
results indicated that the D strategy was the most cost-effective strategy in 
this evaluation. Sensitivity analysis of model parameters also demonstrated the 
robustness of results. Also, EVPI was estimated at $273.
CONCLUSIONS: Study results, as the first economic evaluation of sarcopenia 
management interventions, showed that despite the higher effectiveness of D + P, 
the D strategy was the most cost-effective. Completing clinical evidence of 
various intervention options can lead to more accurate results in the future.

BACKGROUND: Measurement of the Chinese burden of disease with 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) requires disability weight (DW) that 
quantify health losses for all non-fatal consequences of disease and injury. The 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 DW study indicates that it is limited by 
lack of geographic variation in DW data and by the current measurement 
methodology. We aim to estimate DW for a set of health states from major 
diseases in the Wuhan population.
METHODS: We conducted the DW measurement study for 206 health states through a 
household survey with computer-assisted face-to-face interviews and a web-based 
survey. Based on GBD 2013 DW study, paired comparison (PC) and Population health 
equivalence (PHE) method was used and different PC/PHE questions were randomly 
assigned to each respondent. In statistical analysis, the PC data was analyzed 
by probit regression. The probit regression results will be anchored by results 
from the PHE data analyzed by interval regression on the DW scale units between 
0 (no loss of health) and 1 (loss equivalent to death).
RESULTS: A total of 2610 and 3140 individuals were included in the household and 
web-based survey, respectively. The results from the total pooled data showed 
health state "mild anemia" (DW = 0.005, 95% UI 0.000-0.027) or "allergic 
rhinitis (hay fever)" (0.005, 95% UI 0.000-0.029) had the lowest DW and "heroin 
and other opioid dependence, severe" had the highest DW (0.699, 95% UI 
0.579-0.827). A high correlation coefficient (Pearson's r = 0.876; P < 0.001) 
for DWs of same health states was observed between Wuhan's survey and GBD 
2013 DW survey. Health states referred to mental symptom, fatigue, and the 
residual category of other physical symptoms were statistically significantly 
associated with a lower Wuhan's DWs than the GBD's DWs. Health states with 
disfigurement and substance use symptom had a higher DW in Wuhan population than 
the GBD 2013 study.
CONCLUSIONS: This set of DWs could be used to calculate local diseases burden 
for health policy-decision in Wuhan population. The DW differences between the 
GBD's survey and Wuhan's survey suggest that there might be some contextual or 
culture factors influencing assessment on the severity of diseases.
