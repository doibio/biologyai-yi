BACKGROUND: Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease. There is a sparsity of data 
on this disease with regard to the incidence of human and animal disease in many 
low and middle income countries. Furthermore, rabies results in a large economic 
impact and a high human burden of disease. Kazakhstan is a large landlocked 
middle income country that gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and 
is endemic for rabies.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used detailed public health and veterinary 
surveillance data from 2003 to 2015 to map where livestock rabies is occurring. 
We also estimate the economic impact and human burden of rabies. Livestock and 
canine rabies occurred over most of Kazakhstan, but there were regional 
variations in disease distribution. There were a mean of 7.1 officially recorded 
human fatalities due to rabies per year resulting in approximately 457 
Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). A mean of 64,289 individuals per annum 
underwent post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) which may have resulted in an 
additional 1140 DALYs annually. PEP is preventing at least 118 cases of human 
rabies each year or possibly as many as 1184 at an estimated cost of $1193 or 
$119 per DALY averted respectively. The estimated economic impact of rabies in 
Kazakhstan is $20.9 million per annum, with nearly half of this cost being 
attributed to the cost of PEP and the loss of income whilst being treated. A 
further $5.4 million per annum was estimated to be the life time loss of income 
for fatal cases. Animal vaccination programmes and animal control programmes 
also contributed substantially to the economic losses. The direct costs due to 
rabies fatalities of agricultural animals was relatively low.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that in Kazakhstan there is a 
substantial economic cost and health impact of rabies. These costs could be 
reduced by modifying the vaccination programme that is now practised. The study 
also fills some data gaps on the epidemiology and economic effects of rabies in 
respect to Kazakhstan.

Efmoroctocog Alfa: A Review in Haemophilia A.

demail@springer.com.

Efmoroctocog alfa (Elocta(®), Eloctate(®), Eloctate™), a first-in-class 
recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc), has an extended half-life 
compared with conventional factor VIII (FVIII) preparations, including 
recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products. It is approved for the treatment and 
prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A in multiple countries 
worldwide. Data accumulated from pivotal phase III studies (A-LONG in adults and 
adolescents aged ≥12 years; Kids A-LONG in children aged <12 years) and their 
ongoing extension study (ASPIRE) have demonstrated the long-term effectiveness 
of efmoroctocog alfa for the treatment of acute bleeding episodes, perioperative 
management and routine prophylaxis in previously treated males with severe 
haemophilia A. Among patients on individualized efmoroctocog alfa prophylaxis 
who had previously received FVIII prophylaxis, all but one of those aged 
≥12 years and three-quarters of those aged <12 years reduced their injection 
frequency compared with their pre-study regimen. FVIII replacement therapy with 
efmoroctocog alfa was generally well tolerated in previously treated patients, 
with no evidence of increased immunogenicity. The safety and efficacy of FVIII 
replacement therapy with efmoroctocog alfa in previously untreated males aged 
<6 years with severe haemophilia A are currently being evaluated. Although there 
are no direct, head-to-head studies, the available clinical trial evidence 
indicates that efmoroctocog alfa provides an effective alternative to 
conventional FVIII preparations (including rFVIIIs) for the management of 
haemophilia A. Moreover, by reducing the frequency of injections required, it 
has the potential to reduce treatment burden, and hence improve adherence to 
prophylaxis.

INTRODUCTION: Burn contractures hinder joint mobility, resulting in functional 
impairment and reduced quality of life. This is of greater significance in 
developing countries where there are fewer resources for assistance with such 
impairments. Contracture release reduces deformity, but multiple factors affect 
the extent of postsurgical improvements and outcomes. Elucidating these factors 
may enable surgeons to better care for burn patients. This study assesses 
factors that impact burn contracture resolution in developing nations.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 2506 burn contractures was performed using 
information extracted from a large nongovernment organization (ReSurge 
International) database from Nepal, India, and Zambia. Data points included age, 
type of burn, time elapsed between injury and release, and extent of final 
release achieved based on preoperative and postoperative images of hand (n = 
1960), elbow (n = 371), and knee (n = 176) contractures. Hand improvement was 
scored based on digit/wrist involvement (severity of dysfunction) and joint 
extension capability (functionality); elbow and knee improvement were calculated 
using preoperative and postoperative joint angles. Multivariate analysis was 
performed.
RESULTS: Hands burned by hot liquid had greater functionality after surgery than 
open-fire burns (P < 0.01). Improvement in severity of dysfunction and 
functionality were inversely correlated to age (P < 0.01) and time until surgery 
(P < 0.01). Elbow improvement decreased as age increased (P < 0.01). 
Postoperative increase of knee extension decreased for each year elapsed between 
injury and surgery (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Burn type, age when burned, and timing of surgery were significant 
factors affecting hand outcomes, whereas age affected elbow outcomes, and time 
elapsed until surgery affected knee results. An algorithm was formulated to 
enable physicians in developing countries with limited resources to triage 
patients and optimize patient outcomes.

As a result of significant improvements in current therapies, the life 
expectancy of cancer patients with bone metastases has dramatically improved. 
Unfortunately, these patients often experience skeletal complications that 
significantly impair their quality of life. The major skeletal complications 
associated with bone metastases include: cancer-induced bone pain, 
hypercalcemia, pathological bone fractures, metastatic epidural spinal cord 
compression and cancer cachexia. Once cancer cells invade the bone, they perturb 
the normal physiology of the marrow microenvironment, resulting in bone 
destruction, which is believed to be a direct cause of skeletal complications. 
However, full understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these 
complications remains unknown. In the present review, we discuss the 
complications associated with bone metastases along with matched conventional 
therapeutic strategies. A better understanding of this topic is crucial, as 
targeting skeletal complications can improve both the morbidity and mortality of 
patients suffering from bone metastases.

Erythropoietin and mTOR: A "One-Two Punch" for Aging-Related Disorders 
Accompanied by Enhanced Life Expectancy.

Life expectancy continues to increase throughout the world, but is accompanied 
by a rise in the incidence of non-communicable diseases. As a result, the 
benefits of an increased lifespan can be limited by aging-related disorders that 
necessitate new directives for the development of effective and safe treatment 
modalities. With this objective, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a 
289-kDa serine/threonine protein, and its related pathways of mTOR Complex 1 
(mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), proline rich Akt substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40), 
AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), Wnt signaling, and silent mating type 
information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1), have 
generated significant excitement for furthering novel therapies applicable to 
multiple systems of the body. Yet, the biological and clinical outcome of these 
pathways can be complex especially with oversight of cell death mechanisms that 
involve apoptosis and autophagy. Growth factors, and in particular 
erythropoietin (EPO), are one avenue under consideration to implement control 
over cell death pathways since EPO can offer potential treatment for multiple 
disease entities and is intimately dependent upon mTOR signaling. In 
experimental and clinical studies, EPO appears to have significant efficacy in 
treating several disorders including those involving the developing brain. 
However, in mature populations that are affected by aging-related disorders, the 
direction for the use of EPO to treat clinical disease is less clear that may be 
dependent upon a number of factors including the understanding of mTOR 
signaling. Continued focus upon the regulatory elements that control EPO and 
mTOR signaling could generate critical insights for targeting a broad range of 
clinical maladies.

An extremely high (about 100 %) increase in longevity is reported for a subset 
of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Drosophila melanogaster subjected to a 
cyclic heat stress throughout the adult life. Previous work showed that both 
longevity and heat sensitivity highly differed among RILs. The novel heat stress 
treatment used in this study consisted of 5 min at 38 °C applicated 
approximately every 125 min throughout the adult life starting at the age of 
2 days. In spite of the exceptionally high increase in longevity in a set of 
RILs, the same heat stress treatment reduced rather than increased longevity in 
other RILs, suggesting that heat-induced hormesis is dependent on the genotype 
and/or the genetic background. Further, one quantitative trait locus (QTL) was 
identified for heat-induced hormesis on chromosome 2 (bands 28A1-34D2) in one 
RIL panel (RIL-D48) but it was not significant in its reciprocal panel 
(RIL-SH2). The level of heat-induced hormesis showed a sexual dimorphism, with a 
higher number of lines exhibiting higher hormesis effects in males than in 
females. The new heat stress treatment in this study suggests that longevity can 
be further extended than previously suggested by applying a cyclic and mild 
stress throughout the life, depending on the genotype.

BACKGROUND: Smoking, physical inactivity and obesity are modifiable risk factors 
for morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to 
which the co-occurrence of these behaviour-related risk factors predict healthy 
life expectancy and chronic disease-free life expectancy in four European cohort 
studies.
METHODS: Data were drawn from repeated waves of four cohort studies in England, 
Finland, France and Sweden. Smoking status, physical inactivity and obesity 
(body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) were examined separately and in combination. Health 
expectancy was estimated by using two health indicators: suboptimal self-rated 
health and having a chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory 
disease and diabetes). Multistate life table models were used to estimate 
sex-specific healthy life expectancy and chronic disease-free life expectancy 
from ages 50 to 75 years.
RESULTS: Compared with men and women with at least two behaviour-related risk 
factors, those with no behaviour-related risk factors could expect to live on 
average8 years longer in good health and 6 years longer free of chronic diseases 
between ages 50 and 75. Having any single risk factor was also associated with 
reduction in healthy years. No consistent differences between cohorts were 
observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from four European countries show that persons with individual 
and co-occurring behaviour-related risk factors have shorter healthy life 
expectancy and shorter chronic disease-free life expectancy. Population level 
reductions in smoking, physical inactivity and obesity could increase life-years 
lived in good health.

BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews and a network meta-analysis show home safety 
education with or without the provision of safety equipment is effective in 
promoting poison prevention behaviours in households with children. This paper 
compares the cost-effectiveness of home safety interventions to promote poison 
prevention practices.
METHODS: A probabilistic decision-analytic model simulates healthcare costs and 
benefits for a hypothetical cohort of under 5 year olds. The model compares the 
cost-effectiveness of home safety education, home safety inspections, provision 
of free or low cost safety equipment and fitting of equipment. Analyses are 
conducted from a UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services 
perspective and expressed in 2012 prices.
RESULTS: Education without safety inspection, provision or fitting of equipment 
was the most cost-effective strategy for promoting safe storage of medicines 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £2888 (95 % credible interval 
(CrI) £1990-£5774) per poison case avoided or £41,330 (95%CrI £20,007-£91,534) 
per QALY gained compared with usual care. Compared to usual care, home safety 
interventions were not cost-effective in promoting safe storage of other 
household products.
CONCLUSION: Education offers better value for money than more intensive but 
expensive strategies for preventing medicinal poisonings, but is only likely to 
be cost-effective at £30,000 per QALY gained for families in disadvantaged areas 
and for those with more than one child. There was considerable uncertainty in 
cost-effectiveness estimates due to paucity of evidence on model parameters. 
Policy makers should consider both costs and effectiveness of competing 
interventions to ensure efficient use of resources.

BACKGROUND: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive form of 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bortezomib is the first product to be approved for the 
treatment of patients with previously untreated MCL, for whom haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation is unsuitable, and is used in combination with 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (VR-CAP). 
The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recently recommended the 
use of VR-CAP in the UK following a technology appraisal. We present the cost 
effectiveness analysis performed as part of that assessment: VR-CAP versus the 
current standard of care regimen of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) in a UK setting.
METHODS: A lifetime economic model was developed with health states based upon 
line of treatment and progression status. Baseline patient characteristics, 
dosing, safety and efficacy were based on the LYM-3002 trial. As overall 
survival data were immature, survival was modelled by progression status, and 
post-progression survival was assumed equal across arms. Utilities were derived 
from LYM-3002 and literature, and standard UK cost sources were used.
RESULTS: Treatment with VR-CAP compared to R-CHOP gave an incremental 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.81 at an additional cost of £16,212, 
resulting in a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £20,043. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that treatment with 
VR-CAP was cost effective at conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds 
(£20,000-£30,000 per QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: VR-CAP is a cost-effective option for previously untreated patients 
with MCL in the UK.

BACKGROUND: The number of elderly patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery has 
recently increased. We therefore evaluated the short- and long-term outcomes of 
elderly patients after curative gastrectomy.
METHODS: Overall, 824 patients were included in this retrospective study, which 
comprised of a non-elderly group (60-64 years; n = 558), an early-elderly group 
(75-79 years; n = 198), and a late-elderly group (≥80 years; n = 68) who 
underwent curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer between 2005 and 2009. 
Postoperative complications, according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, and 
survival of both elderly groups were compared with the non-elderly group. 
Postoperative life expectancy of the late-elderly group was compared with the 
corresponding aged general population.
RESULTS: Overall and severe (grade III or higher) complications in the 
early-elderly group were comparable with the non-elderly group; however, those 
in the late-elderly group were significantly more common than in the non-elderly 
group (p = 0.013 and p = 0.043, respectively). Multivariable analysis revealed 
that age ≥80 years was an independent risk factor for severe complications 
(hazard ratio 3.02, 95 % confidence interval 1.12-8.17; p = 0.029), and the 
disease-specific survivals of both elderly groups were comparable with the 
non-elderly group in all TNM stages. Postoperative life expectancy of 
late-elderly patients eliminating death from recurrence was comparable with the 
corresponding aged general population eliminating death from gastric cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Gastric cancer surgery in elderly patients aged ≥80 years achieves 
reasonable long-term survival despite the increased risk of severe 
complications.

BACKGROUND: People with intellectual disabilities (IDs) die at younger ages than 
the general population, but nationally representative and internationally 
comparable mortality data about people with ID, quantifying the extent and 
pattern of the excess, have not previously been reported for England.
METHOD: We used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database for 
April 2010 to March 2014 (CPRD GOLD September 2015). This source covered several 
hundred participating general practices comprising roughly 5% of the population 
of England in the period studied. General practitioner (GP) records identified 
people diagnosed by their GP as having ID. Linked national death certification 
data allowed us to derive corresponding mortality data for people with and 
without ID, overall and by cause.
RESULTS: Mortality rates for people with ID were significantly higher than for 
those without. Their all-cause standardised mortality ratio was 3.18. Their life 
expectancy at birth was 19.7 years lower than for people without ID. Circulatory 
and respiratory diseases and neoplasms were the three most common causes of 
death for them. Cerebrovascular disease, thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism 
all had standardised mortality ratios greater than 3 in people with ID. This has 
not been described before. Other potentially avoidable causes included epilepsy 
(3.9% of deaths), aspiration pneumonitis (3.6%) and colorectal cancer (2.4%). 
Avoidable mortality analysis showed a higher proportion of deaths from causes 
classified as amenable to good medical care but a lower proportion from 
preventable causes compared with people without ID. International comparison to 
areas for which data have been published in sufficient detail for calculation of 
directly standardised rates suggest England may have higher death rates for 
people with ID than areas in Canada and Finland, and lower death rates than 
Ireland or the State of Massachusetts in the USA.
CONCLUSIONS: National data about mortality in people with ID provides a basis 
for public health interventions. Linked data using GP records to identify people 
with ID could provide comprehensive population-based monitoring in England, 
unbiased by the circumstances of illnesses or death; to date information 
governance constraints have prevented this. However, GPs in England currently 
identify only around 0.5% of the population as having ID, suggesting that 
individuals with mild, non-syndromic ID are largely missed. Notably common 
causes of death suggest control of cardiovascular risk factors, epilepsy and 
dysphagia, management of thrombotic risks and colorectal screening are important 
areas for health promotion initiatives.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and assess the quality of the novel drugs' 
economic evaluation literature in print during the drugs' early commercial 
availability following US regulatory approval.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and the United Kingdom National Health Service Economic 
Evaluation Database were searched from 1946 through December 2011 for economic 
evaluations of the 50 novel drugs approved by the FDA in 2008 and 2009.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The inclusion criteria were 
English-language, peer-reviewed, original economic evaluations (cost-utility, 
cost-effectiveness, cost-minimization, and cost-benefit analyses). We extracted 
and analyzed data from 36 articles considering 19 of the 50 drugs. Two reviewers 
assessed each publication's quality using the Quality of Health Economic Studies 
(QHES) instrument and summarized study quality on a 100-point scale.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Study quality had a mean of 70.0 ± 16.2 QHES points. The only 
study characteristics associated with QHES score (with P < 0.05) were having 
used modeling or advanced statistics, 75.1 versus 61.9 without; using 
quality-adjusted life years as an outcome, 75.9 versus 64.7 without; and 
cost-utility versus cost-minimization analysis, 75.9 versus 58.7. Studies most 
often satisfied quality aspects about stating study design choices and least 
often satisfied aspects about justifying design choices.
CONCLUSION: The reviewed literature considered a minority of the 2008-2009 novel 
drugs and had mixed study quality. Cost-effectiveness stakeholders might benefit 
from efforts to improve the quality and quantity of literature examining novel 
drugs. Editors and reviewers may support quality improvement by stringently 
imposing economic evaluation guidelines about justifying study design choices.

Care of Patients at the End of Life: Advance Care Planning.

Ackermann RJ(1).

College Street, Macon, GA 31207-0001.

Advance directives are legal documents that give instructions about how to 
provide care when patients develop life-threatening illnesses and can no longer 
communicate their wishes. Two types of documents are widely used-a living will 
and a durable power of attorney for health care. Most states also authorize 
physician orders for life-sustaining treatment. Physicians should encourage 
patients, particularly those with severe chronic or terminal conditions, to 
prepare advance directives. Medicare now reimburses billing codes for advance 
care consultations. Directions regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 
artificial ventilation often are included in advance care plans, and use of 
artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) also should be addressed, particularly 
for patients with advanced dementia. Evidence shows that in such patients, ANH 
does not prolong survival, increase comfort, or improve quality of life. Given 
the lack of benefit, physicians should recommend against use of ANH for patients 
with dementia. Finally, physicians should encourage use of hospice services by 
patients whose life expectancy is 6 months or less. Although Medicare and most 
other health care insurers cover hospice care, and despite evidence that patient 
and family satisfaction increase when hospice services are used, many patients 
do not use these services.

BACKGROUND: Prospective, population-based study of an 8-year follow up. To 
determine the direct cost of diabetic retinopathy [DR], evaluating our screening 
programme and the cost of treating DR, focusing on diabetic macular oedema [DMO] 
after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [anti-VEGF] treatment.
METHODS: A total of 15,396 diabetes mellitus [DM] patients were studied. We 
determined the cost-effectiveness of our screening programme against an annual 
programme by applying the Markov simulation model. We also compared the 
cost-effectiveness of anti-VEGF treatment to laser treatment for screened 
patients with DMO.
RESULTS: The cost of our 2.5-year screening programme was as follows: per 
patient with any-DR, €482.85 ± 35.14; per sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy 
[STDR] patient, €1528.26 ± 114.94; and €1826.98 ± 108.26 per DMO patient. 
Comparatively, an annual screening programme would result in increases as 
follows: 0.77 in QALY per patient with any-DR and 0.6 and 0.44 per patient with 
STDR or DMO, respectively, with an incremental cost-effective ratio [ICER] of 
€1096.88 for any-DR, €4571.2 for STDR and €7443.28 per DMO patient. Regarding 
diagnosis and treatment, the mean annual total cost per patient with DMO was 
€777.09 ± 49.45 for the laser treated group and €7153.62 ± 212.15 for the 
anti-VEGF group, with a QALY gain of 0.21, the yearly mean cost was 
€7153.62 ± 212.15 per patient, and the ICER was €30,361.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for diabetic retinopathy every 2.5 years is 
cost-effective, but should be adjusted to a patient's personal risk factors. 
Treatment with anti-VEGF for DMO has increased costs, but the cost-utility 
increases to 0.21 QALY per patient.

Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. William.Marks@ucsf.edu.

OBJECTIVES: Deep brain stimulation (DBS), which uses an implantable device to 
modulate brain activity, is clinically superior to medical therapy for treating 
advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). We studied the cost-effectiveness of DBS in 
conjunction with medical therapy compared to best medical therapy (BMT) alone, 
using the latest clinical and cost data for the U.S. healthcare system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a decision-analytic state-transition (Markov) 
model to project PD progression and associated costs for the two treatment 
strategies. We estimated the discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) in U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from the Medicare 
payer perspective, considering a ten-year horizon, and evaluated the robustness 
of our projections through extensive deterministic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Over ten years, DBS treatment led to discounted total costs of $130,510 
compared to $91,026 for BMT and added 1.69 QALYs more than BMT, resulting in an 
ICER of $23,404 per QALY. This ICER was relatively insensitive to variations in 
input parameters, with neurostimulator replacement, costs for DBS implantation, 
and costs for treatment of disease-related falls having the greatest effects. 
Across all investigated scenarios, including a five-year horizon, ICERs remained 
under $50,000 per QALY. Longer follow-up periods and younger treatment age were 
associated with greater cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: DBS is a cost-effective treatment strategy for advanced PD in the 
U.S. healthcare system across a wide range of assumptions. DBS yields 
substantial improvements in health-related quality of life at a value profile 
that compares favorably to other well-accepted therapies.

BACKGROUND: The ability of Yersinia pestis to form a biofilm is an important 
characteristic in flea transmission of this pathogen. Y. pestis laterally 
acquired two plasmids (pPCP1and pMT1) and the ability to form biofilms when it 
evolved from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are 
thought to play a crucial role in the processes of biofilm formation and 
pathogenesis.
RESULTS: A pPCP1-derived sRNA HmsA (also known as sR084) was found to contribute 
to the enhanced biofilm formation phenotype of Y. pestis. The concentration of 
c-di-GMP was significantly reduced upon deletion of the hmsA gene in Y. pestis. 
The abundance of mRNA transcripts determining exopolysaccharide production, 
crucial for biofilm formation, was measured by primer extension, RT-PCR and lacZ 
transcriptional fusion assays in the wild-type and hmsA mutant strains. HmsA 
positively regulated biofilm synthesis-associated genes (hmsHFRS, hmsT and 
hmsCDE), but had no regulatory effect on the biofilm degradation-associated gene 
hmsP. Interestingly, the recently identified biofilm activator sRNA, HmsB, was 
rapidly degraded in the hmsA deletion mutant. Two genes (rovM and rovA) 
functioning as biofilm regulators were also found to be regulated by HmsA, whose 
regulatory effects were consistent with the HmsA-mediated biofilm phenotype.
CONCLUSION: HmsA potentially functions as an activator of biofilm formation in 
Y. pestis, implying that sRNAs encoded on the laterally acquired plasmids might 
be involved in the chromosome-based regulatory networks implicated in Y. 
pestis-specific physiological processes.

BACKGROUND: Pegylated interferon alpha 2a, alpha 2b and ribavirin have been 
included to the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) for treatment of 
only chronic hepatitis C genotypes 2 and 3 in Thailand. This reimbursement 
policy has not covered for other genotypes of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) 
especially for genotypes 1 and 6 that account for 30-50 % of all HCV infection 
in Thailand. Therefore, this research determined whether pegylated interferon 
alpha 2a or alpha 2b plus ribavirin is more cost-effective than a palliative 
care for treatment of HCV genotype 1 and 6 in Thailand.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using a model-based economic evaluation was 
conducted based on a societal perspective. A Markov model was developed to 
estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) comparing between the 
combination of pegylated interferon alpha 2a or alpha 2b and ribavirin with a 
usual palliative care for genotype 1 and 6 HCV patients. Health-state transition 
probabilities, virological responses, and utility values were obtained from 
published literatures. Direct medical and direct non-medical costs were included 
and retrieved from published articles and Thai Standard Cost List for Health 
Technology Assessment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
presented as costs in Thai baht per QALY gained.
RESULTS: HCV treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 2a or alpha 2b plus 
ribavirin was dominant or cost-saving in Thailand compared to a palliative care. 
The ICER value was negative with lower in total costs (peg 2a- 747,718vs. peg 
2b- 819,921 vs. palliative care- 1,169,121 Thai baht) and more in QALYs (peg 2a- 
13.44 vs. peg 2b- 13.14 vs. palliative care- 11.63 years) both in HCV genotypes 
1 and 6.
CONCLUSION: As cost-saving results, the Subcommittee for Development of the NLEM 
decided to include both pegylated interferon alpha 2a and alpha 2b into the NLEM 
for treatment of HCV genotype 1 and 6 recently. Economic evaluation for these 
current drugs can be further applied to other novel medications for HCV 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition, which is associated with increased medical 
complications in older hospitalized patients, can be attenuated by providing 
nutritional supplements.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost effectiveness of a specialized oral 
nutritional supplement (ONS) in malnourished older hospitalized patients.
METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation alongside a multicenter, 
randomized, controlled clinical trial (NOURISH Study). The target population was 
malnourished older hospitalized patients in the USA. We used 90-day (base case) 
and lifetime (sensitivity analysis) time horizons. The study compared a 
nutrient-dense ONS, containing high protein and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate to 
placebo. Outcomes included health-care costs, measured as the product of 
resource use and per unit cost; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (90-day time 
horizon); life-years (LYs) saved (lifetime time horizon); and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). All costs were inflated to 2015 US dollars.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, 90-day treatment group costs averaged 
US$22,506 per person, compared to US$22,133 for the control group. Treatment 
group patients gained 0.011 more QALYs than control group subjects, reflecting 
the treatment group's significantly greater probability of survival through 
90 days' follow-up, as reported by the clinical trial. Hence, the 90-day 
follow-up period ICER was US$33,818/QALY. Assuming a lifetime time horizon, 
estimated treatment group life expectancy exceeded control group life expectancy 
by 0.71 years. Hence, the lifetime ICER was US$524/LY. The follow-up period for 
the trial was relatively short. Some of the patients were lost to follow-up, 
thus reducing collection of health-care utilization data during the clinical 
trial.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the investigative ONS cost-effectively 
extends the lives of malnourished hospitalized patients.

Given the dramatic increase in the number of total knee replacement (TKR) 
surgeries in developed countries, the issue of the best time for surgery needs 
to be addressed from an economic perspective.
OBJECTIVE: To assess, from the perspective of the healthcare payer, the 
cost-utility of two surgical strategies in which knee replacement is performed 
at the early or late stage of the disease in patients with knee osteoarthritis 
(OA).
DESIGN: Patient data and evidence from published literature on economic costs 
and outcomes in OA, including utilities, non-pharmacological, pharmacological 
and surgical options, combined with population life tables were entered in a 
Markov model of OA. The model represented the lifetime experience of a cohort of 
patients following their therapeutic management, discounting costs (euros) and 
utilities (quality-adjusted life-years) at 4% annually.
RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, early TKR cost €6,624 more than late TKR 
(€76,223 vs €69,599) with a 0.15 gain in QALYs (18.675 vs 18.524). This yielded 
an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of 43,631 €/QALY. Sensitivity analyses 
of the most influential uncertain parameters were performed and did not modify 
the direction of the conclusions: early TKR cost between €3,655 and €7,194 more 
than late TKR with a gain in QALYs between 0.15 and 0.39. The ICUR ranged from 
17,131 €/QALY to 48,241 €/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Our data do not support the early TKR strategy over the late TKR 
strategy in knee OA patients from a medico-economic perspective.

BACKGROUND: After the advent of the potent combination antiretroviral therapy 
(cART) the incidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has declined 
dramatically and HIV infection became a chronic disease with a significant 
increase in the life expectancy of HIV-positive people. Consequently, chronic 
comorbidities as coronary heart disease raised an increasing concern in this 
population.
OBJECTIVE: Aim of this editorial article is to review the most recent data about 
the cardiovascular disease risk among HIV-positive persons and to suggest an 
appropriate clinical management.
RESULTS: An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been reported among 
HIVinfected subjects compared to the general population, but the pathogenic 
mechanism of this accelerated atherosclerotic process is complex and certainly 
multifactorial. The occurrence of myocardial infarction may be the consequence 
of traditional risk factors (that are overrepresented in the HIVinfected 
population), direct viral replication, and long-term toxicity of the 
antiretroviral drugs. Moreover, despite the persistent viral suppression induced 
by cART usually reduces the cardiovascular risk, several studies show in 
HIV-positive subjects a condition of chronic inflammation and immune activation 
that could lead to both accelerated endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic 
disease.
CONCLUSION: The cardiovascular risk reduction and coronary heart disease 
prevention are today a leading challenge for all the clinicians involved in the 
HIV patients' care.

AIDS is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and, currently, the overall 
prevalence rate of HIV infection in Brazil is 0.5% among men and 0.3% among 
women.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the spatiotemporal trend of AIDS in Brazil from 2006 to 
2012 and its relationship with human development index (HDI) and their
