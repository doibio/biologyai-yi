IMPORTANCE: Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids are now available in the US; 
however, their clinical and economic outcomes are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To project the clinical and economic outcomes of traditional hearing 
aid provision compared with OTC hearing aid provision.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cost-effectiveness analysis used a 
previously validated decision model of hearing loss (HL) to simulate US adults 
aged 40 years and older across their lifetime in US primary care offices who 
experienced yearly probabilities of acquiring HL (0.1%-10.4%), worsening of 
their HL, and traditional hearing aid uptake (0.5%-8.1%/y at a fixed uptake cost 
of $3690) and utility benefits (0.11 additional utils/y). For OTC hearing aid 
provision, persons with perceived mild to moderate HL experienced increased OTC 
hearing aid uptake (1%-16%/y) based on estimates of time to first HL diagnosis. 
In the base case, OTC hearing aid utility benefits ranged from 0.05 to 0.11 
additional utils/y (45%-100% of traditional hearing aids), and costs were $200 
to $1400 (5%-38% of traditional hearing aids). Distributions were assigned to 
parameters to conduct probabilistic uncertainty analysis.
INTERVENTION: Provision of OTC hearing aids, at increased uptake rates, across a 
range of effectiveness and costs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime undiscounted and discounted (3%/y) costs 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Traditional hearing aid provision resulted in 18.162 QALYs, compared 
with 18.162 to 18.186 for OTC hearing aids varying with OTC hearing aid utility 
benefit (45%-100% that of traditional hearing aids). Provision of OTC hearing 
aids was associated with greater lifetime discounted costs by $70 to $200 along 
with OTC device cost ($200-$1000/pair; 5%-38% traditional hearing aid cost) due 
to increased hearing aid uptake. Provision of OTC hearing aids was considered 
cost-effective (ICER<$100 000/QALY) if the OTC utility benefit was 0.06 or 
greater (55% of the traditional hearing aid effectiveness). In probabilistic 
uncertainty analysis, OTC hearing aid provision was cost-effective in 53% of 
simulations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, provision of OTC 
hearing aids was associated with greater uptake of hearing intervention and was 
cost-effective over a range of prices so long as OTC hearing aids were greater 
than 55% as beneficial to patient quality of life as traditional hearing aids.

BACKGROUND: With the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the life expectancy of 
people living with HIV (PLWH) is gradually increasing, but subclinical 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is becoming increasingly common in PLWH.
METHODS: We obtained data from 326 PLWH. Based on the results of carotid 
ultrasonography, we divided patients into normal and abnormal carotid ultrasound 
groups and performed the χ2 test and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to 
determine the influencing factors of abnormal carotid ultrasound.
RESULTS: Among the 326 PLWH, the overall abnormality rate of carotid ultrasound 
was 31.9% (104/326). MCA showed that carotid ultrasound abnormalities were 
markedly more common in patients with age (non-youth), BMI ≥24.0 kg/m2, 
hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, ART treatment ≥5 years, and CD4+T 
lymphocyte count <200/μL.
CONCLUSION: Carotid ultrasound is more likely to be abnormal when PLWH have 
higher age, BMI ≥24.0 kg/m2, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, a longer 
course of ART, and a low CD4+ T lymphocyte count.

Five Failures and Five Challenges for Prevention and Early Intervention for 
Personality Disorder.

University of Melbourne, Australia.

Despite global consensus regarding the early detection of personality disorder, 
current approaches to early intervention have failed to deliver for the majority 
of young people. This only serves to reinforce the enduring effects of 
personality disorder on functioning, mental and physical health, resulting in a 
reduction of quality of life and life expectancy. Here, we describe five 
significant challenges facing prevention and early intervention for personality 
disorder: identification, access to treatment, research translation, innovation 
and functional recovery. These challenges highlight the need for early 
intervention to shift from niche programmes in specialist services for a select 
few young people to become established in mainstream primary care and specialist 
youth mental health services. Reprinted from Curr Opin Psychol 2021; 37:134-138,

BACKGROUND: The Mental Well-being Adjusted Life Year (MWALY) is an alternative 
outcome measure to the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in economic evaluations 
of interventions aimed at improving mental well-being. However, there is a lack 
of preference-based mental well-being instruments for capturing population 
mental well-being preferences.
OBJECTIVES: To derive a UK preference-based value set for the Short 
Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS).
METHODS: 225 participants that were interviewed between December 2020 and August 
2021 completed 10 composite time trade-off (C-TTO) and 10 discrete choice 
experiment (DCE) interviewer-administered exercises. Heteroskedastic Tobit and 
conditional logit models were used to model C-TTO and DCE responses 
respectively. The DCE utility values were rescaled to a C-TTO comparable scale 
through anchoring and mapping. An inverse variance weighting hybrid model 
(IVWHM) was used to derive weighted-average coefficients from the modelled C-TTO 
and DCE coefficients. Model performance was assessed using statistical 
diagnostics.
RESULTS: The valuation responses confirmed the feasibility and face validity of 
the C-TTO and DCE techniques. Apart from the main effects models, statistically 
significant associations were estimated between the predicted C-TTO value and 
participants' SWEMWBS scores, gender, ethnicities, education levels, and the 
interaction terms between age and useful feeling. The IVWHM was the most optimal 
model with the fewest logically inconsistent coefficients and the lowest pooled 
standard errors. The utility values generated by the rescaled DCE models and the 
IVWHM were generally higher than those of the C-TTO model. The predictive 
ability of the two DCE rescaling methods was similar according to the mean 
absolute deviation and root mean square deviation statistics.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has produced the first preference-based value set for a 
measure of mental well-being. The IVWHM provided a desirable blend of both C-TTO 
and DCE models. The value set derived by this hybrid approach can be used for 
cost-utility analyses of mental well-being interventions.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of the efficiency of interventions is paramount to 
achieving equitable health-care systems. One key barrier to the widespread use 
of economic evaluations in resource allocation decisions is the absence of a 
widely accepted method to define cost-effectiveness thresholds to judge whether 
an intervention is cost-effective in a particular jurisdiction. We aimed to 
develop a method to estimate cost-effectiveness thresholds on the basis of 
health expenditures per capita and life expectancy at birth and empirically 
derive these thresholds for 174 countries.
METHODS: We developed a conceptual framework to assess how the adoption and 
coverage of new interventions with a given incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
will affect the rate of increase of health expenditures per capita and life 
expectancy at the population level. The cost-effectiveness threshold can be 
derived so that the effect of new interventions on the evolution of life 
expectancy and health expenditure per capita is set within predefined goals. To 
provide guidance on cost-effectiveness thresholds and secular trends for 174 
countries, we projected country-level health expenditure per capita and life 
expectancy increases by income level based on World Bank data for the period 
2010-19.
FINDINGS: Cost-effectiveness thresholds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
ranged between US$87 (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and $95 958 (USA) and 
were less than 0·5 gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 96% of low-income 
countries, 76% of lower-middle-income countries, 31% of upper-middle-income 
countries, and 26% of high-income countries. Cost-effectiveness thresholds per 
QALY were less than 1 GDP per capita in 168 (97%) of the 174 countries. 
Cost-effectiveness thresholds per life-year ranged between $78 and $80 529 and 
between 0·12 and 1·24 GDP per capita, and were less than 1 GDP per capita in 171 
(98%) countries.
INTERPRETATION: This approach, based on widely available data, can provide a 
useful reference for countries using economic evaluations to inform 
resource-allocation decisions and can enrich international efforts to estimate 
cost-effectiveness thresholds. Our results show lower thresholds than those 
currently in use in many countries.

During virus entry, the pretriggered human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) 
envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer initially transits into a default 
intermediate state (DIS) that remains structurally uncharacterized. Here, we 
present cryo-EM structures at near-atomic resolution of two cleaved full-length 
HIV-1 Env trimers purified from cell membranes in styrene-maleic acid lipid 
nanoparticles without antibodies or receptors. The cleaved Env trimers exhibited 
tighter subunit packing than uncleaved trimers. Cleaved and uncleaved Env 
trimers assumed remarkably consistent yet distinct asymmetric conformations, 
with one smaller and two larger opening angles. Breaking conformational symmetry 
is allosterically coupled with dynamic helical transformations of the gp41 
N-terminal heptad repeat (HR1N) regions in two protomers and with trimer tilting 
in the membrane. The broken symmetry of the DIS potentially assists Env binding 
to two CD4 receptors-while resisting antibody binding-and promotes extension of 
the gp41 HR1 helical coiled-coil, which relocates the fusion peptide closer to 
the target cell membrane.

A wildfire, an unplanned fire that is mainly uncontrolled and originates in 
combustible vegetation in rural or urban settings, is one of the most pervasive 
natural catastrophes in some areas, such as Siberia, California and Australia. 
Many studies, such as standard reviews, have been undertaken to look into the 
works of literature on wildfires or forest fires and their effects on aquatic 
and terrestrial ecosystems. Regrettably, conventional literature reviews failed 
to identify the important researchers, evolving complexities, emerging research 
hotspots, trends and opportunities for further research on the ground of 
wildfire study. The present study employs bibliometric analysis to investigate 
this study area qualitatively and quantitatively. The Scopus database systems 
and Web of Science Core Collection yielded 78 qualifying papers, which were then 
evaluated using Biblioshiny (A bibliometrix tool of R-studio). According to the 
statistics, the discipline is expanding at a pace that is 13.68% faster than 
average. So far, three key periods of transformation have been documented: 
preliminary evolution (8 articles; 1999-2005), gentle evolution (14 articles; 
2006-2013) and quick evolution (56 articles; 2014 to 2021). Forest Ecology and 
Management and Science journals have the highest number of publications, 
accounting for 7.70% of total wildfire-related articles published from 1999 to 
2021. However, recent data indicate that investigators are shifting their focus 
to wildfires, with the term 'Australia' having the highest frequency (91) and 
'wildfire' having the second highest (58) as the most appeared keywords. The 
present study will provide a foundation for future research on wildfire 
incidence and management by receiving information by synthesising previously 
published literature in Australia and around the world.

The successful mass-rearing of potential biological control agents is a 
prerequisite for sustainable pest control. In this study, the performance of 3 
Trichogramma euproctidis (Girault) (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) populations 
collected from different locations in Khuzestan (Southwest Iran) were evaluated 
to optimize the egg parasitoid mass-rearing for augmentative biological control 
of lepidopteran pests. We aimed to investigate the effects of both population 
origin and host quality on biological traits of ovipositing females (number of 
parasitized eggs) and of their progeny (development time, survival rate, sex 
ratio, longevity, and fecundity). The effect of host quality was assessed by 
allowing the parasitoid to oviposit into 1, 2, 3, or 4-day-old Ephestia 
kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) eggs. The 3 T. euproctidis 
populations developed successfully regardless the age of the host eggs. However, 
we found significant variation among populations and a strong influence of host 
quality on the traits investigated. Progeny performance in all populations 
decreased with increasing host age. The best-performing population (collected in 
Mollasani) showed the highest parasitization rate, highest survival rate, and 
progeny sex ratio with the greatest percentage of females. A life table 
corroborated these findings with superior estimates of the net reproductive rate 
(R0), intrinsic rate of increase (r), and reduced generation time (T) for the 
Mollasani population on 1-day-old host eggs. We conclude that ample variation 
exists among T. euproctidis populations and that rearing the Mollasani 
population on young rather than old eggs of E. kuehniella would be recommended 
to implement the biological control programs to target lepidopteran pests in 
Southwestern Iran.

Clinical and pathological differences of breast cancer in younger and elderly 
patients.

Tasci HI.

AIM: It is known that breast cancers seen in younger and elderly patients have a 
worse prognosis than the disease seen in middle age. This study aimed at 
revealing the clinical and pathological differences of the disease and 
investigating the factors that may have an effect on survival and disease-free 
survival in very young and elderly female patients who were treated and followed 
up for breast cancer in our clinics.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: The data of female patients who were diagnosed with breast 
cancer in our clinics between January 2000 and January 2021 were analyzed. 
Patients aged 35 years and below were assigned to younger group, while those 
aged 65 years and over were assigned to the elderly group. Clinical and 
pathological data of groups were analyzed.
RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrated no difference in mortality rates 
and overall survival compared to younger patients, despite the comorbidities and 
short life expectancy of elderly patients. Moreover, younger patients were found 
to have a larger tumor size at diagnosis, a higher recurrence rate, and shorter 
disease-free survival compared to elderly patients. Furthermore, young age was 
associated with an increased risk of recurrence.
CONCLUSION: The data of our study reveals that breast cancer seen in younger 
patients has a worse prognosis than in elderly patients. There is a need for 
large-scale randomized controlled studies to reveal all the underlying causes 
and to develop more effective treatment strategies in order to avoid the poor 
prognosis of young age-onset breast cancers.
KEY WORDS: Breast cancer, Disease-free survival, Elderly patients, Overall 
survival, Prognosis, Younger patients.

Publisher: SCOPO: È noto che i tumori al seno osservati nelle pazienti di età 
giovane e avanzata hanno una prognosi peggiore rispetto alla malattia osservata 
nella mezza età a causa di ragioni diverse a seconda della fascia di età. Lo 
scopo di questo studio è di rivelare le differenze cliniche e patologiche della 
malattia ed esaminare i fattori che possono avere un effetto sulla sopravvivenza 
e sulla sopravvivenza libera da malattia in pazienti di sesso femminile di età 
giovani e avanzate trattate e seguite per tumore del seno nella nostra clinica.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: I dati delle pazienti di sesso femminile con diagnosi del 
tumore al seno nella nostra clinica tra gennaio 2000 e gennaio 2021 sono stati 
analizzati retrospettivamente. I dati clinici e patologici sono stati analizzati 
dividendo le pazienti in due gruppi come le pazienti di età inferiore a 35 anni 
è il gruppo di giovani e le pazienti di età superiore a 65 anni è il gruppo di 
età avanzata.
RISULTATI: Secondo i risultati del nostro studio, è stato osservato che non vi 
era alcuna differenza nei tassi di mortalità e sopravvivenza generale tra le 
pazienti di età avanzata, nonostante le malattie concomitanti e la breve 
aspettativa di vita, e le pazienti di età giovane. Inoltre, è stato determinato 
che il tumore delle pazienti più giovani tende ad essere una dimensione più 
grande dal momento della diagnosi, il tasso di recidività è più elevata e il 
tempo di sopravvivenza libera da malattia è più breve rispetto alle pazienti più 
anziane. È stato anche riscontrato che essere nella fascia di età giovane è un 
fattore che aumenta il rischio di recidività.
CONCLUSIONE: I dati del nostro studio rivelano che il tumore del seno osservato 
nelle pazienti più giovani ha una prognosi peggiore rispetto alle pazienti più 
anziane. Al fine di prevenire questa prognosi cattiva nelle giovani pazienti con 
carcinoma mammario, sono necessari studi randomizzati controllati su larga 
partecipante per rivelare tutte le cause sottostanti e sviluppare le strategie 
di trattamento più efficaci.

As the life expectancy improves in cystic fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction is 
becoming an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Here, the 
association of cardiac dysfunction with proinflammatory markers and 
neurohormones between cystic fibrosis patients and healthy children was 
investigated. Echocardiographic measurements of right and left ventricular 
morphology and functions together with levels of proinflammatory markers and 
neurohormones (renin, angiotensin-II, and aldosterone) were obtained and 
analysed in a study group of 21 cystic fibrosis children aged 5-18 years and 
compared with age- and gender-matched healthy children. It was shown that 
patients had significantly higher interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, renin and 
aldosterone levels (p < 0.05), dilated right ventricles, decreased left 
ventricle sizes, as well as both right and left ventricular dysfunction. These 
echocardiographic changes correlated with hypoxia, interleukin-1 α, 
interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and aldosterone (p < 0.05) levels. The 
current study revealed that hypoxia, proinflammatory markers, and neurohormones 
are major determinants of subclinical changes in ventricular morphology and 
function. While the right ventricle anatomy was affected by cardiac remodeling, 
the left ventricle changes were induced by right ventricle dilation and hypoxia. 
A significant but subclinical systolic and diastolic right ventricle dysfunction 
in our patients was associated with hypoxia and inflammatory markers. Systolic 
left ventricle function was affected by hypoxia and neurohormones. 
Echocardiography is a reliable and non-invasive method that is used safely in 
cystic fibrosis children for screening and detection of cardiac anatomical and 
functional changes. Extensive studies are needed to determine the time and 
frequency of screening and treatment suggestions for such changes.

INTRODUCTION: Latin American Initiative for Lifestyle Intervention to Prevent 
Cognitive Decline (LatAm-FINGERS) is the first non-pharmacological multicenter 
randomized clinical trial (RCT) to prevent cognitive impairment in Latin America 
(LA). Our aim is to present the study design and discuss the strategies used for 
multicultural harmonization.
METHODS: This 1-year RCT (working on a 1-year extension) investigates the 
feasibility of a multi-domain lifestyle intervention in LA and the efficacy of 
the intervention, primarily on cognitive function. An external harmonization 
process was carried out to follow the FINGER model, and an internal 
harmonization was performed to ensure this study was feasible and comparable 
across the 12 participating LA countries.
RESULTS: Currently, 1549 participants have been screened, and 815 randomized. 
Participants are ethnically diverse (56% are Nestizo) and have high 
cardiovascular risk (39% have metabolic syndrome).
DISCUSSION: LatAm-FINGERS overcame a significant challenge to combine the 
region's diversity into a multi-domain risk reduction intervention feasible 
across LA while preserving the original FINGER design.

BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interchangeability 
guidelines state that the primary endpoint in a switching study should assess 
the impact of switching between the proposed interchangeable product and the 
reference product on clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (if 
available), as these assessments are generally sensitive to changes in 
immunogenicity and/or exposure that may arise due to switching. In addition, 
interchangeability designation requires no clinically meaningful difference in 
safety and efficacy of switching between the biosimilar and reference, compared 
with when using the reference product alone.
OBJECTIVES:  The aim of this study was to investigate the PK, immunogenicity, 
efficacy, and safety in participants undergoing repeated switches between 
Humira® and AVT02 as part of a global interchangeable development program.
METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in 
patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis comprises three parts: lead-in 
period (weeks 1-12), switching module (weeks 12-28), and the optional extension 
phase (weeks 28-52). Following the lead-in period during which all participants 
received the reference product (80 mg in week 1, followed by 40 mg every other 
week), participants with a clinical response of ≥ 75% improvement in the 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) were randomized 1:1 to receive AVT02 
alternating with the reference product (switching arm) or reference product only 
(non-switching arm). At week 28, participants who were PASI50 responders could 
opt to take part in an open-label extension phase receiving AVT02 up to week 50, 
with an end of study visit at week 52. PK, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy 
were evaluated at various timepoints throughout the study for both switching and 
non-switching arms.
RESULTS: In total, 550 participants were randomized to switching (277) and 
non-switching arms (273). The switching versus non-switching arithmetic least 
square means ratio [90% confidence intervals (CIs)] was 101.7% (91.4-112.0%) for 
the area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval from weeks 
26-28 (AUCtau, W26-28) and 108.1% (98.3-117.9%) for maximum concentration over 
the dosing interval from weeks 26-28 (Cmax, W26-28). The 90% CIs for the 
switching versus non-switching arithmetic means ratio for primary endpoints 
AUCtau, W26-28 and Cmax, W26-28 were within the prespecified limits of 80-125%, 
demonstrating comparable PK profiles between groups. In addition, the PASI, 
Dermatology Life Quality Index, and static Physician's Global Assessment 
efficacy scores were highly similar for both treatment groups. There were no 
clinically meaningful differences between the immunogenicity and safety 
assessments of repeated switching between AVT02 and the reference product, 
versus the reference product alone.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the risk, in terms of safety or 
diminished efficacy of switching between the biosimilar and the reference 
product, is not greater than the risk of using the reference product alone, as 
required by the FDA for interchangeability designation. Beyond the scope of 
interchangeability, a consistent long-term safety and immunogenicity profile, 
with no impact on the trough levels up to 52 weeks, was established.

Quinoa is a potential crop to address the situation as it offers a plethora of 
benefits as it is nutritionally rich and can adapt to extreme climatic and salt 
conditions. Quinoa germ consists of almost 25-30% of whole grain. Quinoa germ 
obtained using roller milling has remarkable nutritional properties with high 
protein, fat and mineral content. Presence higher fat content limits shelf-life 
of quinoa germ. The objective of the present investigation is to study the 
effect of different treatment on stabilization of quinoa germ and its storge 
study. Quinoa germ was subjected to microwave and infrared treatment for 
shelf-life extension. Colour properties of the germ has not changed drastically 
by both treatments. Sorption behavior of quinoa germ stored at different RH was 
studied and results showed typical sigmoid curve for all samples. Sorption 
studies revealed that treated quinoa germ were stable at 64% RH. The storage 
study was carried out at accelerated conditions using PET/PE packaging material. 
Based on the results of the study, it can be inferred that the quinoa germ can 
be kept up to three months at accelerated conditions. Study demonstrated that 
microwave treatments of quinoa germ showed highest shelf life of three months at 
accelerated conditions.

BACKGROUND: Adequate housing is a basic human right. The many millions of people 
experiencing homelessness (PEH) have a lower life expectancy and more physical 
and mental health problems. Practical and effective interventions to provide 
appropriate housing are a public health priority.
OBJECTIVES: To summarise the best available evidence relating to the components 
of case-management interventions for PEH via a mixed methods review that 
explored both the effectiveness of interventions and factors that may influence 
its impact.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched 10 bibliographic databases from 1990 to March 2021. 
We also included studies from Campbell Collaboration Evidence and Gap Maps and 
searched 28 web sites. Reference lists of included papers and systematic reviews 
were examined and experts contacted for additional studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised and non-randomised study designs 
exploring case management interventions where a comparison group was used. The 
primary outcome of interest was homelessness. Secondary outcomes included 
health, wellbeing, employment and costs. We also included all studies where data 
were collected on views and experiences that may impact on implementation.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed risk of bias using tools developed by 
the Campbell Collaboration. We conducted meta-analyses of the intervention 
studies where possible and carried out a framework synthesis of a set of 
implementation studies identified by purposive sampling to represent the most 
'rich' and 'thick' data.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 64 intervention studies and 41 implementation studies. 
The evidence base was dominated by studies from the USA and Canada. Participants 
were largely (though not exclusively) people who were literally homeless, that 
is, living on the streets or in shelters, and who had additional support needs. 
Many studies were assessed as having a medium or high risk of bias. However, 
there was some consistency in outcomes across studies that improved confidence 
in the main findings.
CASE MANAGEMENT AND HOUSING OUTCOMES: Case management of any description was 
superior to usual care for homelessness outcomes (standardised mean difference 
[SMD] = -0.51 [95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.71, -0.30]; p < 0.01). For 
studies included in the meta-analyses, Housing First had the largest observed 
impact, followed by Assertive Community Treatment, Critical Time Intervention 
and Intensive Case Management. The only statistically significant difference was 
between Housing First and Intensive Case Management (SMD = -0.6 [-1.1, -0.1]; 
p = 0.03) at ≥12 months. There was not enough evidence to compare the above 
approaches with standard case management within the meta-analyses. A narrative 
comparison across all studies was inconclusive, though suggestive of a trend in 
favour of more intensive approaches.
CASE MANAGEMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES: The overall evidence suggested that 
case management of any description was not more or less effective compared to 
usual care for an individual's mental health (SMD = 0.02 [-0.15, 0.18]; 
p = 0.817).
CASE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER OUTCOMES: Based on meta-analyses, case management was 
superior to usual care for capability and wellbeing outcomes up to 1 year (an 
improvement of around one-third of an SMD; p < 0.01) but was not statistically 
significantly different for substance use outcomes, physical health, and 
employment.
CASE MANAGEMENT COMPONENTS: For homelessness outcomes, there was a 
non-significant trend for benefits to be greater in the medium term (≤3 years) 
compared to long term (>3 years) (SMD = -0.64 [-1.04, -0.24] vs. -0.27 [-0.53, 
0]; p = 0.16) and for in-person meetings in comparison to mixed (in-person and 
remote) approaches (SMD = -0.73 [-1.25,-0.21]) versus -0.26 [-0.5,-0.02]; 
p = 0.13). There was no evidence from meta-analyses to suggest that an 
individual case manager led to better outcomes then a team, and interventions 
with no dedicated case manager may have better outcomes than those with a named 
case manager (SMD = -0.36 [-0.55, -0.18] vs. -1.00 [-2.00, 0.00]; p = 0.02). 
There was not enough evidence from meta-analysis to assess whether the case 
manager should have a professional qualification, or if frequency of contact, 
case manager availability or conditionality (barriers due to conditions attached 
to service provision) influenced outcomes. However, the main theme from 
implementation studies concerned barriers where conditions were attached to 
services.
CHARACTERISTICS OF PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS: No conclusions could be 
drawn from meta-analysis other than a trend for greater reductions in 
homelessness for persons with high complexity of need (two or more support needs 
in addition to homelessness) as compared to those with medium complexity of need 
(one additional support need); effect sizes were SMD = -0.61 [-0.91, -0.31] 
versus -0.36 [-0.68, -0.05]; p = 0.3.
THE BROADER CONTEXT OF DELIVERY OF CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMES: Other major 
themes from the implementation studies included the importance of interagency 
partnership; provision for non-housing support and training needs of PEH (such 
as independent living skills), intensive community support following the move to 
new housing; emotional support and training needs of case managers; and an 
emphasis on housing safety, security and choice.
COST EFFECTIVENESS: The 12 studies with cost data provided contrasting results 
and no clear conclusions. Some case management costs may be largely off-set by 
reductions in the use of other services. Cost estimates from three North 
American studies were $45-52 for each additional day housed.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Case management interventions improve housing outcomes for 
PEH with one or more additional support needs, with more intense interventions 
leading to greater benefits. Those with greater support needs may gain greater 
benefit. There is also evidence for improvements to capabilities and wellbeing. 
Current approaches do not appear to lead to mental health benefits. In terms of 
case management components, there is evidence in support of a team approach and 
in-person meetings and, from the implementation evidence, that conditions 
associated with service provision should be minimised. The approach within 
Housing First could explain the finding that overall benefits may be greater 
than for other types of case management. Four of its principles were identified 
as key themes within the implementation studies: No conditionality, offer 
choice, provide an individualised approach and support community building. 
Recommendations for further research include an expansion of the research base 
outside North America and further exploration of case management components and 
intervention cost-effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION: With the increase in expected life duration, the life expectancy 
increases, and so one-third or more of a woman's life will be after the 
menopause. As a result, menopause, aging physiology and process management carry 
great importance for women's health. This study was conducted to investigate the 
effect of menopausal symptoms on women's daily life activities.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample of the descriptive and relationship-seeking 
study consisted of 381 women aged 40-64 years who agreed to participate in the 
study. The data of the study were collected by Personal Information Form, 
Menopause Symptoms Rating Scale, and Daily Living Activities Schedule. 
Descriptive statistical techniques were used to evaluate the data. Differences 
in independent groups were evaluated with Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. 
The relationship between continuous variables was evaluated with the Pearson 
correlation analysis test.
RESULTS: Of women participating in the research, 67.5% had not had a period for 
more than one year, and 95.5% entered the menopause through natural routes. The 
daily life activities most affected by the menopausal symptoms experienced by 
women were sleep, concentration, physical and mental fatigue, mental state, 
general quality of life, and enjoyment of life. The least affected daily living 
activities were sexuality and interpersonal communication. Advanced level 
significant positive correlations were found between the menopause rating scale 
and its sub-dimension scores and daily living activities scores of women (p < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that menopausal symptoms in the 
menopausal period negatively affected the daily activities of women.
