closer to the old measured VC than to the old measured FVC values, which 
introduces a substantial discrepancy between the past and present FVCs. We 
conclude that the spirometry reference values may change with time lapse. Thus, 
accuracy of prediction equations should be periodically updated, which seems to 
particularly concern the equations elaborated for the nations that undergo rapid 
economic developments connected with changes in living standards.

OBJECTIVES: Schizophrenia entails a considerable humanistic and economic burden. 
Improved treatment continuity to antipsychotic therapy is paramount to reduce 
the risk of relapse. The novel three-monthly paliperidone palmitate treatment 
(PP3M) offers the longest dosing interval currently available in France. This 
study assesses its cost-effectiveness, versus the currently available 
one-monthly long-acting treatment (PP1M) in French schizophrenic patients.
METHODS: A Markov model with monthly cycles was developed and adapted. It 
encompassed [a] administration of PP3M or PP1M in first-line, [b] a period where 
the patient does not receive any active treatment, and [c] a follow-up treatment 
line consisting of a treatment mix reflecting French clinical practice. Relapse 
rates in first-line were based on a pivotal non-inferiority head-to-head trial, 
and treatment discontinuation rates were based on French real-world data. 
Accounting for differences in drug exposure, time-dependent monthly relapse 
rates were applied following discontinuation to first line. The impact of a less 
frequent injection schedule for PP3M in QoL was accounted for through the 
application of a utility differential. The collective perspective was adopted 
throughout a 5-year time horizon. Four percent discount rates were applied on 
costs and outcomes.
RESULTS: PP3M was dominant when compared to PP1M, featuring an incremental QALY 
of 0.123 and a cost saving effect (-669€) resulting from reduced therapy costs 
(drug acquisition, administration and monitoring) and relapse-related costs. 
Sensitivity analysis supported the robustness of the results.
CONCLUSION: With slightly better QALY outcomes and a cost-saving effect when 
compared to PP1M, introducing PP3M is an improvement to the current treatment in 
France.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a major contributor to disease burden in India. To 
inform subnational action, we aimed to assess the disease burden due to 
malnutrition and the trends in its indicators in every state of India in 
relation to Indian and global nutrition targets.
METHODS: We analysed the disease burden attributable to child and maternal 
malnutrition, and the trends in the malnutrition indicators from 1990 to 2017 in 
every state of India using all accessible data from multiple sources, as part of 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017. The 
states were categorised into three groups using their Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI) calculated by GBD on the basis of per capita income, mean education, and 
fertility rate in women younger than 25 years. We projected the prevalence of 
malnutrition indicators for the states of India up to 2030 on the basis of the 
1990-2017 trends for comparison with India National Nutrition Mission (NNM) 2022 
and WHO and UNICEF 2030 targets.
FINDINGS: Malnutrition was the predominant risk factor for death in children 
younger than 5 years of age in every state of India in 2017, accounting for 
68·2% (95% UI 65·8-70·7) of the total under-5 deaths, and the leading risk 
factor for health loss for all ages, responsible for 17·3% (16·3-18·2) of the 
total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The malnutrition DALY rate was 
much higher in the low SDI than in the middle SDI and high SDI state groups. 
This rate varied 6·8 times between the states in 2017, and was highest in the 
states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, and Rajasthan. The prevalence of low 
birthweight in India in 2017 was 21·4% (20·8-21·9), child stunting 39·3% 
(38·7-40·1), child wasting 15·7% (15·6-15·9), child underweight 32·7% 
(32·3-33·1), anaemia in children 59·7% (56·2-63·8), anaemia in women 15-49 years 
of age 54·4% (53·7-55·2), exclusive breastfeeding 53·3% (51·5-54·9), and child 
overweight 11·5% (8·5-14·9). If the trends estimated up to 2017 for the 
indicators in the NNM 2022 continue in India, there would be 8·9% excess 
prevalence for low birthweight, 9·6% for stunting, 4·8% for underweight, 11·7% 
for anaemia in children, and 13·8% for anaemia in women relative to the 2022 
targets. For the additional indicators in the WHO and UNICEF 2030 targets, the 
trends up to 2017 would lead to 10·4% excess prevalence for wasting, 14·5% 
excess prevalence for overweight, and 10·7% less exclusive breastfeeding in 
2030. The prevalence of malnutrition indicators, their rates of improvement, and 
the gaps between projected prevalence and targets vary substantially between the 
states.
INTERPRETATION: Malnutrition continues to be the leading risk factor for disease 
burden in India. It is encouraging that India has set ambitious targets to 
reduce malnutrition through NNM. The trends up to 2017 indicate that 
substantially higher rates of improvement will be needed for all malnutrition 
indicators in most states to achieve the Indian 2022 and the global 2030 
targets. The state-specific findings in this report indicate the effort needed 
in each state, which will be useful in tracking and motivating further progress. 
Similar subnational analyses might be useful for other low-income and 
middle-income countries.

OBJECTIVES: To (1) explore the regional and ethnic differences in rates of 
publicly funded osteoarthritis-associated hip and knee replacement surgeries and 
(2) investigate the mortality after surgery.
DESIGN: Population-based, retrospective, cross-sectional study.
SETTING: General population in New Zealand.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with osteoarthritis who underwent publicly funded primary 
hip and knee replacement surgeries in 2005-2017. Patients aged 14-99 years were 
included.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Age-standardised rate, standardised 
mortality ratio (SMR) and 30 days, 90 days and 1 year mortality.
RESULTS: We identified 53 439 primary hip replacements and 50 072 primary knee 
replacements with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. The number and age-standardised 
rates of hip and knee replacements increased over time. Māori had the highest 
age-standardised rate of hip replacements, followed by European/others and 
Pacific, and Asian had the lowest rate. Pacific had the highest age-standardised 
rate of knee replacements, followed by Māori and European/others, and Asian had 
the lowest rate. The Northern Health Network had the lowest rate of hip 
surgeries, and the Southern Health Network had the lowest rate of knee 
surgeries. The SMRs of patients undergoing hip and knee replacements were lower 
than the general population: 0.92 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.95) for hip and 0.79 (95% CI 
0.76 to 0.82) for knee. The SMRs were decreasing over time. The patterns of 30 
days, 90 days and 1 year mortality were similar to the SMR.
CONCLUSIONS: The numbers of publicly funded osteoarthritis-associated primary 
hip and knee replacements are steadily increasing. Māori people had the highest 
age-standardised rate of hip replacements and Pacific people had the highest 
rate of knee replacements. The Northern Health Network had the lowest rate of 
hip surgeries, and the Southern Health Network had the lowest rate of knee 
surgeries. Compared with the general population, patients who had hip and knee 
replacements have a better life expectancy.

PURPOSE: There is no contemporary proof of cancer-control benefits in 
octogenarian clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa) patients with life 
expectancy (LE) < 10 years. Therefore, cancer-specific mortality (CSM) rates 
after external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) vs. no local treatment (NLT) were 
tested in octogenarian PCa patients with LE < 10 years.
METHODS: Within the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database 
(2004-2015), we identified 22,361 octogenarian clinically localized PCa patients 
who either received EBRT or NLT. Temporal trends, cumulative incidence plots and 
multivariable competing-risks regression analyses (MCR) were used after 
propensity score matching. Sensitivity analyses were performed according to 
D'Amico risk groups and LE > 5 years.
RESULTS: Of all, 7325 (32.8%) received EBRT vs. 15,036 (67.2%) received NLT. 
Rates of EBRT significantly increased over time (25.0-42.4%). Overall, 10-year 
CSM rates were 10.6% vs. 17.0% and 10-year other-cause mortality rates were 
50.3% vs. 58.1%, in EBRT vs. NLT patients (both p < 0.001). In MCR focusing on 
the overall cohort, EBRT represented an independent predictor of lower CSM 
(hazard ratio: 0.5). In sensitivity analyses, hazard ratios of 0.5 (p < 0.001), 
0.5 (p < 0.001) and 0.8 (p = 0.5) were, respectively, recorded in D'Amico high-, 
intermediate- and low-risk patients. In sensitivity analyses addressing patients 
with LE > 5 years virtually the same results were recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: In octogenarian patients with LE < 10 years, EBRT seems to be 
associated with lower CSM in D'Amico high-risk, as well as in D'Amico 
intermediate-risk patients relative to their NLT counterparts. Based on these 
observations, greater consideration for EBRT may be given in octogenarian 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates survival of patients with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) after major lower extremity amputation (MLEA), given the burden 
of peripheral arterial disease in patients with ESRD, the hindrance posed by 
cardiovascular disease on their survival, and the national investment in 
ESRD-related care.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all hemodialysis patients (HD) and renal 
transplant (RT) recipients who underwent MLEA between January 2007 and December 
2011 in the United States Renal Data System was performed. Univariable, 
Kaplan-Meier, multivariable logistic, and Cox regression analyses were used to 
evaluate patient survival among HD patients and RT recipients overall; and 
within strata of amputation level, gender, and race.
RESULTS: There were 32,540 MLEAs (HD, 92%; RT, 8%). Among HD patients, the 
median survival was 6 months for above knee amputation (AKA) and 16 months for 
below knee amputation (BKA). The risk-adjusted mortality was higher for AKA 
compared with BKA (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.44-1.52; P < .001), females compared with males (aHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 
1.01-1.08; P = .004), but lower for blacks (aHR, 0.78 95% CI, 0.76-0.81; P < 
.001) and Hispanics (aHR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.70-0.79; P < .001) compared with white 
HD patients. Among RT recipients, the median survival was 16 months for AKA and 
47 months for BKA. Mortality was significantly higher for above knee amputees 
compared with below knee amputees (aHR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.60-2.10; P < .001). 
However, there was no difference in mortality between the gender and racial 
categories of RT recipients. There was a twofold increase in the 30-day 
mortality (adjusted odd ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.66-2.25; P < .001) and long-term 
mortality (aHR, 2.18; 95% CI, 2.05-2.32; P < .001) for HD patients relative to 
RT recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival after MLEA is limited in patients with ESRD. It is 
relatively better for RT recipients compared with HD patients. Mortality was 
higher for females compared with males, but lower for blacks and Hispanics 
compared with white HD patients. There were no gender- or race-specific 
difference in mortality among RT recipients. These estimates of life expectancy 
should guide the informed decision- making process for patients and their 
healthcare providers when the need for intervention arises after MLEA in these 
unique categories of patients.

Since the first public demonstration of anaesthesia in Boston, USA which 
happened around 172 years back, the field of anesthesiology has rapidly 
progressed, with many developments that have improved the quality and safety of 
anesthesia care. This has enabled tremendous advances in the surgical 
disciplines and increasing the life expectancy and quality of life of humans. 
This is a result of learning and constantly evolving. There are several 
similarities between healthcare and other industries, though there are several 
distinguishing characteristics that set it apart from other industries. There 
are a number of safety and quality improvement measures in healthcare which have 
been influenced by safety practices in other industries. Anaesthesia has been 
the leader among the medical specialities in adoption of innovative practices 
from various industries in an effort to advance patient safety, enhance quality 
of care, reduce waste & inefficiency, and improve customer service and 
satisfaction. This article emphasises on learnings from other industries in the 
recent decades, focusing on aviation, high-reliability organizations, car 
manufacturing, telecommunication, car racing, entertainment, and retail. 
Learning and implanting the best practices from these industries can bring about 
a paradigm shift in health care industry. It has a potential to improve 
efficiency and make anaesthesia safer than ever before in the history of human 
kind.

AIM: To develop a model to evaluate the cost-utility of choroidal nevi 
monitoring recommendations with varying clinical risk factors.
METHODS: A Markov model was created to evaluate the cost-utility in cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year ($/QALY) for monitoring patients with choroidal 
nevus. This probabilistic model was applied both to a hypothetically monitored 
and unmonitored group of patients beginning at different ages and with varying 
clinical risk factors of the nevus. Duration of screening was modeled for the 
remainder of the patients' life expectancy. Best available clinical data on the 
prevalence and incidence of choroidal nevi/melanoma, and relative risk of nevus 
transformation were combined with the initial and downstream costs of screening, 
downstream costs of melanoma-related mortality, and QALY saved by monitoring, to 
estimate the best monitoring regimen. Main outcome measures were average $/QALY 
saved by consensus recommended monitoring scenarios for the duration of a 
patient's remaining life expectancy in comparison with no follow-up, and the 
cost-utility of modified regimens.
RESULTS: The $/QALY of the recommended monitoring scenarios varied substantially 
based on nevus clinical risk factors, patient age, frequency of follow-up, and 
objective testing utilized. The $/QALY for the recommended monitoring scenario 
of a flat nevus without risk factors in a 60-year-old patient was $77 180. The 
$/QALY for monitoring a nevus with 3 clinical risk factors in a 60-year-old 
patient was $85 393. The $/QALY values for differently-aged patients were 
larger, and intermediate degrees of risk factors for nevus growth varied, 
depending largely upon the specifics of the modeled monitoring scenarios.
CONCLUSION: The average $/QALY of currently recommended monitoring scenarios 
fall within economically acceptable standards and could provide insight for 
formulating appropriate clinical strategies. Cost-utility could be enhanced by 
targeting higher risk groups and considering less frequent monitoring for the 
lower risk groups.

INTRODUCTION: Compromised joint range of motion (ROM) can negatively affect the 
capacity to perform activities of daily living in clinical populations. 
Recently, similar improvements in dorsiflexion ROM were reported following 
dynamometry-based contract-relax (CR) stretching and modified CR stretching 
technique (stretch-return-contract [SRC]) where the contraction phase was 
performed "off stretch." As neither the impact of SRC on other muscle groups nor 
the ecological validity of SRC performed in an applied environment has been 
tested, the acute effects of both techniques in dynamometry- (CRdyna and SRCdyna 
) and field-based (CRfield and SRCfield ) environments were compared with the 
hamstring muscle group.
METHODS: Seventeen participants performed each of the four stretching conditions 
on separate days in a randomized order. Before and after the stretches, knee 
extension ROM and passive knee flexor moment were recorded on an isokinetic 
dynamometer.
RESULTS: Significant (P < .01) increases in knee extension ROM (4.6-5.2°) and 
elastic potential energy storage (12.0%-23.6%) and decreases in the slope of the 
passive moment-angle relation (8.9%-12.2%) occurred in all conditions. 
Significant increases in peak passive joint moment were observed after field- 
(14.3%-14.8%) but not dynamometry-based (4.6%-6.6%) stretches. No difference 
(P > .05) in any measure was found between conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the acute efficacy of the SRC technique in the 
hamstring muscle group and demonstrate its ecological validity in an applied 
environment in healthy participants. As the field-based SRC technique was 
performed without partner assistance, when compared with classical PNF it 
represents an equally effective and practical stretching paradigm to support 
athletic and clinical exercise prescription.

schistosomiasis japonica.
METHODS: The patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica receiving treatment 
and assistance programs in Hunan Province in 2017 were enrolled, and the years 
lived with disability (YLD) for the patients with advanced schistosomiasis 
japonica was calculated using the common global burden of disease (GBD) 
estimation method, the modified GBD method with addition of common syndromes of 
advanced schistosomiasis japonica, and the quality of life assessment method.
RESULTS: The YLDs of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica, the mean 
YLDs per capita, and the percentages of YLD were 673.94, 728.77 person-years and 
1 761.99 person-years; 0.181, 0.196 person-years and 0.474 person-years; and 
10.61, 11.48 person-years per 100 thousand persons and 27.75 person-years per 
100 thousand persons with the common GBD method, modified GBD method and the 
quality of life method, respectively. The YLDs of the patients with advanced 
schistosomiasis japonica in Hunan Province estimated with the modified GBD 
method and the quality of life method were 8.14% and 2.61 times higher than that 
with the common GBD method. Of the major symptoms included in the calculation, 
the 5 symptoms with the greatest contribution to the burden of advanced 
schistosomiasis japonica included ascites, moderate anemia, severe anemia, 
diarrhea and hematochezia.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality of life method may more comprehensively assess the YLDs 
in patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica than the common and modified 
GBD methods.

Faba beans have a short shelf life which is even reduced after fresh-cut 
processing mainly due to browning and dehydration. In that sense, the effects of 
a UV-C treatment (3 kJ m-2), compared with non-exposed beans (CTRL), were 
studied on the sensory and microbial quality, and bioactive and anti-nutritional 
content of fresh-cut faba beans (cv. Muchamiel) during storage at 5 ℃. The 
effect of a domestic microwaving (3 min, 900 W) on bioactive and 
anti-nutritional compounds of fresh seeds prior to consumption at each sampling 
time was also studied. UV-C treatment extended the fresh-cut faba bean shelf 
life from 7 to 10 days with browning score (the main sensory parameter adversely 
affected) of 8 and 1 log unit lower than CTRL at day 10. UV-C did not negatively 
affect the total antioxidant capacity of samples during storage. The phytic acid 
and raffinose contents decreased by 30/40%, respectively, after 10 days, without 
influence of the UV-C treatment. Microwaving reduced the phytic acid and 
condensed tannins contents by 30% in those samples stored for up to six days, 
with low microwaving effect in the last storage days. Nevertheless, UV-C 
improved the condensed tannins reductions through storage (≈30%) compared with 
non-irradiated samples.

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved the life expectancy of 
HIV patients, thus increasing the number of people living with HIV (PLWH). 
However, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are now one of the most prevalent causes 
of death among PLWH. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are the 
backbone of cART, and the emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
(TDF) coformulation is commonly used. In prior studies, acute NRTI 
treatment-induced endothelial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species 
production, and mitophagic activity, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction 
may be critical to NRTI-induced endothelial dysfunction. Mitochondrial 
dysfunction plays a causal role in endothelial senescence, whereas premature 
endothelial senescence can promote the development of CVD. We hypothesize that 
for chronic NRTI treatment, a disruption in mitochondrial homeostasis leads to 
premature endothelial senescence and predisposes PLWH to CVD. We used human 
aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and HIV-1 transgenic (Tg26) mice to test the 
interrelationship between mitochondrial and vascular dysfunction after chronic 
NRTI treatment in vitro and in vivo. Mitochondrial DNA copy number was decreased 
in late-passage HAEC treated with NRTIs, and senescence-associated 
β-galactosidase accumulation was elevated. In late-passage HAEC, NRTIs decreased 
the activity of Parkin-mediated mitophagy. In Tg26 mice treated with FTC, plasma 
nitrite levels were decreased. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 
NRTI-treated Tg26 mice was also reduced. Our work suggests that long-term use of 
NRTI may disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis, induce premature endothelial 
senescence, and impair vascular function.

BACKGROUND: Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased life expectancy 
for HIV patients to levels close to that observed for general population. 
Comorbidities are also increasing, due to ageing of such population. Erectile 
dysfunction (ED) has been a frequent finding in men living with HIV.
OBJECTIVES: The goals of the present study were to define the prevalence of ED 
and associated factors in HIV-infected men, in a referral center of Salvador 
city, Brazil.
METHODS: HIV-infected men ≥18 years of age, receiving care at the AIDS Clinics 
of Complexo Hospitalar Professor Edgard Santos (C-HUPES), Universidade Federal 
da Bahia were consecutively included in the study until the estimated sample 
size (N=134) was reached. Patients filled a structured questionnaire on 
clinical-epidemiological characteristics, as well as the International Index on 
Erectile Function to assess ED.
RESULTS: Most (55%) were black and single (79%), mean age 44.8 years. ED was 
detected in 29 (21.6%) patients; 86% of ED cases were classified as severe. The 
only factors associated with ED were low income (p=0.02) and unemployment 
(p=0.01). No association was found between ED and frequency of comorbidities, 
age, or ART used by patients.
CONCLUSION: In a referral center in Salvador city, socio-economic problems were 
the main factors associated with ED. Psychological impact of poor social 
conditions should be routinely assessed in patients with ED to implement 
preventive measures for ED.

BACKGROUND:  In elderly patients, complex soft tissue defects are increasingly 
observed due to the prolonged life expectancy and accompanying comorbidities. 
The aim of this study is to evaluate whether free tissue transfer is safe in 
very old patients without additional risk and complications.
METHODS:  All patients older than 65 years undergoing free tissue transfer 
between November 2007 and September 2016 were reviewed in a retrospective study. 
Two cohorts were compared regarding perioperative morbidity and postoperative 
outcome (cohort 1 [old patients, ages 65-79]; cohort 2 [very old patients, 
ages ≥ 80]).
RESULTS:  In total, 256 patients were included in the study (cohort 1 [n = 217]; 
cohort 2 [n = 39]). Overall, 262 free flaps were performed due to a second 
microsurgical reconstruction in six cases. No statistically significant 
differences between cohorts were observed regarding surgical complications, 
total flap losses, and mortality. Detailed evaluation of cohort 2 revealed a 
significant learning curve during the observation period regarding the 
perioperative management and procedure of soft tissue reconstruction: operation 
length as well as postoperative intensive care unit stay decreased significantly 
over time (p < 0.05) and also surgical complications showed a positive trend 
(p = 0.07). We ascertained a shift toward a "more reliable" flap selection from 
predominantly anterolateral thigh flap) to axial flaps such as rectus abdominis 
and latissimus dorsi flaps.
CONCLUSION:  Our study showed that age is not associated with an increased risk 
of postoperative complications. Reliable muscle free flaps, two-stage 
procedures, and safe vascular supply are important strategic aspects to achieve 
microvascular tissue transfer with high success rates in geriatric patients.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, ranging from 0.1% in 
patients <55 years to >9% in octogenarian patients. One important issue is 
represented by the 5-fold increased ischemic stroke risk in AF patients. Hence, 
the role of anticoagulation is central. Until a few years ago, vitamin K 
antagonists (VKAs) and low molecular weight heparin represented the only option 
to prevent thromboembolisms, though with risks. Novel oral anticoagulants 
(NOACs) have radically changed the management of AF patients, improving both 
life expectancy and life quality. This review aims to summarize the most recent 
literature on the use of VKAs and NOACs in AF, in light of the new findings.

The World Health Organization (WHO) strives to assist and inspire cities to 
become more "age-friendly", and the fundamentals are included in the Global 
Age-Friendly Cities Guide. An age-friendly city enables residents to grow older 
actively within their families, neighbourhoods and civil society, and offers 
extensive opportunities for the participation of older people in the community. 
Over the decades, technology has become essential for contemporary and future 
societies, and even more imperative as the decades move on, given we are nearly 
in our third decade of the twenty-first century. Yet, technology is not 
explicitly considered in the 8-domain model by the WHO, which describes an 
age-friendly city. This paper discusses the gaps in the WHO's age-friendly 
cities model in the field of technology and provides insights and 
recommendations for expansion of the model for application in the context of 
countries with a high human development index that wish to be fully 
age-friendly. This work is distinctive because of the proposed new age-friendly 
framework, and the work presented in this paper contributes to the fields of 
gerontology, geography urban and development, computer science, and 
gerontechnology.

Cold spells and heat waves in a changing climate are well known as great 
public-health concerns due to their adverse effects on human health. However, 
very few studies have quantified health impacts of heat and cold in the region 
of Northwestern China. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the 
effects of cold and heat on years of life lost (YLL) in Lanzhou, a city with 
temperate continental climate. We compiled a daily dataset including deaths, 
weather variables, and air pollutants in Lanzhou, China, from 2014-2017. We used 
a distributed lag non-linear model to estimate single-day and cumulative effects 
of heat and cold on daily YLL. Results indicated that both cold and heat were 
associated with increased YLL for registered residents in Lanzhou. Estimated 
heat effects appeared immediately in the first two days, while estimated cold 
effects lasted over a longer period (up to 30 days). Cold significantly 
increased the YLL of all residents except for males and those with respiratory 
diseases (≥65 years). Our results showed that both heat and cold had more 
pronounced effects on cardiovascular diseases compared to respiratory diseases. 
Males might be more vulnerable to heat, while females might suffer more YLL from 
cold. The effects of cold or heat on the elderly might appear earlier and last 
longer than those for other age groups.

Research on healthy aging shows that lifespan reductions are often caused by 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, it is very interesting that the deletion of 
mitochondrial matrix peptidase LonP1 was observed to abolish embryogenesis, 
while deletion of the mitochondrial matrix peptidase Caseinolytic Mitochondrial 
Matrix Peptidase Proteolytic Subunit (ClpP) prolonged survival. To unveil the 
targets of each enzyme, we documented the global proteome of LonP1+/- mouse 
embryonal fibroblasts (MEF), for comparison with ClpP-/- depletion. Proteomic 
profiles of LonP1+/- MEF generated by label-free mass spectrometry were further 
processed with the STRING (Search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes) 
webserver Heidelberg for protein interactions. ClpP was previously reported to 
degrade Eral1 as a chaperone involved in mitoribosome assembly, so ClpP 
deficiency triggers the accumulation of mitoribosomal subunits and inefficient 
translation. LonP1+/- MEF also showed Eral1 accumulation, but no systematic 
effect on mitoribosomal subunits. In contrast to ClpP-/- profiles, several 
components of the respiratory complex-I membrane arm, of the glutathione pathway 
and of lysosomes were accumulated, whereas the upregulation of numerous innate 
immune defense components was similar. Overall, LonP1, as opposed to ClpP, 
appears to have no effect on translational machinery, instead it shows enhanced 
respiratory dysfunction; this agrees with reports on the human CODAS syndrome 
(syndrome with cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular, and skeletal anomalies) 
caused by LonP1 mutations.

Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) constitutes a chronic progressive 
demyelinating disease which negatively affects the central nervous system. MS 
symptoms detrimentally affect the quality of life, as well as the life 
expectancy of MS patients. In this aspect, the present study aims to critically 
summarize and evaluate the currently available clinical studies focusing on the 
potential beneficial effects of dietary supplements on controlling MS 
symptomatology and relapse. Methods: PubMed database was comprehensively 
searched, using relative keywords to identify clinical trials that investigated 
the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation against MS symptomatology and 
progression. 40 clinical trials were found, which were divided into categories. 
Results: Nutritional status of MS patients, as well as supplementation have been 
suggested as potential factors affecting progression. Several substantial 
studies have documented a systematically high prevalence of vitamin A, B12 and 
D3 deficiency amongst MS patients. At present, clinical data have suggested that 
most of the dietary supplements under study may exert antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties, improving depression symptomatology and quality of 
life overall. However, malnutrition risk in MS patients has not been adequately 
explored in order for more precise conclusions to be drawn. The supplements that 
may have a positive effect on MS are vitamins, fatty acids, antioxidants, 
phytochemicals and melatonin. Conclusions: Several dietary supplements may 
decrease inflammation and fatigue, also increasing also autoimmunity tolerance 
in MS patients, and thus improving quality of life and life expectancy. 
Currently, there is no effective clinical indication for applying dietary 
supplementation as complementary treatment against MS symptomatology.

Fruit and vegetables are an important part of human diets and provide multiple 
health benefits. However, due to the short shelf-life of fresh and 
minimally-processed fruit and vegetables, significant losses occur throughout 
the food distribution chain. Shelf-life extension requires preserving both the 
quality and safety of food products. The quality of fruit and vegetables, either 
fresh or fresh-cut, depends on many factors and can be determined by analytical 
or sensory evaluation methods. Among the various technologies used to maintain 
the quality and increase shelf-life of fresh and minimally-processed fruit and 
vegetables, biological control is a promising approach. Biological control 
refers to postharvest control of pathogens using microbial cultures. With 
respect to application of biological control for increasing the shelf-life of 
food, the term biopreservation is favored, although the approach is identical. 
The methods for screening and development of biocontrol agents differ greatly
