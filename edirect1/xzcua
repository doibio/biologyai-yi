BACKGROUND: Cost effectiveness analyses (CEAs) are widely used to evaluate the 
opportunity cost of health care investments. However, few functions that take 
equity concerns into account are available for such CEA methods, and these 
concerns are therefore at risk of being disregarded. Among the functions that 
have been developed, most focus on the distribution of health gains, as opposed 
to the distribution of lifetime health. This is despite the fact that there are 
good reasons to give higher priority to individuals and groups with a low 
quality adjusted life expectancy from birth (QALE). Also, an even distribution 
of health gains may imply an uneven distribution of lifetime health.
METHODS: We develop a systematic and explicit approach that allows for the 
inclusion of lifetime health concerns in CEAs, by creating a new priority weight 
function, PW = α+(t-γ)·C·e-β·(t-γ), where t is the health measure. PW has 
several desirable properties. First, it is continuous and smooth, ensuring that 
people with similar health characteristics are treated alike. For example, those 
who achieve 50 QALE should be treated similarly to those who achieve 49.9 QALE. 
Second, it is flexible regarding shape and outcome measure (i.e., caters to 
other measures than QALE), so that a broad range of values may be modelled. 
Third, the coefficients have distinct roles. This allows for the easy 
manipulation of the PW's shape. In order to demonstrate how PW may be applied, 
we use data from a previous study and estimated the coefficients of PW based on 
two approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Equity concerns are important when conducting CEAs, which means 
that suitable PWs should be developed. We do not intend to determine which PW is 
the most appropriate, but to illustrate how a flexible general PW can be 
estimated based on empirical data.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder most common among 
African American and Hispanic American persons. The disease can cause 
substantial, long-term, and costly health problems, including infections, 
stroke, and kidney failure, many of which can reduce life expectancy. 
Disparities in receiving health care among African Americans and other 
racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States are well known and directly 
related to poor outcomes associated with SCD. As an orphan disease-one that 
affects <200 000 persons nationwide-SCD does not receive the research funding 
and pharmaceutical investment directed to other orphan diseases. For example, 
cystic fibrosis affects fewer than half the number of persons but receives 3.5 
times the funding from the National Institutes of Health and 440 times the 
funding from national foundations. In this review, we discuss the health 
inequities affecting persons with SCD, describe programs intended to improve 
their care, and identify actions that could be taken to further reduce these 
inequities, improve care, control treatment costs, and ease the burden of 
disease.

OBJECTIVES: Racial differences in mortality in the United States have narrowed 
and vary by time and place. The objectives of our study were to (1) examine the 
gap in life expectancy between white and black persons (hereinafter, racial gap 
in life expectancy) in 4 states (California, Georgia, Illinois, and New York) 
and (2) estimate trends in the contribution of major causes of death (CODs) to 
the racial gap in life expectancy by age group.
METHODS: We extracted data on the number of deaths and population sizes for 
1969-2013 by state, sex, race, age group, and 6 major CODs. We used a Bayesian 
time-series model to smooth and impute mortality rates and decomposition methods 
to estimate trends in sex- and age-specific contributions of CODs to the racial 
gap in life expectancy.
RESULTS: The racial gap in life expectancy at birth decreased in all 4 states, 
especially among men in New York (from 8.8 to 1.1 years) and women in Georgia 
(from 8.0 to 1.7 years). Although few deaths occurred among persons aged 1-39, 
racial differences in mortality at these ages (mostly from injuries and infant 
mortality) contributed to the racial gap in life expectancy, especially among 
men in California (1.0 year of the 4.3-year difference in 2013) and Illinois 
(1.9 years of the 6.7-year difference in 2013). Cardiovascular deaths 
contributed most to the racial gap in life expectancy for adults aged 40-64, but 
contributions decreased among women aged 40-64, especially in Georgia (from 2.8 
to 0.5 years). The contribution of cancer deaths to inequality increased in 
California and Illinois, whereas New York had the greatest reductions in 
inequality attributable to cancer deaths (from 0.6 to 0.2 years among men and 
from 0.2 to 0 years among women).
CONCLUSIONS: Future research should identify policy innovations and economic 
changes at the state level to better understand New York's success, which may 
help other states emulate its performance.

In Australia, and other parts of the world, tower infrastructure in electricity 
transmission networks are nearing the end of their asset life. In changing 
economic, political and regulatory environments Transmission Network Service 
Providers are implementing new approaches to asset management and reinvestment, 
such as refurbishment to extend the life of existing assets, instead of 
replacement. As part of these refurbishment efforts, abrasive blasting and 
recoating is being employed to remove corrosion and extend the life of steel 
electricity transmission towers. New controls and procedures have been developed 
to manage the most likely impacts associated with the abrasive blasting of 
transmission towers. However, little or no data have been available on the 
environmental impacts of abrasive blasting or the effectiveness of management 
procedures currently being used to mitigate potential adverse environmental 
impacts.We conducted an integrated study on the impacts of abrasive blasting, 
which brought together on-site research; modelling; and controlled laboratory 
trials. The study was undertaken during a transmission tower refurbishment 
project within the World Heritage listed Wet Tropics Region in Queensland, 
Australia. Measured metal deposition around towers due to blasting, was 
primarily as large particles (>PM10) at 12-30 m from the tower. Soil 
concentrations of metals were highest under towers, with a small number of 
samples showing elevated zinc at 12-30 m. The presence of spent abrasive media 
and dust on the geofabric material used under the towers and up to 15 m from the 
tower base, as part of control measures used to contain the abrasive products, 
indicates that deposition also occurs between 0 and 12 m from the tower.The 
potential impacts of the abrasive blasting technique on plants and invertebrates 
appear to be low. Five species of tropical rainforest tree seedlings exposed to 
abrasive blasting dust at worst-case levels had no negative impact on 
physiological performance or plant health. This research will assist 
Transmission Network Service Providers and other operators of corroded linear 
infrastructure to plan and implement mitigating management actions and 
procedures during abrasive blasting projects and assist regulators and the 
community to better understand the impacts of the practice.

The translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) is the main entry gate 
for proteins1-4. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to report the structure of 
the yeast TOM core complex5-9 at 3.8-Å resolution. The structure reveals the 
high-resolution architecture of the translocator consisting of two Tom40 
β-barrel channels and α-helical transmembrane subunits, providing insight into 
critical features that are conserved in all eukaryotes1-3. Each Tom40 β-barrel 
is surrounded by small TOM subunits, and tethered by two Tom22 subunits and one 
phospholipid. The N-terminal extension of Tom40 forms a helix inside the 
channel; mutational analysis reveals its dual role in early and late steps in 
the biogenesis of intermembrane-space proteins in cooperation with Tom5. Each 
Tom40 channel possesses two precursor exit sites. Tom22, Tom40 and Tom7 guide 
presequence-containing preproteins to the exit in the middle of the dimer, 
whereas Tom5 and the Tom40 N extension guide preproteins lacking a presequence 
to the exit at the periphery of the dimer.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is a rare inherited connective tissue 
disorder due to heterozygous pathogenic COL3A1 variants. Arterial, intestinal, 
and/or uterine fragility is the disease hallmark and results in reduced life 
expectancy. The clinical diagnosis is not always straightforward and patients' 
selection for molecular confirmation depends on the characteristics of applied 
criteria, that is, the Villefranche criteria (in use until 2017) and their 
revision according to the new EDS nosology. Herein, we reassessed the clinical 
features of 50 molecularly proven vEDS patients, diagnosed according to the 
Villefranche nosology between 2000 and 2016, using the 2017 classification in 
order to explore its clinical application. Our findings indicate that the 
Villefranche criteria were particularly valuable for symptomatic patients, even 
if with a limited specificity. Our study also suggests that the revised vEDS 
criteria, although expected to be more specific, might have a poorer accuracy, 
principally in terms of sensitivity. Both sets of criteria are less effective in 
presymptomatic young patients, especially in the absence of a clear-cut family 
history. For these patients, the careful evaluation of the cutaneous, articular, 
and dysmorphic features and, above all, genetic testing remain crucial to set-up 
proper follow-up and surveillance before catastrophic vascular and intestinal 
events.

microRNAs (miRNAs) have been established as critical regulators of the 
pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (DM), and diabetes microvascular complications 
(DMCs). However, manually curated databases for miRNAs, and DM (including DMCs) 
association studies, have yet to be established. Here, we constructed a 
user-friendly database, "miR2Diabetes," equipped with a graphical web interface 
for simple browsing or searching manually curated annotations. The annotations 
in our database cover 14 DM and DMC phenotypes, involving 156 miRNAs, by 
browsing diverse sample origins (e.g., blood, kidney, liver, and other tissues). 
Additionally, we provide miRNA annotations for disease-model organisms 
(including rats and mice), of DM and DMCs, for the purpose of improving 
knowledge of the biological complexity of these pathologies. We assert that our 
database will be a comprehensive resource for miRNA biomarker studies, as well 
as for prioritizing miRNAs for functional validation, in DM and DMCs, with 
likely extension to other diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the disease burden of diet-related chronic diseases in 
China between 1990 and 2016.
METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Disease 2016, we extracted the absolute 
number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years( DALYs) of diet-related 
chronic diseases and the corresponding age-standardized rates in China in 1990 
and 2016. Subgroup analyses were conducted in various gender, dietary risk 
factors and categories of diseases.
RESULTS: In 2016, the total number and rate of diet-related NCDs deaths was 2493 
thousand and 182. 4/100000. The corresponding number and rate of DALYs was 54995 
thousand person-year and 4023. 0/100000. Compared with those in 1990, the rates 
of death and DALYs in 2016 increased by19. 5% and 9. 3%, respectively. Both 
death rate and DALYs rate increased with the age. Death rate( 214. 6/100000) and 
DALYs rate( 4961. 1/100000) in males were 1. 4-fold and 1. 6-fold as that in 
females( 148. 2/100000 and 3028. 2/100000, respectively). High intake in sodium, 
low intake in whole grains and low intake in fruits were the three leading 
dietary risk factors and cardiovascular diseases accounted for 88. 1% DALYs in 
all chronic diseases.
CONCLUSION: The burden of diet-related chronic diseases in China is severe and 
it continues increasing over years.

Improvements in life expectancy among people living with human immunodeficiency 
virus (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral treatment in the United States and Canada 
might differ among key populations. Given the difference in substance use among 
key populations and the current opioid epidemic, drug- and alcohol-related 
deaths might be contributing to the disparities in life expectancy. We sought to 
estimate life expectancy at age 20 years in key populations (and their 
comparison groups) in 3 time periods (2004-2007, 2008-2011, and 2012-2015) and 
the potential increase in expected life expectancy with a simulated 20% 
reduction in drug- and alcohol-related deaths using the novel Lives Saved 
Simulation model. Among 92,289 PLWH, life expectancy increased in all key 
populations and comparison groups from 2004-2007 to 2012-2015. Disparities in 
survival of approximately a decade persisted among black versus white men who 
have sex with men and people with (vs. without) a history of injection drug use. 
A 20% reduction in drug- and alcohol-related mortality would have the greatest 
life-expectancy benefit for black men who have sex with men, white women, and 
people with a history of injection drug use. Our findings suggest that 
preventing drug- and alcohol-related deaths among PLWH could narrow disparities 
in life expectancy among some key populations, but other causes of death must be 
addressed to further narrow the disparities.

BACKGROUND: Whether and to what extent leisure-time physical activity at the 
recommended levels of 150-min moderate activity is associated with survival in 
people with cardiometabolic multimorbidity and depression is unknown.
METHODS: UK Biobank participants were classified into groups: (i) no disease; 
(ii) diabetes; (iii) cardiovascular disease (CVD); (iv) depression; (v) diabetes 
and CVD; (vi) diabetes and depression; (vii) CVD and depression; (viii) 
diabetes, CVD and depression. Leisure-time physical activity was categorized as 
active (meeting recommendations) or inactive. Survival models were applied to 
estimate life expectancy.
RESULTS: A total of 480 940 participants were included (median age, 58 years; 
46% men; 95% white), of whom 74% with cardiometabolic multimorbidity and 
depression were inactive. During a mean follow-up of 7 years, 11 006 deaths 
occurred. At age of 45 years, being physically active was associated with 2.34 
(95% confidence interval: 0.93, 3.54) additional years of life compared with 
being inactive in participants with diabetes; corresponding estimates were 2.28 
(1.40, 3.16) for CVD; 2.15 (0.05, 4.26) for diabetes and CVD; and 1.58 (1.27, 
1.89) for no disease. Participants with a combination of diabetes, CVD and 
depression, being active was associated with 6.81 (-1.50, 15.31) additional 
years compared with being inactive; corresponding estimates were 3.07 (-2.46, 
8.59) for diabetes and depression; 2.34 (-1.24, 5.91) for CVD and depression; 
and 0.80 (-0.46, 2.05) for depression. A similar pattern was found at 65 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Meeting the recommended level of physical activity was associated 
with a longer life expectancy in people with cardiometabolic multimorbidity but 
not in those with depression.

Clinical predictors of complications in patients with left-sided infective 
endocarditis: A retrospective study of 206 episodes.

Pazdernik M, Wohlfahrt P, Kautzner J, Kettner J, Sochman J, Stasek J, Solar M, 
Pelouch R, Vojacek J.

PURPOSE: Early identification of specific patient subgroups at high risk of 
developing life-threatening infective endocarditis (IE) complications is of 
paramount importance. Better stratification may allow more intensive treatment 
of these patients and positively influences clinical outcomes.
METHODS: We carried out a retrospective survey of consecutive left-sided IE 
adult patients, admitted over a 15-year period to two main tertiary care centres 
in the Czech Republic.
RESULTS: Among a group of 196 patients (155 males; median age 64 years), a total 
of 206 left-sided IE episodes were identified. Perivalvular extension of 
infection was most frequently seen in prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis (OR 
6.706, p<0.0001). Valve prolapse/perforation during IE episodes was 
significantly associated with mitral valve IE (OR 2.136, p=0.026) and vegetation 
length (OR 1.055, p=0.009). Septic shock was significantly related to two main 
risk factors: S. aureus infection (OR 8.459, p=<0.0001) and smoking (OR 8.403, 
p=0.001). Mitral valve IE with a vegetation length ≥13 mm was the strongest risk 
factor for this complication (OR 3.24, p=0.001), followed by S. aureus infection 
(OR 3.59, p=0.002). Finally, septic shock (OR 6.000, p=0.001) represented the 
most important risk factor of in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the most detailed profile of complication 
predictors related to left-sided IE in Central Europe. Early individual 
stratification of IE related occurrence of complications might help to decrease 
extremely high morbidity and mortality of this disease (Tab. 5, Ref. 37).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze trends in alcohol 
consumption and mortality and their association with alcohol control measures in 
Russia between 1990 and 2017.
METHOD: Analysis of trends for all-cause mortality and alcohol-related 
mortality, life expectancy, and total adult per capita alcohol consumption and 
their relationship were conducted. A narrative literature review of alcohol 
control policies since 1990 was done.
RESULTS: Corresponding trends of alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality and 
cause-specific mortality were observed for the analyzed period. Steep increases 
in consumption and mortality occurred in 1991-1994 and in 1998-2002, and a 
continuous decline was observed since 2003. Trends in alcohol consumption were 
also closely mirrored by trends in life expectancy. These dynamics seem to be 
affected by economic trends and alcohol control policies, which were 
increasingly implemented over the observation period, even though some measures 
remained vague.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of several factors seems to be at play to explain 
alcohol consumption and mortality trends: the general economic situation, the 
availability and affordability of alcohol, and the changing patterns of alcohol 
consumption. Alcohol control measures seem to have had a positive impact on 
decreasing alcohol consumption and mortality insofar as they have reinforced the 
existing economic trends.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery are exposed to a 
high risk of death. A quality improvement (QI) programme to improve the survival 
for these patients was evaluated in the Enhanced Peri-Operative Care for 
High-risk patients (EPOCH) trial. This study aims to assess its 
cost-effectiveness versus usual care from a UK health service perspective.
METHODS: Data collected in a subsample of trial participants were employed to 
estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the QI programme and 
usual care within the 180-day trial period, with results also extrapolated to 
estimate lifetime costs and QALYs. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The probability of being 
cost-effective was determined for different cost-effectiveness thresholds 
(£13,000 to £30,000 per QALY). Analyses were performed for lower-risk and 
higher-risk subgroups based on the number of surgical indications (single vs 
multiple).
RESULTS: Within the trial period, QI was more costly (£467) but less effective 
(-0.002 QALYs). Over a lifetime, it was more costly (£1395) and more effective 
(0.018 QALYs), but did not appear to be cost-effective (ICER: £77,792 per QALY, 
higher than all cost-effectiveness thresholds; probability of being 
cost-effective: 28.7%-43.8% across the thresholds). For lower-risk patients, QI 
was more costly and less effective both within trial period and over a lifetime 
and it did not appear to be cost-effective. For higher-risk patients, it was 
more costly and more effective, and did not appear cost-effective within the 
trial period (ICER: £158,253 per QALY) but may be cost-effective over a lifetime 
(ICER: £14,293 per QALY).
CONCLUSION: The QI programme does not appear cost-effective at standard 
cost-effectiveness thresholds. For patients with multiple surgical indications, 
this programme is potentially cost-effective over a lifetime, but this is highly 
uncertain.

BACKGROUND: Our study seeks to find a cost-saving screening strategy in a 
primary care population for diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism based on peak 
serum total calcium level, age, and patient sex.
METHODS: Laboratory data resulting from primary care office visits at our 
institution between January 2016 through December 2017 to evaluate patients who 
had at least 1 episode of hypercalcemia (≥10.5 mg/dL). For each serum calcium 
threshold, we calculated the percentage of patients who were found to have an 
increased parathyroid hormone level (≥65 pg/mL). We determined whether net cost 
savings could be achieved by screening hypercalcemic patients given their 
probability of primary hyperparathyroidism and expected cost savings from 
fracture risk reduction, given their sex and age.
RESULTS: From 155,350 unique patients in the study period, a total of 2,271 had 
a minimum of 1 hypercalcemic lab value. After exclusion criteria, there were 
1,326 patients of whom 27.5% had a parathyroid hormone level checked. Cost 
savings was established at a screening threshold of 10.5 for all patients until 
age 66 years for men and 69 years for women. For men aged 67-68 y and women aged 
70-71 years, the optimal screening threshold was 10.8 mg/dl.
CONCLUSION: Cost savings can be achieved by screening hypercalcemic patients 
with a life expectancy exceeding 16 years, with varying thresholds based on age 
and sex.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the determinants of deprescribing among health 
professionals in nursing homes, focusing on knowledge, practice and attitude.
DESIGN: This was a qualitative study comprising semi-structured face-to-face 
interviews guided by 10 open-ended questions. Interviews were conducted until 
data saturation was achieved and no new ideas were formed. The interviews were 
audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed for themes. To derive themes, 
we employed directed content analysis of transcript data. Coding was completed 
using a combination of open, axial and selective coding.
SETTING: Four nursing homes in Singapore.
PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 17 participants (comprising 4 doctors, 4 
pharmacists and 9 nurses).
RESULTS: Two key themes were identified, enablers and challenges. These were 
enablers and challenges faced by doctors, pharmacists and nurses towards 
deprescribing. The identified subthemes for enablers of deprescribing were: (1) 
awareness of medications that are unnecessary or could be targeted for 
deprescribing; (2) improving quality of life for patients with limited life 
expectancy; (3) improving communication between doctors, pharmacists and nurses; 
(4) systematic deprescribing practice and educational tools and (5) 
acknowledgement of possible benefits of deprescribing. The identified subthemes 
for challenges of deprescribing were: (1) symptoms not acknowledged as possibly 
drug-related; (2) lack of knowledge in patient's and family members' 
preferences; (3) lack of coordination between health professionals in hospitals 
and nursing homes and (4) limited tools for deprescribing. The development of a 
local guideline, mentoring nurses, case discussions, better shared 
decision-making and improving multidisciplinary communication, may help to 
support the process of deprescribing.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study highlighted that deprescribing in the 
nursing homes is perceived by health professionals to be challenging and future 
research could assess how routine case studies, mentoring and better 
multidisciplinary communication could improve deprescribing knowledge and 
process in the nursing homes.

Radiation therapy (RT) is a crucial part of cancer care, but previous work 
suggests that many non-radiation oncologist physicians are uncomfortable 
referring for RT. To evaluate training and understanding of RT, the authors sent 
invitations to complete an online questionnaire to all physicians at a community 
hospital in Bronx, NY, which asked about oncology training and self-rated and 
objective knowledge of RT. Out of 247 invited participants, 87 responded (35%). 
Among responders, 19 were attending physicians (22%) and 66 (76%) were 
residents. Seventy-two percent of respondents reported caring for > 5 cancer 
patients in the past month, but 54% reported never referring patients for RT. 
Sixty-nine percent of respondents stated they received no radiation oncology 
training in medical school, and 36% reported no general oncology training. 
Approximately half believed themselves to be "somewhat knowledgeable" about RT 
indications (48%), benefits (53%), and side effects (55%). Objective assessment 
mean score was 6.2/12 (median 7) for all respondents; Respondents with internal 
medicine specialization scored higher than others (mean 7.7 vs 3.5; p < 0.01). 
Scores did not differ between attending and resident physicians, resident 
post-graduate levels, or receiving oncology training in medical school. The 
factors most commonly cited as affecting RT referral decisions were type of 
cancer, patient wishes, family wishes, poor functional status, and life 
expectancy. Many physicians are unaware of RT effectiveness or indications, 
which may affect referral patterns. Previous oncology training was not 
associated with higher knowledge scores.

Portugal.

BACKGROUND: This work aimed to compare raw fresh meat (minced bovine and pork in 
pieces) preserved by hyperbaric storage (HS) at room-like temperature (75 MPa/25 
°C) and HS at cold temperatures (60 MPa/10 °C) for up to 60 days, being both 
compared to refrigeration (RF, 4 °C).
RESULTS: HS conditions showed microbial load reductions over 60 days of storage, 
leading to a possible shelf-life extension when compared to samples at RF. 
Moreover, between both HS conditions similar results were found at the 60th day, 
reaching in some cases values < 1.00 log CFU g-1 . Overall, pH presented an 
increase with storage for both HS conditions (e.g. over 30 days, from 5.51 ± 
0.02 to 5.70 ± 0.01 and 5.85 ± 0.03, for 60 MPa/10 °C and 75 MPa/25 °C, 
respectively, on pork meat in pieces, PP) contrary to RF where pH values 
decreased (from 5.51 ± 0.02 to 5.33 ± 0.03). Regarding moisture content and drip 
loss, lower and higher values were found, respectively at 75 MPa/25 °C, mainly 
in bovine minced meat. Overall, colour ΔE* did not present considerable 
differences for both samples under all storage conditions. Lipid oxidation 
presented an increase tendency over time, with both HS conditions showing the 
higher values (1.795 ± 0.217 and 2.169 ± 0.117 for 60 MPa/10 °C and 75 MPa/25 
°C, respectively, compared to 0.895 ± 0.084 μg MDA g-1 in PP samples at the 30th 
day).
CONCLUSION: Although several advantages were found further studies should be 
carried out in order to optimize the HS conditions for raw fresh meat and assess 
the impact of this preservation methodology on other meat quality parameters as 
for instance sensorial aspects. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

Family communication about health is critical for the dissemination of 
information that may improve health management of all family members. 
Communication about health issues, attitudes, and behaviors in families is 
associated with life expectancy as well as quality of life for family members. 
This study addresses family communication about health by examining individual 
roles for family health communication and factors related to these roles, among 
families of three different racial/ethnic groups: Caucasians, Latinos, and 
Pacific Islanders. Data were collected from 60 participants recruited as 30 
family dyads, 10 from each group, through qualitative semistructured interviews. 
Interviews were conducted with each participant separately and then together in 
a dyadic interview. Two coders independently coded interview transcripts using 
NVivo 11. Results identified the family health communication roles of collector, 
disseminator, health educator, and researcher. We also identified several 
factors related to these roles using the lens of family systems theory-the 
presence of chronic conditions in the family, previous experience, medical 
education, and family hierarchy. Findings demonstrate many similarities and 
relatively few differences in the family health communication roles and the 
related factors among the families of different race/ethnicity. Conclusions 
highlight implications for future research and intervention development.

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a clinical syndrome that affects millions of people 
worldwide. Although considered as a non-lethal disease, PD shortens the life 
expectancy of the patients. Many studies have been dedicated to evaluating 
methods for early-stage PD detection, which includes machine learning techniques 
that employ, in most cases, motor dysfunctions, such as tremor. This work 
explores the time dependency in tremor signals collected from handwriting exams. 
To learn such temporal information, we propose a model based on Bidirectional 
Gated Recurrent Units along with an attention mechanism. We also introduce the 
concept of "Bag of Samplings" that computes multiple compact representations of 
the signals. Experimental results have shown the proposed model is a promising 
technique with results comparable to some state-of-the-art approaches in the 
literature.

INTRODUCTION: Hip replacement was declared "operation of the century" in tribute 
to the functional improvement it provides. Frequency is increasing, but it is 
difficult to estimate the actual number of procedures performed and the expected 
progression, because of changes in indications and lengthening life-expectancy, 
and also, in France, because there is no registry. As data are lacking in
