separately and mostly aggressively treated. Imaging is of great importance in 
MM. Using MRI focal lesions can be detected even before bone destruction. In 
this year chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell treatment of MM will be 
approved for the first time in Germany. Novel antibody constructs, such as 
belantamab mafodotin, are or will be introduced for a late recurrence.

Publisher: Das multiple Myelom (MM) ist eine der häufigsten Krebserkrankungen 
des blutbildenden Systems. In den vergangenen 60 Jahren hat sich die systemische 
Behandlung mehrfach gewandelt, von Alkylanzien über die Hochdosistherapie 
gefolgt von autologer Transplantation peripherer Blutstammzellen bis zu 
immunmodulatorischen Substanzen und Proteasominhibitoren. Heute befindet sich 
die Therapie des MM erneut im Umbruch. In den letzten Jahren haben monoklonale 
Antikörper die Therapieoptionen entscheidend erweitert. Langzeitremissionen 
werden immer häufiger erreicht. Dank immunonkologischer Therapiefortschritte 
kann in Zukunft die Prognose von intensiv vorbehandelten Patienten mit sehr 
kurzer Lebenserwartung verbessert werden. Es ist zu erwarten, dass das MM 
mittelfristig heilbar wird. Die Konzentration der freien Leichtketten im Serum, 
Läsionen in der Magnetresonanztomographie (MRT) und die Knochenmarkinfiltration 
sind Parameter, die in die Behandlungsindikation einfließen. In klinischen 
Studien werden bereits Patienten mit „smoldering myeloma“ behandelt, um die 
Progression zu verzögern, Remissionsraten zu erhöhen oder Langzeitremissionen 
mit negativer „minimal residual disease“ zu erreichen. Unter Berücksichtigung 
chromosomaler Veränderungen und serologischer Parameter wird die Prognose der 
Patienten mit MM heute sehr gut diskriminiert. In laufenden Studien werden 
Hochrisikopatienten gesondert und meist aggressiver behandelt. Die Bildgebung 
hat beim MM einen hohen Stellenwert. Durch eine MRT lassen sich bereits vor 
einer Knochenzerstörung fokale Läsionen abbilden. In diesem Jahr wird 
die CAR-T-Zell-Therapie beim MM in Deutschland erstmalig zugelassen. Neue 
Antikörperkonstrukte sind oder werden eingeführt, so etwa Belantamab Mafodotin 
für das späte Rezidiv.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this review is to become familiar with the most common 
indications for imaging guided percutaneous bipolar radiofrequency ablation, to 
learn about different technical considerations during performance providing the 
current evidence. Controversies concerning products will be addressed.
METHODS: We performed a literature review excluding non-English studies and case 
reports. All references of the obtained articles were also evaluated for any 
additional information.
RESULTS: RFA achieves cytotoxicity by raising target area temperatures above 
60 °C, and may be used to achieve total necrosis of lesions smaller than 3 cm in 
diameter, to debulk and reduce the pain associated with larger lesions, to 
prevent pathological fractures due to progressive osteolysis or for cavity 
creation aiming for targeted cement delivery in case of posterior vertebral wall 
breaching. Protective ancillary techniques should be used in order to increase 
safety and augment efficacy of RFA in the spine.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of vertebral lesions is a 
reproducible, successful and safe procedure. Ablation should be combined with 
vertebral augmentation in all cases. In order to optimize maximum efficacy a 
patient- and a lesion-tailored approach should both be offered focusing upon 
clinical and performance status along with life expectancy of the patient as 
well as upon lesion characteristics.

BACKGROUND: The neonatal period is the most vulnerable stage of life. In 
Ethiopia, neonatal illness is common and the reduction in neonatal mortality is 
not as significant as for under-five mortality.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and factors associated with neonatal 
illness symptoms reported by mothers delivering in health facilities in 
Northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A repeated measure cross-sectional study design was employed to collect 
data from 358 randomly selected deliveries in 11 health facilities from November 
2018 to March 2019. A pretested and interviewer-administered structured 
questionnaire adapted from the literature was employed to record neonatal 
outcomes (illnesses and/or deaths) at birth, 24 hours, 7th, 14th and 28th day 
from birth. Cleaned data was exported to STATA version 14 software for analysis. 
Multilevel analysis was used to identify individual and facility-level 
characteristics associated with neonatal illness symptoms.
RESULTS: The prevalence of neonatal illness symptoms was 27.8% (95% CI; 23.2, 
32.8) of the 338 babies born alive and the neonatal mortality rate was 41/1000 
live births (14/338). The most common symptoms or conditions of neonatal illness 
reported by mothers' in the study area were possible serious bacterial 
infections (95.8%, 90/94), localized bacterial infections (43.6%, 41/94), low 
birth weight (23.4%, 22/94), diarrhea (18.1%, 17/94), prematurity (14.9%, 
14/94), and jaundice (7.5%, 7/94). Among the babies who died, neonates who had 
possible serious bacterial infections, low birth weight, localized bacterial 
infections, and prematurity took the highest proportions with 100% (14/14), 
64.3% (9/14), 50% (7/14), and 42.9% (6/14), respectively. Having a maximum of 3 
children (AOR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.1-3.6), having twins or triplets during 
pregnancy (AOR = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.1-6.1), and lack of antenatal counseling (AOR 
= 1.83; 95% CI = 1.1-3.3) were among the maternal factors associated with 
neonatal illness. Having low birth length (AOR = 7.93; 95% CI = 3.6-17.3), and 
having a poor breastfeeding quality (AOR = 2.37; 95% CI = 1.4-4.0) were found to 
be the neonatal factors associated with neonatal illness.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a high prevalence of neonatal illness symptoms 
in Northwest Ethiopia. Therefore, early detection, referral and better 
management of symptoms or conditions with a high mortality, like sepsis and low 
birth weight are compulsory to save the lives of many neonates. Strengthening 
the health extension programme to improve antenatal care service utilization and 
breastfeeding quality of neonates among postpartum women is crucial.

Social distancing policies have been widely adopted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. High levels of social connection are positively associated with 
beneficial health outcomes, while social isolation is associated with poor 
long-term health outcomes including reduced life expectancy. The present study 
evaluates the impact of social distancing measures during the early period of 
COVID-19 on substance use behaviors among those in the United States. Methods: 
We used an internet-based survey with participants (n = 157; 86 male) reporting 
a history of problems related to drug use. We relied on ANOVA and logistic 
regression techniques to assess the associations between social connection and 
substance use. Results: People with more severe drug use problems reported 
feeling more socially isolated during social distancing. Those who primarily use 
alcohol reported higher global feelings of social connection than those who 
primarily use opioids. During social distancing, participants reported an 
increase in alcohol and cigarette consumption, and a decrease in cocaine use. 
Lastly, those who reported using drugs for social reasons were less likely to 
have decreased substance use during social distancing. Conclusions: The current 
study provides evidence that social distancing guidelines have impacted both 
substance use behaviors and feelings of social and physical connection. Further, 
there are differential impacts based on drug of choice. These results advance 
delineation of the connection between sociality and drug use.

BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) survivors often suffer from cognitive, 
physical and mental impairments, known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). 
ICU follow-up clinics may improve aftercare of these patients. There is a lack 
of evidence whether or which concept of an ICU follow-up clinic is effective. 
Within the PINA study, a concept for an ICU follow-up clinic was developed and 
will be tested in a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), primarily to 
evaluate the feasibility and additionally the potential efficacy.
METHODS/DESIGN: Design: Pilot RCT with intervention and control (usual care) 
arms plus mixed-methods process evaluation.
PARTICIPANTS: 100 ICU patients (50 per arm) of three ICUs in a university 
hospital (Regensburg, Germany), ≥ 18 years with an ICU stay of > 5 days, a 
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score > 5 during the ICU stay and a 
life expectancy of more than 6 months.
INTERVENTION: The intervention will contain three components: information, 
consultation and networking. Information will be available in form of an 
intensive care guide for patients and next of kin at the ICU and phone support 
during follow-up. For consultation, patients will visit the ICU follow-up clinic 
at least once during the first 6 months after discharge from ICU. During these 
visits, patients will be screened for symptoms of PICS and, if required, 
referred to specialists for further treatment. The networking part (e.g. special 
referral letter from the ICU follow-up clinic) aims to provide a network of 
outpatient care providers for former ICU patients. Feasibility Outcomes: 
Qualitative and quantitative evaluation will be used to explore reasons for 
non-participation and the intervention´s acceptability to patients and 
caregivers. Efficacy Outcomes: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be 
assessed as primary outcome by the physical component score (PCS) of the 
Short-Form 12 Questionnaire (SF-12). Secondary outcomes encompass further 
patient-reported outcomes. All outcomes are assessed at 6 months after discharge 
from ICU.
DISCUSSION: The PINA study will determine feasibility and potential efficacy of 
a complex intervention in a pilot RCT to enhance follow-up care of ICU 
survivors. The pilot study is an important step for further studies in the field 
of ICU aftercare and especially for the implementation of a pragmatic 
multi-centre RCT.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to undertake an economic evaluation of patient direct 
access to physiotherapy in the UK NHS by comparing the number of patients 
treated, waiting time, cost and health gain from a direct access pathway versus 
traditional GP-referral to NHS physiotherapy.
DESIGN: The authors used a discrete event simulation (DES) model to represent a 
hypothetical GP practice of 10,000 patients. Costs were measured from the 
perspective of the NHS and society. Outcomes were predicted waiting times, the 
total number of patients with musculoskeletal conditions who received 
physiotherapy and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, each estimated 
over a one year period. Model inputs were based on a pilot cluster randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) conducted in four general practices in Cheshire, UK, and 
other sources from the literature.
RESULTS: Direct access could increase the number of patients receiving at least 
one physiotherapy appointment by 63%, but without investment in extra 
physiotherapist capacity would increase waiting time dramatically. The increase 
in activity is associated with a cost of £4999 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct access to physiotherapy services would be cost-effective and 
benefit patients given current cost per QALY thresholds used in England. This is 
because physiotherapy itself is cost-effective, rather than through savings in 
GP time. Direct access without an increase in supply of physiotherapists would 
increase waiting times and would be unlikely to be cost saving for the NHS owing 
to the likely increase in the use of physiotherapy services.

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators for cystic 
fibrosis: a new dawn?

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting inherited condition in 
Caucasians. It is a multisystem autosomal recessive disorder caused by variants 
in the gene for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 
protein, a cell-surface localised chloride channel that regulates absorption and 
secretion of salt and water across epithelia. Until recently, the treatment for 
CF was predicated on ameliorating and preventing the downstream symptoms of CFTR 
dysfunction, primarily recurrent respiratory infections and pancreatic exocrine 
failure. But a new class of therapy-the CFTR modulators, which treat the basic 
defect and decrease the complications of CF, leads to significantly improved 
pulmonary function, decreased respiratory infections and improved nutrition. The 
newest agent, a combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, will be 
suitable for approximately 90% of all people with CF and is likely to decrease 
the morbidity and significantly increase the life expectancy for most people 
with CF. The major barrier to their widespread introduction has been their cost, 
with many countries unwilling or unable to fund them. Nevertheless, such is 
their therapeutic efficacy and their likely potent effect on life expectancy 
that their advent has wider societal implications for the care of children and 
adults with CF.

BACKGROUND: The progressive increase in life expectancy of people with 
intellectual disability (ID) has resulted in enhanced survival into old age and 
has also seen a growth in research on both lifelong and emerging ageing-related 
health issues. Health issues amongst provider-supported adults have been 
previously studied, but these studies have not always included older 
community-dwelling adults with ID.
METHODS: A study examining the extent of mental health of 391 community-dwelling 
adults with ID age 60 and older in both metropolitan and rural areas of two East 
Coast Australian states was undertaken using a cross-sectional survey. Examined 
were a range of demographic (age, sex, living arrangements, employment and 
socio-economic status) and life (co-morbidities, adverse life events and social 
support) factors. Data were parsed by two age groupings (60-65: n = 234 and >65: 
n = 157).
RESULTS: Findings revealed that older community-dwelling adults with ID have 
many of the same mental health disorders as do other ageing people, with the 
exception of significant psychiatric disorders often associated with older age. 
Over a third (35%: n = 137) reported some one or more mental health disorders. 
Age, sex, location (rural or urban), financial hardship, social support or type 
of living arrangement were not statistically significant as risk factors for 
poor mental health. However, employment status was a clear predictor. Stepwise 
regression models showed a strong association between mental ill-health and 
adverse life events and between mental ill-health and multiple physical 
co-morbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: The cross-sectional nature of the study limits causal inference. 
The cumulative effect of chronic health conditions and adverse life events 
cannot be prevented retrospectively. However, greater awareness amongst both 
health professionals and care staff that older adults with ID have a high 
likelihood of significant and/or repeated traumas and need better health care to 
limit physical co-morbidity may assist in providing support that is better 
tailored to individual needs in older age to reduce the burden of mental 
ill-health.

BACKGROUND: Aphis gossypii, a polyphagous and recurrent pest induced by 
pesticides, causes tremendous loss crop yields each year. Previous studies on 
the mechanism of pesticide-induced sublethal effects mainly focus on the gene 
level. The symbiotic bacteria are also important participants of this mechanism, 
but their roles in hormesis are still unclear.
RESULTS: In this study, life table parameters and 16S rRNA sequencing were 
applied to evaluate the sublethal and transgenerational effects of sulfoxaflor 
on adult A. gossypii after 24-h LC20 (6.96 mg L-1 ) concentration exposure. The 
results indicated that the LC20 of sulfoxaflor significantly reduced the finite 
rate of increase (λ) and net reproductive rate (R0 ) of parent generation (G0), 
and significantly increased mean generation time (T) of G1 and G2, but not of G3 
and G4. Both reproductive period and fecundity of G1 and G2 were significantly 
higher than those of the control. Furthermore, our sequencing data revealed that 
more than 95% bacterial communities were dominated by the phylum Proteobacteria, 
in which the maximum proportion genus was the primary symbiont Buchnera and the 
facultative symbiont Arsenophonus. Compared to those of the control, the 
abundance and composition of symbiotic bacteria of A. gossypii for three 
successive generations (G0-G2) were changed after G0 A. gossypii was exposed to 
sulfoxaflor: the diversity of the bacterial community was decreased, but the 
abundance of Buchnera was increased (G0), while the abundance of Arsenophonus 
was decreased. Contrary to G0, G1 and G2 cotton aphid exhibited an increased 
relative abundance of Arsenophonus in the sublethal treatment group.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results provide an insight into the interactions 
among pesticide resistance, aphids, and symbionts, which will eventually help to 
better manage the resurgence of A. gossypii. © 2021 Society of Chemical

BACKGROUND: Rupture of the distal tendon of the biceps is a pathology with an 
increasing incidence, which can cause important functional alterations. When the 
rupture is complete and the patient is active, surgical treatment is of choice.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: 47-year-old man with sudden and intense pain in the left 
antecubital fossa while lifting weight. On examination, impotence for flexion 
and active supination of the left arm with loss of the biceps silhouette. 
Ultrasonography confirms the diagnosis of complete rupture of the distal biceps 
tendon. Surgical treatment was decided, performing a single anterior approach 
and reinserting the tendon in its radial footprint with the help of a cortical 
anchorage device.
RESULTS: At 12 months, the patient presented flexo-extension and complete prone 
supination, without encountering difficulties in carrying out the activities of 
his daily and work life, with a score of 100 points in the Mayo Elbow 
Performance Score (MEPS).
CONCLUSION: Rupture of the distal biceps is a typical injury in active patients 
with an increasing incidence. Although there have been no significant 
differences between the different repair options, in our experience the use of 
cortical anchorage devices with a single anterior approach provides very 
satisfactory results.

Publisher: ANTECEDENTES: La rotura del tendón distal del bíceps braquial es una 
patología con una incidencia creciente, que puede ocasionar importantes 
alteraciones funcionales. Cuando la rotura es completa y el paciente activo, el 
tratamiento quirúrgico es de elección. Resultados: A los 12 meses, el paciente 
presenta flexo-extensión y prono-supinación completa, sin encontrar dificultades 
para realizar las actividades de su vida diaria y laboral, con puntación de 100 
puntos en el Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS).
MATERIAL Y MÉTODO: Varón de 47 años con dolor intenso y súbito en la fosa 
antecubital izquierda mientras levantaba peso. A la exploración, impotencia para 
la flexión y supinación activa del brazo izquierdo con pérdida de la silueta del 
bíceps braquial. La ecografía confirma el diagnóstico de rotura completa del 
tendón distal del bíceps braquial. Se decide tratamiento quirúrgico, realizando 
un abordaje único anterior  y reinsertando el tendón en su "footprint" radial 
con ayuda de un dispositivo de anclaje cortical.
CONCLUSIÓN: La rotura del bíceps distal es una lesión típica de pacientes 
activos con una incidencia creciente. Aunque no se han evidenciado diferencias

Albumin is an appealing carrier in nanomedicine because of its unique features. 
First, it is the most abundant protein in plasma, endowing high 
biocompatibility, biodegradability, nonimmunogenicity, and safety for its 
clinical application. Second, albumin chemical structure and conformation allows 
interaction with many different drugs, potentially protecting them from 
elimination and metabolism in vivo, thus improving their pharmacokinetic 
properties. Finally, albumin can interact with receptors overexpressed in many 
diseased tissues and cells, providing a unique feature for active targeting of 
the disease site without the addition of specific ligands to the nanocarrier. 
For this reason, albumin, characterized by an extended serum half-life of around 
19 days, has the potential of promoting half-life extension and targeted 
delivery of drugs. Therefore, this article focuses on the importance of albumin 
as a nanodrug delivery carrier for hydrophobic drugs, taking advantage of the 
passive as well as active targeting potential of this nanocarrier. Particular 
attention is paid to the breakthrough NAB-Technology, with emphasis on the 
advantages of Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane), compared to the solvent-based 
formulations of Paclitaxel, i.e., CrEL-paclitaxel (Taxol) in a clinical setting. 
Finally, the role of albumin in carrying anticancer compounds is depicted, with 
a particular focus on the albumin-based formulations that are currently 
undergoing clinical trials. The article sheds light on the power of an 
endogenous substance, such as albumin, as a drug delivery system, signifies the 
importance of the drug vehicle in drug performance in the biological systems, 
and highlights the possible future trends in the use of this drug delivery 
system.

Background Coronary revascularization provides important long-term clinical 
benefits to patients with high-risk presentations of coronary artery disease, 
including those with chronic kidney disease. The cost-effectiveness of coronary 
interventions in this setting is not known. Methods and Results We developed a 
Markov cohort simulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 
patients with chronic kidney disease who were hospitalized with acute myocardial 
infarction or unstable angina. Model inputs were primarily drawn from a sample 
of 14 300 patients identified using the Medicare 20% sample. Survival, 
quality-adjusted life-years, costs, and cost-effectiveness were projected over a 
20-year time horizon. Multivariable models indicated higher 30-day mortality and 
end-stage renal disease with both PCI and CABG, and higher stroke with CABG, 
relative to medical therapy. However, the model projected long-term gains of 
0.72 quality-adjusted life-years (0.97 life-years) for PCI compared with medical 
therapy, and 0.93 quality-adjusted life-years (1.32 life-years) for CABG 
compared with PCI. Incorporation of long-term costs resulted in incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of $65 326 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for 
PCI versus medical therapy, and $101 565 for CABG versus PCI. Results were 
robust to changes in input parameters but strongly influenced by the background 
costs of the population, and the time horizon. Conclusions For patients with 
chronic kidney disease and high-risk coronary artery disease presentations, PCI 
and CABG were both associated with markedly increased costs as well as gains in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
indicating intermediate value in health economic terms.

Objectives: This study compares the associations of two subjective lifetime 
perspectives, subjective age (SA) and subjective life expectancy (SLE), with 
physical performance, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms. Methods: 64 
91-year-old participants were selected from three waves of the Longitudinal 
Aging Study Amsterdam (2008/09, 2011/12, 2015/16; n = 1822 participants, n = 
3500 observations) that included graphical and numerical measures of SA and SLE. 
We used generalized estimating equations to examine their associations with 
health. Results: Associations of SA/SLE with health were weaker for physical 
performance than for self-rated health and depressive symptoms. The associations 
of SA and SLE with physical performance were of similar magnitude but with 
self-rated health depended on the type of measure. Depressive symptoms, instead, 
showed a stronger association with SA than with SLE. Graphical measures showed 
weaker associations than numerical measures. Discussion: The way in which 
subjective lifetime perspectives and health are conceptualized and measured 
influences the strength of their associations.

Probiotics are microorganisms that confer health benefits to host. Well-known 
examples include Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. In recent years, 
interest in promoting our health with probiotics has grown as life expectancy 
and health awareness has increased. However, some concerns for safety and 
stability exist for these live organisms. Thus, "postbiotics" and 
"paraprobiotics," non-viable heat-killed microbial cells or cell fractions that 
retain health benefits, are increasingly favored. Unfortunately, little 
information on clinical efficacy and mechanisms of action is available compared 
with many available probiotics. Lacticaseibacillus (previous name Lactobacillus) 
paracasei MCC1849 is a commonly used lactic acid bacterial strain in Japan that 
displays immuno-modulatory effects in humans in non-viable heat-killed form. 
This review discusses health benefits of heat-killed L. paracasei MCC1849 immune 
modulation and offers a theoretical basis for its mechanisms of action. We also 
discuss the feasibility of using heat-killed probiotics for application in food 
products.

OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive care for people living with human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) (PLH) includes the promotion of healthier habits, including physical 
activity (PA). This study aimed to describe a multicomponent pragmatic trial 
protocol to assess the effect of PA in preventing body changes and metabolic 
disturbances, improving the quality of life of PLH starting antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) and present cohort characteristics.
METHODS: PLH undergoing ART for ≤4 months were recruited for a randomized trial. 
The intervention comprised three cardiorespiratory and/or strength training 
sessions per week at the clinic or in public spaces for 6 months under on-site 
or remote supervision, and educational sessions. Participants' PA levels, 
cardiorespiratory fitness, anthropometric measures, strength, flexibility, 
quality of life, and laboratory monitoring (blood glucose and lipids, CD4 
counts) at baseline and post-intervention will be compared. The pragmatic design 
aims to enable the assessment of intervention effectiveness in real-life 
conditions.
RESULTS: At baseline, our cohort of 38 recently diagnosed patients (mean time 
since HIV diagnosis and duration of ART were 3 and 2.58 months, respectively) 
were predominantly male, young, with high schooling and good immune status 
(median CD4 count=498 cells/mm3). Twenty-two (57.9%) patients reported a PA 
below the World Health Organization recommendations. We found baseline normal 
anthropometric measures and metabolic parameters: below-average trunk flexion 
and elbow extension strength, poor handgrip strength and flexibility, and high 
quality of life scores in all except the physical domain.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding how effective PA is in preventing body changes and 
metabolic disturbances, and in improving the quality of PLH starting ART may 
help establish guidelines to better incorporate PA in HIV care.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify factors, including physical functions 
and activities that affect quality of life (QOL) at discharge among patients 
with osteoporotic vertebral fractures.
METHODS: Patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures were included in our 
prospective cohort study. Multiple regression analysis was performed to 
determine the predictors of QOL at discharge using two models: model 1, basic 
medical information and physical functions at admission, and model 2, basic 
medical information, physical function, and activity after 4 weeks of admission.
RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis (standard partial regression coefficients) 
using model 1 identified L2 to L4 bone mineral density (-0.2), Visual Analog 
Scale for pain during activity at admission (-0.31), and Revised Hasegawa 
Dementia Scale (HDS-R) score at admission (0.64) as factors affecting QOL at 
discharge. Multiple regression analysis using model 2 identified HDS-R at 
admission (0.64), Pain Catastrophizing Scale score at 4 weeks (-0.34), and knee 
extension muscle strength at 4 weeks (0.28) as factors affecting QOL at 
discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that if patients have high bone mineral 
density, intense pain, and low cognitive function at admission, then low QOL at 
discharge will be predicted; however, improvement of pain catastrophizing and 
knee extension muscle strength during first the 4 weeks of admission may be able 
to improve QOL at discharge. Because patients in this study were Japanese only, 
it is important to exercise caution when applying our results to other 
populations.

The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) theory provides an evolutionary explanation for 
the existence of consistent among-individual variation in behaviour, or animal 
personality. Herein, individuals with a fast lifestyle are considered to be 
bolder and should take more risks resulting in a lower life expectancy compared 
to shyer individuals with a slower lifestyle. However, this assumption depends 
on the levels of intra-specific competition that the individuals experience 
which has rarely been tested in species that experience large changes in 
competition on a very short time scale. We used the multimammate mice (Mastomys 
natalensis) as a model system to study the POLS assumption by investigating the 
effects of two personality traits (exploration and stress-sensitivity) on 
survival, maturation (a proxy for reproductive investment) and recapture 
probability during one population cycle (Nindividuals = 201). Such a cycle 
consists of two phases in which the levels of intra-specific competition vary 
drastically. We found that only one personality trait, namely 
stress-sensitivity, had a negative effect on both survival and recapture 
probability but none of them affected maturation. This suggests that less 
stress-sensitive individuals take more risks in the wild and have a higher 
survival probability compared to high stress-sensitive individuals. However, the 
effect of personality on survival was only present during the population 
decrease phase, when the levels of intra-specific competition are high due to a 
scarcity of food. This suggests that seasonal changes in competition might be 
important in the evolution and maintenance of animal personalities in species 
whose population dynamics have a clear seasonal component.

BACKGROUND: This study reports the use of low glycemic sunflower pectin gel, 
elaborated with calcium and without or with sweeteners (sucrose, stevia and 
saccharin) as an edible coating and its possible combination with two modified 
atmosphere packaging (MAP), in order to extend shelf life, maintaining the 
quality, of strawberries during the storage at 4 °C.
RESULTS: This pectin coating, formed with only calcium and/or stevia or 
saccharin, extended the shelf life of strawberries with respect to uncoating 
fruits, up to 12 days, keeping the microbial load constant, the firmness and 
less weight loss. With the same edible coatings, the shelf life of strawberries 
was extended up to 23 days when they were combined with MAP [10% carbon dioxide 
(CO2 ), 85% nitrogen (N2 ) and 5% oxygen (O2 )], maintaining the quality of 
strawberries, while the other MAP, with a higher CO2 concentration (20% CO2 , 
75% N2 and 5% O2 ), had no effect.
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the suitability of the combination of 
edible pectin coating combined with MAP to obtain an important shelf life 
extension, maintaining the good quality of the fruit. © 2021 Society of Chemical

INTRODUCTION: Cochlear implantation is a recent approach proposed to treat 
single-sided deafness (SSD) and asymmetric hearing loss (AHL). Several cohort 
studies showed its effectiveness on tinnitus and variable results on binaural 
hearing. The main objective of this study is to assess the outcomes of cochlear 
implantation and other treatment options in SSD/AHL on quality of life.
METHODS: This prospective multicenter study was conducted in 7 tertiary 
university hospitals and included an observational cohort study of SSD/AHL adult 
patients treated using contralateral routing of the signal (CROS) hearing aids 
or bone-anchored hearing systems (BAHSs) or who declined all treatments, and a 
randomized controlled trial in subjects treated by cochlear implantation, after 
failure of CROS and BAHS trials. In total, 155 subjects with SSD or AHL, with or 
without associated tinnitus, were enrolled. After 2 consecutive trials with CROS 
hearing aids and BAHSs on headband, all subjects chose any of the 4 treatment 
options (abstention, CROS, BAHS, or cochlear implant [CI]). The subjects who 
opted for a CI were randomized between 2 arms (CI vs. initial observation). Six 
months after the treatment choice, quality of life was assessed using both 
generic (EuroQoL-5D, EQ-5D) and auditory-specific quality-of-life indices 
(Nijmegen Cochlear implant Questionnaire [NCIQ] and Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] 
for tinnitus severity). Performances for speech-in-noise recognition and 
localization were measured as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: CROS was chosen by 75 subjects, while 51 opted for cochlear 
implantation, 18 for BAHSs, and 11 for abstention. Six months after treatment, 
both EQ-5D VAS and auditory-specific quality-of-life indices were significantly 
better in the "CI" arm versus "observation" arm. The mean effect of the CI was 
particularly significant in subjects with associated severe tinnitus (mean 
improvement of 20.7 points ± 19.7 on EQ-5D VAS, 20.4 ± 12.4 on NCIQ, and 51.4 ± 
35.4 on tinnitus). No significant effect of the CI was found on binaural hearing 
results. Before/after comparisons showed that the CROS and BAHS also improved 
significantly NCIQ scores (for CROS: +7.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 
[4.5; 10.8]; for the BAHS: +14.3, 95% CI = [7.9; 20.7]).
CONCLUSION: Cochlear implantation leads to significant improvements in quality 
of life in SSD and AHL patients, particularly in subjects with associated severe 
tinnitus, who are thereby the best candidates to an extension of CI indications.

Asthma is an inflammatory lung disease that affects more women than men in 
adulthood. Clinical evidence shows that hormonal fluctuation during the 
menstrual cycle and menopause are related to increased asthma severity in women. 
Considering that life expectancy has increased and that most women now undergo 
menopause, strategies to prevent the worsening of asthma symptoms are 
particularly important. A recent study from our group showed that re-exposure of 
ovariectomised allergic mice to antigen (ovalbumin) leads to an exacerbation of 
lung inflammation that is similar to clinical conditions. However, little is 
known about the role of probiotics in the prevention of asthma exacerbations 
during the menstrual cycle or menopause. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the 
effects of supplementation with kefir, a popular fermented dairy beverage, as a 
preventive strategy for modulating allergic disease. The results show that the 
preventive kefir administration decreases the influx of inflammatory cells in 
the airways and exacerbates the production of mucus and the interleukin 13 
cytokine. Additionally, kefir changes macrophage polarisation by decreasing the 
number of M2 macrophages, as shown by RT-PCR assay. Thus, kefir is a functional 
food that potentially prevents allergic airway inflammation exacerbations in 
ovariectomised mice.
