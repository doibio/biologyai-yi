reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery for unstable ankle fractures in 
older adults.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to (1) determine if CCC for unstable ankle fractures in 
adults aged over 60 years resulted in equivalent clinical outcome compared with 
ORIF, (2) estimate cost-effectiveness to the NHS and society and (3) explore 
participant experiences.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentre, equivalence randomised controlled trial 
incorporating health economic evaluation and qualitative study.
SETTING: Trauma and orthopaedic departments of 24 NHS hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged over 60 years with unstable ankle fracture. Those with 
serious limb or concomitant disease or substantial cognitive impairment were 
excluded.
INTERVENTIONS: CCC was conducted under anaesthetic in theatre by surgeons who 
attended training. ORIF was as per local practice. Participants were randomised 
in 1 : 1 allocation via remote telephone randomisation. Sequence generation was 
by random block size, with stratification by centre and fracture pattern.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Follow-up was conducted at 6 weeks and, by blinded 
outcome assessors, at 6 months after randomisation. The primary outcome was the 
Olerud-Molander Ankle Score (OMAS), a patient-reported assessment of ankle 
function, at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were quality of life (as measured by 
the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions, Short Form questionnaire-12 items), 
pain, ankle range of motion and mobility (as measured by the timed up and go 
test), patient satisfaction and radiological measures. In accordance with 
equivalence trial US Food and Drug Administration guidance, primary analysis was 
per protocol.
RESULTS: We recruited 620 participants, 95 from the pilot and 525 from the 
multicentre phase, between June 2010 and November 2013. The majority of 
participants, 579 out of 620 (93%), received the allocated treatment; 52 out of 
275 (19%) who received CCC later converted to ORIF because of loss of fracture 
reduction. CCC resulted in equivalent ankle function compared with ORIF at 6 
months {OMAS 64.5 points [standard deviation (SD) 22.4 points] vs. OMAS 66.0 
points (SD 21.1 points); mean difference -0.65 points, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) -3.98 to 2.68 points; standardised effect size -0.04, 95% CI -0.23 to 
0.15}. There were no differences in quality of life, ankle motion, pain, 
mobility and patient satisfaction. Infection and/or wound problems were more 
common with ORIF [29/298 (10%) vs. 4/275 (1%)], as were additional operating 
theatre procedures [17/298 (6%) vs. 3/275 (1%)]. Malunion was more common with 
CCC [38/249 (15%) vs. 8/274 (3%); p < 0.001]. Malleolar non-union was lower in 
the ORIF group [lateral: 0/274 (0%) vs. 8/248 (3%); p = 0.002; medial: 3/274 
(1%) vs. 18/248 (7%); p < 0.001]. During the trial, CCC showed modest mean cost 
savings [NHS mean difference -£644 (95% CI -£1390 to £76); society mean 
difference -£683 (95% CI -£1851 to £536)]. Estimates showed some imprecision. 
Incremental quality-adjusted life-years following CCC were no different from 
ORIF. Over common willingness-to-pay thresholds, the probability that CCC was 
cost-effective was very high (> 95% from NHS perspective and 85% from societal 
perspective). Experiences of treatments were similar; both groups endured the 
impact of fracture, uncertainty regarding future function and the need for 
further interventions.
LIMITATIONS: Assessors at 6 weeks were necessarily not blinded. The 
learning-effect analysis was inconclusive because of limited CCC applications 
per surgeon.
CONCLUSIONS: CCC provides a clinically equivalent outcome to ORIF at reduced 
cost to the NHS and to society at 6 months.
FUTURE WORK: Longer-term follow-up of trial participants is under way to address 
concerns over potential later complications or additional procedures and their 
potential to impact on ankle function. Further study of the patient factors, 
radiological fracture patterns and outcomes, treatment responses and prognosis 
would also contribute to understanding the treatment pathway.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the aging process tends to lead to sarcopenia 
and osteoporosis which reduce the quality of life in older women. Resistance 
training (RT) is widely supported as a means of delaying or offsetting the 
decline in muscle strength and loss of bone mineral content in older women. The 
purpose of this investigation was to analyze the effects of a 12-wk RT program 
(3 times a week) with dietary intake maintenance on muscle strength and body 
composition of healthy, sedentary older women.
METHODS: Forty-four older women were randomly assigned to a RT program (N.=22, 
66.3±4.8 years, 60.7±9.1 kg, 153.1±0.90 cm, 24.9±3.3 kg/m²) or a control group 
(N.=22, 66.4±4.0 years, 63.3±7.5 kg, 155.5±5.8 cm, 26.2±2.6 kg/m²) performing 
stretching exercises during the same period. One-repetition maximum test on 
chest press and leg extension were used to assess muscle strength. Body 
composition was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry to determine fat 
mass, fat-free mass, and bone mineral content. Dietary intake was recorded using 
a 3-day food records. All subjects maintained their normal diet during the 
investigation.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found for the body composition 
components within and between groups. A significant time by group interaction 
indicated that the RT group made greater improvements in upper and lower limb 
muscle strength (chest press ~12%, P=0.0001; leg extension ~13%, P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RT program improves muscle strength of 
major muscle groups, without altering body composition in older women under 
dietary intake maintenance.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a Gammaherpesvirus that causes 
acute infection and establishes life-long latency. KSHV causes several human 
cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, an acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
(AIDS)-related form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Genipin, an aglycone derived from 
geniposide found in Gardenia jasminoides, is known to be an excellent natural 
cross-linker, strong apoptosis inducer, and antiviral agent. Although evidence 
suggests antiviral activity of genipin in several in vitro viral infection 
systems, no inhibitory effect of genipin on KSHV infection has been reported. 
Thus, our aim was to determine, using the iSLK-BAC16 KSHV infection system, 
whether genipin has inhibitory effects on KSHV infection. For this purpose, we 
evaluated biological effects of genipin on KSHV infection and finally determined 
the underlying mechanisms responsible for the bioactive effects of genipin. A 
cytotoxicity assay revealed that genipin caused 50% cytotoxicity at 49.5 μM in 
iSLK-puro (KSHV-negative) cells and at 72.5 μM in iSLK-BAC16 (KSHV-positive) 
cells. Caspase 3/7 activities were slightly suppressed by genipin treatment in 
iSLK-BAC16 cells while significantly induced in iSLK-puro cells. Production of 
the KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), but not that of the 
R-transactivator (RTA) protein, was significantly induced by genipin treatment 
at lower concentration. Consistent with the LANA upregulation, KSHV LANA 
transcripts, but not RTA transcripts, were expressed at a higher level. 
Furthermore, KSHV intracellular copy numbers were slightly increased at lower 
concentration of genipin, while KSHV extracellular copy numbers were 
significantly increased at higher concentration of genipin. Interestingly, 
genipin treatment at a lower concentration did induce the expression of DNA 
(cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1); however, a co-immunoprecipitation 
assay showed that the DNMT1 and LANA induced by genipin did not co-precipitate 
from iSLK-BAC16 cells. Moreover, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay 
demonstrated that genipin treatment enhanced the binding of CCCTC-binding factor 
(CTCF) to the CTCF-binding site in the KSHV latency control region but 
suppressed the binding of structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 3 (SMC3) 
to this site. Genipin treatment also led to the recruitment of additional RNA 
polymerase to the majority of binding sites of some interesting proteins in the 
KSHV latency control region, which might be related to the extension of S phase 
in iSLK-BAC16 cells by genipin treatment. Finally, genipin treatment at lower 
concentration could promote the KSHV latent replication. In contrast, the 
treatment at higher concentration could induce the KSHV lytic replication. In 
conclusion, genipin was shown to be an interesting reagent, which we used to 
manipulate KSHV life cycle in KSHV latently infected cells.

IMPORTANCE: Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) of the recurrent laryngeal 
nerve (RLN) is used as a tool to decrease the rate of nerve injury, although 
study findings are divergent on IONM efficacy. The cost-effectiveness of this 
approach to total thyroidectomy has not been well studied.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether IONM is a cost-effective intervention in the 
setting of total thyroidectomy.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This study creates a decision-tree model of total 
thyroidectomy to analyze, from a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness of 
universal IONM (ie, use in every case) vs selective IONM (ie, high-risk cases 
including reoperative cases, substernal or toxic goiters, and cases with known 
cancer) vs no IONM (visual identification only). Parameters for the model were 
derived from review of the literature, and deterministic and probabilistic 
analyses were performed to test the model's robustness. All analyses were 
performed from the model; there were no human participants.
INTERVENTIONS: Modeled total thyroidectomy with and without IONM of the RLN.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness of universal IONM vs selective 
IONM vs visual identification only of the RLN.
RESULTS: Visual identification of the RLN led to a cost savings of $179.40 and 
$683.20 per patient, and an improvement of 0.001 and 0.004 quality-adjusted 
life-years, over selective IONM and universal IONM, respectively. Visual 
identification was the most cost-effective approach, despite variations in costs 
and utilities in both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In a 
1-way sensitivity analysis, decreasing the probability of RLN injury with IONM 
made selective IONM more cost-effective. When the rate of RLN injury for visual 
identification was kept constant (at 3.86%), selective IONM became the most 
cost-effective approach when its RLN injury rate dropped below 1.9%. As the rate 
of RLN injury with IONM dropped below 50.4% of the visual identification RLN 
injury rate, selective IONM became the most cost-effective approach.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Visual identification of the RLN is more 
cost-effective than any use of IONM. If a clinician can, with use of IONM, 
decrease the rate of RLN injury by 50.4% or more compared with visual 
identification, selective use of IONM in high-risk cases is most cost-effective.

The introduction of immunotherapies into clinical practice has substantially 
improved the prognosis of metastatic melanoma patients as well as patients 
suffering from other cancers. The two FDA-approved checkpoint inhibitors against 
PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) have been shown to significantly improve 
patient survival while being less toxic than previous treatment options. Areas 
covered: The current scientific literature on safety and adverse events (AEs) 
related to anti-PD-1 therapies has been investigated with special attention to 
case reports and to the latest results announced at the major clinical cancer 
and melanoma meetings, including ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology), 
ESMO (European Society of medical Oncology) and EADO (European Association of 
Dermato-Oncology) annual meetings. Expert opinion: Even though anti-PD-1 
therapies are better tolerated than conventional chemo- or other 
immune-therapies, they still induce a plethora of AEs. Given the mechanism of 
action, it is supposed that most if not all of them are immune related. 
Fortunately, the majority are mild and manageable. However, due to the increase 
in patients' life expectancy, there is a substantial need to understand and 
prevent severe cutaneous, pulmonary, neurological and other AEs which have major 
impact on the quality of life. The safety profile after long term use of these 
medications is still unclear. In addition, non-steroid based immune 
interventions to control autoimmunity are still to be developed.

BACKGROUND: Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is a major risk factor for 
perinatal mortality and morbidity. Thus, there is a compelling need to introduce 
sensitive measures to detect IUGR fetuses. Routine third trimester 
ultrasonography is increasingly used to detect IUGR. However, we lack evidence 
for its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and information on ethical 
considerations of additional third trimester ultrasonography. This nationwide 
stepped wedge cluster-randomized trial examines the (cost-)effectiveness of 
routine third trimester ultrasonography in reducing severe adverse perinatal 
outcome through subsequent protocolized management.
METHODS: For this trial, 15,000 women with a singleton pregnancy receiving care 
in 60 participating primary care midwifery practices will be included at 
22 weeks of gestation. In the intervention (n = 7,500) and control group 
(n = 7,500) fetal growth will be monitored by serial fundal height assessments. 
All practices will start offering the control condition (ultrasonography based 
on medical indication). Every three months, 20 practices will be randomized to 
the intervention condition, i.e. apart from ultrasonography if indicated, two 
routine ultrasound examinations will be performed (at 28-30 weeks and 34-36 
weeks). If IUGR is suspected, both groups will receive subsequent clinical 
management as described in the IRIS study protocol that will be developed before 
the start of the trial. The primary dichotomous clinical composite outcome is 
'severe adverse perinatal outcome' up to 7 days after birth, including: 
perinatal death; Apgar score <4 at 5 minutes after birth; impaired 
consciousness; need for assisted ventilation for more than 24 h; asphyxia; 
septicemia; meningitis; bronchopulmonary dysplasia; intraventricular hemorrhage; 
cystic periventricular leukomalacia; neonatal seizures or necrotizing 
enterocolitis. For the economic evaluation, costs will be measured from a 
societal perspective. Quality of life will be measured using the EQ-5D-5 L to 
enable calculation of QALYs. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will 
be performed. In a qualitative sub-study (using diary notes from 32 women for 
9 months, at least 10 individual interviews and 2 focus group studies) we will 
explore ethical considerations of additional ultrasonography and how to deal 
with them.
DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will assist healthcare providers and 
policymakers in making an evidence-based decision about whether or not 
introducing routine third trimester ultrasonography.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the contribution of specific physical activity 
(PA) types (i.e. walking, cycling, domestic work, sports and gardening) on total 
life expectancy (LE) and LE with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: We constructed multistate life tables to calculate the effects of total 
PA and PA types on LE, among individuals older than 55 years from the Rotterdam 
Study. For the life table calculations, we used sex-specific prevalences, 
incident rates and hazard ratios for three transitions (healthy-to-CVD, 
healthy-to-death and CVD-to-death) by levels of PA and adjusted for confounders.
RESULTS: High total PA was associated with gains in total and CVD-free LE. High 
cycling contributed to higher total LE in men (3.7 years) and women (2.1 years) 
and higher LE without CVD in men (3.1 years) and women (2.4 years). Total and 
CVD-free LE were increased by high domestic work in women (2.6 and 2.4 years, 
respectively) and high gardening in men (2.7 and 2.0 years, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher PA levels are associated with increased LE and more years 
lived without CVD. Of the different PA types, cycling provided high effects in 
both men and women. Cycling could be more strongly encouraged in activity 
guidelines to maximize the population benefits of PA.

The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our 
understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem 
functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and 
effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 
permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a 
globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued 
biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest productivity 
worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest 
productivity alone-US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our 
estimation-is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global 
conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of 
biodiversity values, forest management strategies, and conservation priorities.

Gendered differences in AIDS and AIDS-related cause of death among youth with 
secondary education in South Africa, 2009-2011.

of the Witwatersrand , Johannesburg , South Africa .

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is higher among females than males in Sub-Saharan 
Africa. Education is associated with better health outcomes. For this and other 
reasons, African countries have made a concerted effort to increase youth 
education rates. However, in South Africa males have lower secondary education 
rates than females, yet females have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS. This study 
examines if a gender disparity exists in AIDS mortality rates among youth with 
secondary education in South Africa.
METHODS: This study uses descriptive statistics and life table techniques. A 
sample of 4386 deaths of youth with secondary education is used. Of this total 
sample, 987 deaths were among males and 340 were among females with secondary 
education.
RESULTS: This study shows that AIDS mortality is higher among females than males 
in South Africa. Males and females with secondary education have lower AIDS 
mortality than all males and females in the population, yet the rates are higher 
for females. Using cause-deleted life tables, the probability of youth dying 
from HIV/AIDS practically disappears for both males and females. Odds ratio 
calculations show that secondary education does not have a protective effect 
from AIDS mortality among male and female youth.
CONCLUSION: Given the gendered difference in AIDS mortality among youth with 
secondary education, efforts to increase secondary education among males and 
further research into other factors exacerbating AIDS mortality among females 
with secondary education is needed in the country.

Contexte : La prévalence du VIH/sida est plus élevé chez les femmes que chez les 
hommes en Afrique subsaharienne. L'éducation est associé à de meilleurs 
résultats pour la santé. Pour cette raison et pour d'autres, les pays africains 
ont fait des efforts concertés pour accroître les taux d'éducation des jeunes. 
Toutefois, en Afrique du Sud les mâles ont des taux d'enseignement secondaire 
inférieur que chez les femmes, mais les femmes ont une prévalence plus élevée du 
VIH/SIDA. Cette étude examine si une disparité entre les sexes existe dans les 
taux de mortalité due au sida chez les jeunes à l'enseignement secondaire en 
Afrique du Sud. Méthodes : Cette étude utilise la table de statistiques 
descriptives et techniques. Un échantillon de 4 386 décès de jeunes de 
l'enseignement secondaire est utilisé. De l'échantillon total, 987 décès ont été 
chez les hommes et 340 chez les femmes ayant une éducation secondaire. Résultats 
: Cette étude montre que la mortalité due au SIDA est plus élevé chez les femmes 
que chez les hommes en Afrique du Sud. Les hommes et les femmes ayant 
l'enseignement secondaire inférieur ont la mortalité due au sida de tous les 
hommes et les femmes dans la population, mais les taux sont plus élevés pour les 
femmes. En utilisant les tables de survie d'une cause, la probabilité de mourir 
des jeunes contre le VIH/SIDA semble disparaître pour les hommes et les femmes. 
Rapport de cotes les calculs montrent que l'enseignement secondaire n'a pas un 
effet protecteur de la mortalité due au sida chez les garçons et les jeunes 
filles. Conclusion : étant donné la différence de genre dans la mortalité due au 
sida chez les jeunes à l'enseignement secondaire, les efforts visant à accroître 
l'éducation postsecondaire chez les hommes et de nouvelles recherches sur 
d'autres facteurs aggravant la mortalité due au sida chez les femmes ayant une 
éducation secondaire est nécessaire dans le pays.

Post-remediation use of macrophytes as composting materials for sustainable 
management of a sanitary landfill.

Author information:

National University , Jeju , Korea.

To increase the remediation ability and life expectancy of a leachate channel in 
a sanitary landfill, the plants used for remediation were composted as a 
post-remediation management technique. Phragmites australis or Typha 
angustifolia used for phytoremediation in a landfill leachate channel was 
harvested and used as a co-composting material with sewage sludge. The 
macrophyte compost was applied to the slope of a landfill on which plants were 
introduced for revegetation and to plants grown in pots to test for acute 
effects of the compost. The compost of the macrophytes successfully increased 
soil moisture and nutrient contents both on the landfill slope and in the soil 
of the pot experiment. Additionally, the rates of photosynthesis and the 
nutrient contents increased for plants grown in macrophyte compost. Thus, the 
revegetation or restoration management of the landfill would improve with the 
macrophyte compost used as a soil conditioner. The harvest of the macrophytes 
has the additional benefit of improving the remediation function of the leachate 
channel. Therefore, to sustainably manage both the leachate channel and the 
landfill, the composting of post-remediation macrophytes is an environmentally 
friendly and economically affordable method.

University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California (GBC, CT); and Doheny 
Eye Institute, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 
(JAI).

PURPOSE: To report a case of persistent epithelial defects in a patient with 
ocular chronic graft-versus-host disease that required coordinated modulation of 
systemic immunosuppressive treatment and overnight wear of Prosthetic 
Replacement of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (BostonSight PROSE, Needham, MA) 
devices to achieve ocular surface healing.
CASE REPORT: The case of a 38-year-old male patient who presented with a 2-year 
history of ocular chronic graft-versus-host disease, ocular burning, pain, light 
sensitivity, and a 3-week history of bilateral corneal epithelial defects is 
presented. Standard therapies and an initial PROSE treatment utilizing 
customized scleral lenses were unsuccessful in resolving his ocular 
complications. A second trial of PROSE treatment involving overnight wear of the 
devices in combination with increased systemic immunosuppressant therapy 
ultimately allowed ocular surface healing and improved his discomfort, vision, 
and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Sight-threatening complications of ocular chronic graft-versus-host 
disease often require a multidisciplinary approach. Persistent corneal 
epithelial defects may require increased systemic immunosuppression and 
extension of PROSE treatment to overnight wear.

Cavernous segment internal carotid artery (CSICA) injury during endoscopic 
transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary tumor is rare but fatal. The aim of this 
study is to investigate anatomical relationship between pituitary macroadenoma 
and corresponding CSICA using quantitative means with a sense to improve safety 
of surgery.In this retrospective study, a total of 98 patients with 
nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal 
surgeries were enrolled from 2005 to 2014. Intercarotid distances between 
bilateral CSICAs were measured in the 4 coronal levels, namely optic strut, 
convexity of carotid prominence, median sella turcica, and dorsum sellae. 
Parasellar extension was graded and recorded by Knosp-Steiner classification.Our 
findings indicated a linear relationship between size of pituitary macroadenoma 
and intercarotid distance over CSICA. The correlation was absent in pituitary 
macroadenoma with Knosp-Steiner grade 4 parasellar extension.Bigger pituitary 
macroadenoma makes more lateral deviation of CSICA. While facing larger tumor, 
sufficient bony graft is indicated for increasing surgical field, working area 
and operative safety.

University, Standford, CA Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI.

BACKGROUND: New direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has dramatically increased 
cure rates for patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), but has also 
substantially raised treatment costs.
AIM: The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the therapeutic benefit and net 
costs (i.e. efficiency frontier) and the quality-adjusted cost of care 
associated with the evolution of treatment regimens for patients with HCV 
genotype 1 in the United States.
DESIGN: A decision-analytic Markov model.
DATA SOURCE: Published literature and clinical trial data.
TIME HORIZON: Life Time.
PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer.
INTERVENTION: This study compared four approved regimens in treatment-naïve 
genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C patients, including pegylated interferon and 
ribavirin (PR), first generation triple therapy (boceprevir + PR and 
telaprevir + PR), second generation triple therapy (sofosbuvir + PR and 
simeprevir + PR) and all-oral DAA regimens (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and 
ombitasvir + paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir ± ribavirin).
OUTCOME MEASURE: Quality-adjusted cost of care (QACC). QACC was defined as the 
increase in treatment cost minus the increase in the patient's quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) when valued at $50,000 per QALY.
RESULTS: All-oral therapy improved the average sustained virologic response 
(SVR) rate to 96%, thereby offsetting the high drug acquisition cost of $85,714, 
which resulted in the highest benefit based on the efficiency frontier. 
Furthermore, while oral therapies increased HCV drug costs by $48,350, 
associated QALY gains decreased quality-adjusted cost of care by $14,120 
compared to dual therapy. When the value of a QALY was varied from $100,000 to 
$300,000, the quality adjusted cost of care compared to dual therapy ranged from 
- $21,234 to - $107,861, - $89,007 to - $293,130, - $176,280 to - $500,599 for 
first generation triple, second generation triple, and all-oral therapies, 
respectively. Primary efficacy and safety measurements for drug regimens were 
sourced from clinical trials data rather than a real-world setting. Factors such 
as individual demographic characteristics, comorbidities and alcohol consumption 
of the individual patients treated may alter disease progression but were not 
captured in this analysis.
CONCLUSION: New DAA treatments provide short-term and long-term clinical and 
economic value to society.

Structural basis for the transcriptional repressor NicR2 in nicotine degradation 
from Pseudomonas.

Republic of China.

Nicotine is an environmental toxicant in tobacco wastes, imposing severe hazards 
for the health of human and other mammalians. NicR2, a TetR-like repressor from 
Pseudomonas putida S16, plays a critical role in regulating nicotine 
degradation. Here, we determined the crystal structures of NicR2 and its complex 
with the inducer 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-pyridine (HSP). The N-terminal domain of 
NicR2 contains a conserved helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motif, while the 
C-terminal domain contains a cleft for its selective recognition for HSP. 
Residues R91, Y114 and Q118 of NicR2 form hydrogen bonds with HSP, their 
indispensable roles in NicR2's recognition with HSP were confirmed by 
structure-based mutagenesis combined with isothermal titration calorimetry 
analysis. Based on sequence alignment and structure comparison, Tyr67, Tyr68 and 
Lys72 of HTH motif were corroborated to take the major responsibility for 
DNA-binding using site-directed mutants. The 30-residue N-terminal extension of 
NicR2, especially residues 21-30 in the TFR arm, is required for the association 
with the operator DNA. Finally, we proposed that either NicR2 or the DNA would 
undergo a conformational change upon their association. Altogether, our 
structural and biochemical investigations unravel how NicR2 selectively 
recognizes HSP and DNA, and provide new insights into the TetR family of 
repressors.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative extension deficits following anterior cruciate 
ligament (ACL) reconstruction can cause major limitation during daily life. The 
purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of an all-arthroscopic 
approach and posterior capsule release for the treatment of persistent knee 
extension deficits following ACL reconstruction.
METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013 a total of 10 patients with knee flexion 
contractures after ACL reconstruction were assessed following an 
all-arthroscopic approach and posterior capsulotomy. The clinical outcomes were 
reviewed using the range of motion (ROM), Tegner Activity Level, Lysholm score 
and visual analogue pain scale (VAS).
RESULTS: Four women and six men with a median age of 34years (range: 17 to 
49years) were included in the study. The median follow-up period was 25months 
(range: 14 to 69months). The median preoperative extension deficit was 15° 
(range: 10 to 20°) compared to the normal contralateral knee. Postoperatively at 
final follow-up the median extension deficit was one degree (range: 0 to five 
degrees) (P<0.01). The median preoperative Lysholm score improved from 52 
(range: 32 to 67) to 92 (range: 84 to 100) postoperatively (P<0.01), while the 
median Tegner Activity Level improved from three (range: two to six) to six 
(range: three to seven) respectively (P<0.02). The median VAS status for pain 
decreased from five (range: one to 10) to one (range: 0 to three) (P<0.01). No 
complications were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic posterior capsulotomy is a safe and effective 
additional procedure in the treatment of persistent knee extension deficits
