BACKGROUND: The delivery of post stroke care is fragmented even in advanced 
public healthcare systems, globally. Primary care teams are entrusted to provide 
longer term care for stroke survivors in most developing countries. The 
integrated Care Pathway for Post Stroke patients (iCaPPS©) was designed to guide 
primary care teams to incorporate further rehabilitation and regular screening 
for post stroke complications among patients residing at home in communities, 
using the shared-care approach, especially in areas with limited access to 
specialist stroke care services. The iCaPPS© addressed coordination of 
rehabilitation and screening for post stroke complications which were absent in 
the current conventional care of patients managed at public primary care 
healthcentres. This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness and impact of 
iCaPPS© on quality-adjusted- life-years (QALY) compared with current 
conventional monitoring at public primary care healthcentres.
METHODS: A pragmatic healthcentre-based cluster randomised controlled 
trial-within trial on 151 post stroke patients from 10 public primary care 
facilities in Peninsular Malaysia was conducted to evaluate QALY of patients 
managed with iCaPPS© (n = 86) vs conventional care (n = 65) for 6 months. Costs 
from societal perspective were calculated, using combination of top down and 
activity-based costing methods. The 5-level EQ5D (EQ-5D-5 L) was used to 
calculate health state utility scores. Cost per QALY and incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (ICER) were determined. Differences within groups were 
determined using Mann-Whitney tests.
RESULTS: Total costs for 6 months treatment with iCaPPS© was MYR790.34, while 
conventional care cost MYR527.22. Median QALY for iCaPPS© was 0.55 (0,1.65) 
compared to conventional care 0.32 (0, 0.73) (z = - 0.21, p = 0.84). Cost per 
QALY for iCaPPS© was MYR1436.98, conventional care was MYR1647.56. The ICER was 
MYR1144.00, equivalent to 3.7% of per capita GDP (2012 prices).
CONCLUSIONS: Management of post stroke patients in the community using iCaPPS© 
costs less per QALY compared to current conventional care and is very cost 
effective.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) plays an important role in 
regulating a wide range of genomic processes. The sensitive and accurate 
detection of cellular TdT activity, particularly at the single-cell level, is 
highly significant for leukemia-associated biomedical and biological studies. 
Nevertheless, owing to the limited sensitivity of the existing TdT assays, the 
quantification of TdT activity at the single-cell level remains a big challenge. 
Herein, a simple but ultrasensitive method for assaying TdT activity is proposed 
based on terminal extension actuated loop-mediated isothermal amplification 
(TEA-LAMP). By using the TdT-induced extension product as an actuator, TdT 
activity is amplified twice by terminal extension and LAMP in an exponential 
manner and finally converted to a remarkably amplified fluorescent signal. In 
this study, as low as 2 × 10-8 U/μL TdT can be clearly detectable with the 
elegant TEA-LAMP strategy. Such an ultrahigh sensitivity enables the direct 
determination of TdT activity in individual single cells. In the meantime, by 
employing TdT as a co-factor, this strategy can also be applied to detecting 
other enzymes that can catalyze the DNA terminal hydroxylation. This work not 
only reports the up-to-now most sensitive TdT detection strategy at a 
single-cell level but also opens the new gate for versatile enzyme activity 
detection.

Ovarian cancer imposes a substantial health and economic burden. We 
systematically reviewed current health-economic evidence for ovarian cancer 
early detection or prevention strategies. Accordingly, we searched relevant 
databases for cost-effectiveness studies evaluating ovarian cancer early 
detection or prevention strategies. Study characteristics and results including 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICER) were summarized in standardized evidence tables. Economic results were 
transformed into 2017 Euros. The included studies (N = 33) evaluated ovarian 
cancer screening, risk-reducing interventions in women with heterogeneous cancer 
risks and genetic testing followed by risk-reducing interventions for mutation 
carriers. Multimodal screening with a risk-adjusted algorithm in postmenopausal 
women achieved ICERs of 9,800-81,400 Euros/QALY, depending on assumptions on 
mortality data extrapolation, costs, test performance, and screening frequency. 
Cost-effectiveness of risk-reducing surgery in mutation carriers ranged from 
cost-saving to 59,000 Euros/QALY. Genetic testing plus risk-reducing 
interventions for mutation carriers ranged from cost-saving to 54,000 Euros/QALY 
in women at increased mutation risk. Our findings suggest that preventive 
surgery and genetic testing plus preventive surgery in women at high risk for 
ovarian cancer can be considered effective and cost-effective. In postmenopausal 
women from the general population, multimodal screening using a risk-adjusted 
algorithm may be cost-effective.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), also known as type IV Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome, is a rare inherited connective tissue disease that affects 1 in 50,000 
to 250,000 individuals. It is characterized by catastrophic vascular 
complications and hollow viscus rupture; 80% of patients with vEDS experience a 
vascular complication by the age of 40 years, and median life expectancy is 40 
to 50 years. The central vasculature and visceral vasculature are most commonly 
affected; peripheral involvement is much less common. We describe the case of a 
40-year-old woman with vEDS previously complicated by ruptured splenic and 
posterior tibial artery aneurysms who presented with a ruptured left ulnar 
artery aneurysm resulting in compartment syndrome.

PURPOSE: New RT techniques and data emerging from follow-up for several tumor 
sites suggest that treatment volume de-escalation may permit to minimize 
therapy-related side effects and/or obtain better clinical outcomes. Here, we 
summarize the main evidence about volume de-escalation in RT.
METHOD: The relevant literature from PubMed was reviewed in this article. The 
ClinicalTrials.gov database was searched for clinical trials related to the 
specific topic.
RESULTS: In Lymphoma, large-volume techniques (extended- and involved-field RT) 
are being successfully replaced by involved-site RT and involved-node RT. In 
head and neck carcinoma, spare a part of elective neck is controversial. In 
early breast cancer, partial breast irradiation has been established as a 
treatment option in low-risk patients. In pancreatic cancer stereotactic body 
radiotherapy may be used to dose escalation. Stereotactic radiosurgery should be 
the treatment choice for patients with oligometastatic brain disease and a life 
expectancy of more than 3 months, and it should be considered an alternative to 
WBRT for patients with multiple brain metastases.
CONCLUSION: Further clinical trials are necessary to improve the identification 
of suitable patient cohorts and the extent of possible volume de-escalation that 
does not compromise tumor control.

Signaling lymphocyte activation family 7 (SLAMF7/CS1) is a cell surface 
glycoprotein that is highly expressed in multiple myeloma cells. CS1 is a 
sensitive and specific biomarker for multiple myeloma. CAR-T cell immunotherapy 
is a new method for the treatment of multiple myeloma. CS1 CAR-T cell 
immunotherapy has good effect on relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. To detect 
the expression efficiency of CS1 CAR on CS1 CAR-T cells and to find an auxiliary 
means to CAR-T cell immunotherapy, we prepared a CS1-Fc fusion protein. First, 
the extracellular domain of CS1 was amplified from the existing plasmid by PCR 
and ligated with human IgG1-Fc fragment by overlap extension PCR. The 
recombinant fragment was ligated into pMH3 eukaryotic expression vector. After 
restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing, the pMH3-CS1-Fc-his recombinant 
plasmid was successfully constructed. The recombinant plasmid was transfected 
into Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO-S) by liposome. The expression of the 
CS1-Fc fusion protein in CHO-S cells was identified by flow cytometry after G418 
pressure screening. Next, the CS1-Fc fusion protein was purified by nickel 
column. Western-blot analysis showed that molecular weight of the fusion protein 
was about 70 kDa was identified by Western blotting. The CS1-Fc fusion protein 
couldeffectively detect the expression rate of CS1 CAR and promote the 
activation, proliferation andcytokines secretion of the CS1 CAR-T cells. The 
results will lay the experimental foundation for the in vitro detection and 
potentiation of CAR-T cells in multiple myeloma treated with CS1 CAR-T cell.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To illustrate the frequency and trends of the comorbidity of 
epilepsy and dementia and the effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on cognitive 
functions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although the mortality and incidence of epilepsy are decreasing 
overall, they are increasing in the elderly as a result of population growth and 
increased life expectancy. Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are among the 
commonest causes of seizures and epilepsy. Epilepsy can be also complicated by 
cognitive impairment, suggesting a bidirectional association. Although epilepsy 
with onset in the elderly can be the manifestation of a CNS disease/injury, the 
cause of cognitive impairment is multifactorial and includes static (genetic 
background, age at seizure onset, developmental and acquired cerebral lesions) 
and dynamic factors [recurrent seizures, epileptiform discharges, type and 
number of AEDs and psychiatric comorbidities]. Most AEDs, with special reference 
to first-generation drugs, have negative effects on cognitive functions; 
however, none was found to increase the risk of dementia.
SUMMARY: A net increase in the burden of epilepsy, dementia and 
epilepsy-dementia comorbidity is expected. The growing use of second-generation 
AEDs might help reducing adverse cognitive effects. However, the fairly high 
cost of these drugs might delay their widespread use in resource-poor countries.

Antimicrobials have been known for millennia, but innovative antibiotics are 
currently in short supply. New antimicrobial discoveries are being threatened by 
planetary scale loss of biodiversity that has important impacts on species and 
ecosystems. This expert review underscores that microorganisms in nature and 
their diversity are essential cornerstones to revitalize the antibiotic 
innovation and discovery pipeline. The recent rise of systems ecology and 
planetary health offers new and actionable potentials in this regard. Without a 
systems scale focus and appreciation of systems ecology, the global threats to 
human and planetary health from inappropriate use of antibiotics and 
antimicrobial resistance will continue to escalate with serious consequences to 
all life on the planet. With acutely pressing research and development needs to 
revitalize antibiotic treatment and novel diagnostic tools for personalized 
medicine, national health systems ought to work across knowledge silos not only 
within but also across the ministries, for example, health, agriculture, 
environment, economy, trade, and social services ministries that collectively 
impact on systems ecology and by extension on health innovations including the 
antibiotic discovery pipeline. Such systems vision can also help to revitalize 
antibiotic discovery pipeline as most antibiotics have natural origins or have 
designs inspired or based on molecules in the environment and microorganisms 
that produce antibiotics. Above all, our audience and responsibility include 
every person who has an interest in his or her own health, in the health of his 
or her fellow human beings and all life on the planet, and in the health of 
future generations.

Background Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a local cancer treatment based on 
electroporation where the electric field is used to enhance cell membrane 
permeability and thereby facilitating the transition of chemotherapeutic agents 
into the cell. For the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer, a standard dosage 
of 15,000 IU/m2 bleomycin (BLM) is used. The aim of the present study was to 
evaluate the long-term ECT response in the group of elderly patients with 
non-melanoma skin cancer treated with a reduced dose of BLM in comparison to the 
outcome in the patients treated with the standard dose of BLM. Patients and 
methods Twenty-eight patients older than 65 years, with a total of 52 
non-melanoma skin lesions were included in the study. Twelve patients (24 
lesions) in the experimental group received a reduced dose of BLM (10,000 
IU/m2), 16 patients (28 lesions) were treated with a standard dose of BLM 
(15,000 IU/m2). Results No statistically significant difference in tumor control 
was observed between both groups. In the experimental group, tumors recurred in 
39.0% of treated lesions in a median follow-up time of 28 months. In the control 
group, the recurrence rate of treated lesions was 15.4% in a median follow-up 
time of 40 months. Conclusions ECT with a reduced dose of BLM is a feasible 
treatment option for elderly patients with equal efficacy to standard dose 
treatment and should be considered as a treatment modality in advanced aged 
patients with comorbidities, where overall life expectancy is poor.

IMPORTANCE: The optimal conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 
remain controversial in multivessel coronary artery disease.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term clinical outcomes of total arterial 
revascularization (TAR) vs non-TAR (CABG with at least 1 arterial and 1 
saphenous vein graft) in a multicenter population-based study.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter population-based cohort 
study using propensity score matching took place from October 2008 to March 2017 
in Ontario, Canada, with a mean and maximum follow-up of 4.6 and 9.0 years, 
respectively. Individuals with primary isolated CABG were identified, with at 
least 1 arterial graft. Exclusion criteria were individuals from out of province 
and younger than 18 years. Patients undergoing a cardiac reoperation or those in 
cardiogenic shock were also excluded because these conditions would potentially 
bias the surgeon toward not performing TAR. Analysis began April 2019.
EXPOSURES: Total arterial revascularization.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was time to first event of a 
composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeated revascularization 
(major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events). Secondary outcomes included 
the individual components of the primary outcome.
RESULTS: Of 49 404 individuals with primary isolated CABG, 2433 (4.9%) received 
TAR, with the total number of bypasses being 2, 3, and 4 or more vessels in 1521 
(62.5%), 865 (35.6%), and 47 individuals (1.9%), respectively. The mean (SD) age 
was 61.2 (10.4) years and 1983 (81.5%) were men. After propensity score 
matching, 2132 patient pairs were formed, with equal total number of bypasses 
(mean [SD], 2.4 [0.5]) but with more arterial grafts in the TAR group (mean 
[SD], 2.4 [0.5] vs 1.2 [0.4]; P < .01). In-hospital death (15 [0.7%] vs 21 
[1.0%]; P = .32) did not differ between TAR vs non-TAR groups after propensity 
score matching. Throughout 8 years, TAR was associated with improved freedom 
from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% 
CI, 0.68-0.89), death (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.97), and myocardial 
infarction (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.92). There was no difference in 
stroke and repeated revascularization.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Total arterial revascularization was associated with 
improved long-term freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular 
events, death, and myocardial infarction and may be the procedure of choice for 
patients with reasonable life expectancy requiring CABG.

Uric acid is a common metabolite found in mammals' serum. Recently, several 
metabolites have been identified that modulate aging, and uric acid levels are 
positively correlated with mammals' lifespan. However, the molecular mechanisms 
underlying this are largely undefined. Here we show that uric acid, an end 
product of purine metabolism, enhances the resistance of oxidative stress and 
extends the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). We show that uric 
acid enhances a variety of pathways and leads to the upregulation of genes that 
are required for uric acid-mediated life span extension. We find that the 
transcription factors DAF-16/FOXO, SKN-1/NRF2 and HSF-1 contribute to the 
beneficial longevity conferred by uric acid. We also show that uric acid induced 
life span extension by regulating the reproductive signaling and insulin/IGF-1 
signaling (IIS) pathways. In addition, we find that mitochondrial function plays 
an important role in uric acid-mediated life span extension. Taken together, 
these data suggest that uric acid prolongs the life span of C. elegans, in part, 
because of its antioxidative activity, which in turn regulates the IIS and the 
reproductive signaling pathways, thereby activating the function of the 
transcription factors DAF-16, HSF-1 and SKN-1.

Maintaining dental and oral health and increasing healthy life expectancy are 
important issues for Japan as it deals with the rapid aging of its population. 
The purpose of this study was to determine effective dental health measures 
aimed at increasing the number of present teeth in the elderly. Change in the 
number of present teeth was determined based on data obtained from the 2009 and 
2014 "Good Teeth Tokyo (Ii-ha Tokyo)" surveys carried out by the Tokyo 
Metropolitan Government. The number of present teeth and percentile curves were 
compared between these two time points. The number only showed a significant 
increase in individuals aged 60 years in 2014 (p<0.05). This may have been due 
to the establishment of a national public insurance system. The number of 
present teeth showed an increase in 2014 in the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile 
curves. In the 75th and 90th percentile curves, tooth loss accelerated when the 
number of present teeth was fewer than 25. This finding is consistent with 
studies reporting that tooth loss itself is a risk for tooth loss. Tooth loss 
showed a slight acceleration between the ages of approximately 20 and 45 years 
in the 90th percentile curve. These results indicate that dental check-ups at 
universities and companies, periodontal disease check-ups performed by local 
governments, and health instruction at these check-ups are necessary to increase 
the number of present teeth in the elderly. They further suggest that 
implementing measures to promote periodic visits to dental clinics and providing 
incentives to undergo treatment for tooth defects are necessary in high-risk 
individuals. In conclusion, dental check-ups, health instruction, and strategies 
for high-risk individuals in their 20s and 40s are necessary to increase the 
number of present teeth in the elderly.

Objective: To analyze the long-term trend of mortality and years of life lost 
(YLL) of gastric cancer in Tianjin from 1999 to 2015. Methods: From January 1, 
1999 to December 31, 2015, the data of gastric cancer deaths was collected from 
the Tianjin death surveillance system. The inclusion criteria of death due to 
gastric cancer were coded by using 151 in the 9(th) edition of the international 
classification of diseases (ICD) (1999-2002) and C16 in the 10(th) edition of 
ICD (2003-2015). The crude and age-standardized mortality rate (ASR) of gastric 
cancer was calculated according to Segi's world standard population. YLL was 
calculated according to the standard method of the disease burden of WHO. The 
Joinpoint regression was used to calculate the average annual percentage change 
(AAPC) to indicate the trend of mortality and YLL of gastric cancer. Results: 
From 1999 to 2015, there were 20 000 deaths of gastric cancer in Tianjin. The 
proportion of gastric cancer death in the population aged 0-44 years old, 45-64 
years old, and 65 years old and above was 4.9%, 30.4%, and 64.8%, respectively. 
The proportion of males and urban was 67.1% and 67.5%, respectively. From 1999 
to 2015, the crude mortality rate was from 12.10/100 000 to 12.58/100 000. The 
ASR was from 11.04/100 000 to 7.24/100 000. The average annual YLL number was 29 
625.83 person-years and the rate was 3.09 person-years per thousand people. From 
1999 to 2015, the crude mortality rate and the PYLL of gastric cancer in Tianjin 
were stable (the AAPC was 0.34% and -0.24%, all P values >0.05). The ASR showed 
a downward trend (AAPC=-2.58%, P<0.001). Conclusion: From 1999 to 2015, the ASR 
of gastric cancer in Tianjin showed a downward trend, and the YLL of gastric 
cancer was stable.

BACKGROUND: Dialysis treatment is improving, but several long-term problems 
remain unsolved, including metabolic bone disease linked to chronic kidney 
disease (CKD-MBD). The availability of new, efficacious but expensive drugs 
(intravenous calcimimetic agents) poses ethical problems, especially in the 
setting of budget limitations.
METHODS: Reasons of choice, side effects, biochemical trends were discussed in a 
cohort of 15 patients (13% of the dialysis population) who stared treatment with 
intravenous calcimimetics in a single center. All patients had previously been 
treated with oral calcimimetic agents; dialysis efficacy was at target in 14/15; 
hemodiafiltration was employed in 10/15. Median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 
8. The indications were discussed according to the principlist ethics 
(beneficience, non maleficience, justice and autonomy). Biochemical results were 
analyzed to support the clinical-ethical choices.
RESULTS: In the context of a strict clinical and biochemical surveillance, the 
lack of side effects ensured "non-maleficence"; efficacy was at least similar to 
oral calcimimetic agents, but tolerance was better. Autonomy was respected 
through a shared decision-making model; all patients appreciated the reduction 
of the drug burden, and most acknowledged better control of their biochemical 
data. The ethical conflict resides in the balance between the clinical 
"beneficience, non-maleficience" advantage and "justice" (economic impact of 
treatment, potentially in attrition with other resources, since the drug is 
expensive and included in the dialysis bundle). The dilemma is more relevant 
when a patient's life expectancy is short (economic impact without clear 
clinical advantages), or when non-compliance is an issue (unclear advantage if 
the whole treatment is not correctly taken).
CONCLUSIONS: In a context of person-centered medicine, autonomy, beneficence and 
non-maleficence should weight more than economic justice. While ethical 
discussions are not aimed at finding "the right answer" but asking "the right 
questions", this example can raise awareness of the importance of including an 
ethical analysis in the choice of "economically relevant" drugs.

BACKGROUND: China has more than 18% of the global population and over 770 
million workers. However, the burden of disease attributable to occupational 
risks is unavailable in China. We aimed to estimate the burden of disease 
attributable to occupational exposures at provincial levels from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: We estimated the summary exposure values (SEVs), deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to occupational risk factors 
in China from 1990 to 2017, based on Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2017. 
There were 18 occupational risks, 22 related causes, and 35 risk-outcome pairs 
included in this study. Meanwhile, we compared age-standardized death rates 
attributable to occupational risk factors in provinces of China by 
socio-demographic index (SDI).
RESULTS: The SEVs of most occupational risks increased from 1990 to 2017. There 
were 323,833 (95% UI 283,780 - 369,061) deaths and 14,060,210 (12,022,974 - 
16,125,763) DALYs attributable to total occupational risks in China, which were 
27.9 and 22.1% of corresponding global levels, respectively. For attributable 
deaths, major risks came from occupational particulate matter, gases, and fumes 
(PGFs), and for the attributable DALYs, from occupational injuries. The 
attributable burden was higher in males than in females. Compared with high SDI 
provinces, low SDI provinces, especially Western China, had higher death rates 
attributable to total occupational risks, occupational PGFs, and occupational 
injuries.
CONCLUSION: Occupational risks contribute to a huge disease burden in China. The 
attributable burden is higher in males, and in less developed provinces of 
Western China, reflecting differences in risk exposure, socioeconomic 
conditions, and type of jobs. Our study highlights the need for further research 
and focused policy interventions on the health of workers especially for less 
developed provinces in China to reduce occupational health losses effectively.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the temporal and spatial trends of mortality and 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) due to chronic respiratory diseases, by 
age and sex, across the world during 1990-2017 using data from the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2017.
DESIGN: Systematic analysis.
DATA SOURCE: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2017.
METHODS: Mortality and DALYs from chronic respiratory diseases were estimated 
from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 using DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian 
meta-regression tool. The estimated annual percentage change of the age 
standardised mortality rate was calculated using a generalised linear model with 
a Gaussian distribution. Mortality and DALYs were stratified according to the 
Socio-demographic index. The strength and direction of the association between 
the Socio-demographic index and mortality rate were measured using the Spearman 
rank order correlation. Risk factors for chronic respiratory diseases were 
analysed from exposure data.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2017, the total number of deaths due to chronic 
respiratorydiseases increased by 18.0%, from 3.32 (95% uncertainty interval 3.01 
to 3.43) million in 1990 to 3.91 (3.79 to 4.04) million in 2017. The age 
standardised mortality rate of chronic respiratory diseases decreased by an 
average of 2.41% (2.28% to 2.55%) annually. During the 27 years, the annual 
decline in mortality rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 
2.36%, uncertainty interval 2.21% to 2.50%) and pneumoconiosis (2.56%, 2.44% to 
2.68%) has been slow, whereas the mortality rate for interstitial lung disease 
and pulmonary sarcoidosis (0.97%, 0.92% to 1.03%) has increased. Reductions in 
DALYs for asthma and pneumoconiosis have been seen, but DALYs due to COPD, and 
interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis have increased. Mortality 
and the annual change in mortality rate due to chronic respiratory diseases 
varied considerably across 195 countries. Assessment of the factors responsible 
for regional variations in mortality and DALYs and the unequal distribution of 
improvements during the 27 years showed negative correlations between the 
Socio-demographic index and the mortality rates of COPD, pneumoconiosis, and 
asthma. Regions with a low Socio-demographic index had the highest mortality and 
DALYs. Smoking remained the major risk factor for mortality due to COPD and 
asthma. Pollution from particulate matter was the major contributor to deaths 
from COPD in regions with a low Socio-demographic index. Since 2013, a high body 
mass index has become the principal risk factor for asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: Regions with a low Socio-demographic index had the greatest burden 
of disease. The estimated contribution of risk factors (such as smoking, 
environmental pollution, and a high body mass index) to mortality and DALYs 
supports the need for urgent efforts to reduce exposure to them.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the costs and outcomes associated with treating 
non-asthmatic adults (nor suffering from other lung-disease) presenting to 
primary care with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) with oral 
corticosteroids compared with placebo.
DESIGN: Cost-consequence analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial. 
Perspectives included the healthcare provider, patients and productivity losses 
associated with time off work.
SETTING: Fifty-four National Health Service (NHS) general practices in England.
PARTICIPANTS: 398 adults attending NHS primary practices with ALRTI but no 
asthma or other chronic lung disease, followed up for 28 days.
INTERVENTIONS: 2× 20 mg oral prednisolone per day for 5 days versus matching 
placebo tablets.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years using the 5-level EuroQol-5D 
version measured weekly; duration and severity of symptom. Direct and indirect 
resources related to the disease and its treatment were also collected. Outcomes 
were measured for the 28-day follow-up.
RESULTS: 198 (50%) patients received the intervention (prednisolone) and 200 
(50%) received placebo. NHS costs were dominated by primary care contacts, 
higher with placebo than with prednisolone (£13.11 vs £10.38) but without 
evidence of a difference (95% CI £3.05 to £8.52). The trial medication cost of 
£1.96 per patient would have been recouped in prescription charges of £4.30 per 
patient overall (55% participants would have paid £7.85), giving an overall mean 
'profit' to the NHS of £7.00 (95% CI £0.50 to £17.08) per patient. There was a 
quality adjusted life years gain of 0.03 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.05) equating to half 
a day of perfect health favouring the prednisolone patients; there was no 
difference in duration of cough or severity of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of prednisolone for non-asthmatic adults with ALRTI, 
provided small gains in quality of life and cost savings driven by prescription 
charges. Considering the results of the economic evaluation and possible side 
effects of corticosteroids, the short-term benefits may not outweigh the 
long-term harms.

OBJECTIVES: To enhance adherence to cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a patient 
education programme called 'learning and coping' (LC-programme) was implemented 
in three hospitals in Denmark. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
cost-utility of the LC-programme compared with the standard CR-programme.
METHODS: 825 patients with ischaemic heart disease or heart failure were 
randomised to the LC-programme or the standard CR-programme and were followed 
for 3 years.A societal cost perspective was applied and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALY) were based on SF-6D measurements. Multiple imputation technique was 
used to handle missing data on the SF-6D. The statistical analyses were based on
