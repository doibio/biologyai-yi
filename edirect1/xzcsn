The red palm mite, Raoiella indica Hirst, is a threat to coconut, banana and 
native Arecaceae and Heliconiaceae in Brazil. This mite originated in the 
Eastern Hemisphere and was first reported in 2004 in the Americas, where the 
pest is spreading quickly and causing severe damage to its host plants. The 
objective of this work was to determine the life-history parameters of R. indica 
at constant temperatures, estimate its thermal requirements [threshold 
temperature (Tb) and thermal constant (K)] and also compare its life table 
parameters between sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis. The life tables were 
constructed on leaflets of Adonidia merrillii at 15, 20, 24, 27, 30 and 34 °C 
and 65% RH and a 12-h photoperiod. The longevity and the number of laid eggs of 
non-copulated adult females were evaluated at 27 °C. Raoiella indica had 
complete development, from egg to adult, only at 20, 24, 27 and 30 °C. At 15 °C, 
the eggs did not hatch, and at 34 °C, the mites survived only until the larval 
stage. For sexual reproduction, the optimal temperature was 27 °C, under which 
the reproductive parameters were higher. The reproductive parameters for sexual 
reproduction were higher than those for parthenogenesis. The Tb was 14.79 °C, 
and the thermal constant was 208.33 degree days. The life parameters estimated 
in this study can be used for modelling and predicting the population growth of 
R. indica in the field and consequently for improving their management 
strategies.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence has shown that online surveys can 
reliably collect preference data, which markedly decrease the cost of health 
preference studies and expand their representativeness. As the use of mobile 
technology continues to grow, we wanted to examine its potential impact on 
health preferences.
METHODS: Two recently completed discrete choice experiments using members of the 
US general population (n = 15,292) included information on respondent device 
(cell phone, tablet, Mac, PC) and internet connection (business, cellular, 
college, government, residential). In this analysis, we tested for differences 
in respondent characteristics, participation, response quality, and utility 
values for the 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) by device and connection.
RESULTS: Compared to Mac and PC users, respondents using a cell phone or tablet 
had longer completion times and were significantly more likely to drop out 
during the surveys (p < 0.001). Tablet users also demonstrated more logical 
inconsistencies (p = 0.05). Likewise, respondents using a cellular internet 
connection exhibit significantly less consistency in their health preferences. 
However, matched samples for tablets and cell phones produced similar EQ-5D-5L 
utility values (mean differences < 0.06 on a quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] 
scale for all potential health states).
CONCLUSION: Allowing respondents to complete online surveys using a cell phone 
or tablet or over a cellular connection substantially increases the diversity of 
respondents and the likelihood of obtaining a representative sample, as many 
individuals have cell phones but not a computer. While the results showed 
systematic variability in participation and response quality by device and 
connection type, this study did not show any meaningful changes in utility 
values.

As life expectancy for those with cystic fibrosis (CF) now exceeds 40 years of 
age, adult hospitals away from specialized CF services are being exposed more 
frequently to people with acute complications of CF. Well-known manifestations 
of CF include pulmonary disease and pancreatic insufficiency with malabsorption. 
However, a less well-known entity is distal intestinal obstruction syndrome 
(DIOS), which is an important cause of obstructive symptoms in people with CF 
that must be differentiated from other causes of bowel obstruction. However, one 
confounding factor is that adults with CF may have elements of both DIOS and 
mechanical bowel obstruction due to adhesions from previous operations. A recent 
tragic outcome in a young adult with CF highlights the need for all doctors, 
both junior and senior, especially those who are not directly involved in 
day-to-day CF care, to understand the features of DIOS and the appropriate 
management, which differs from that of a mechanical bowel obstruction. This 
review aims to highlight the clinical and pathophysiological features of DIOS, 
differentiate it from other causes of bowel obstruction and contrast management 
strategies. Improved knowledge of DIOS will help to facilitate appropriate 
recognition and permit optimal, multidisciplinary management of this CF 
complication.

Objective: We investigated the economic burden and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the 
Republic of Korea. Method: Using the National Health Insurance Service claims 
data for the population aged 19 years or younger, a prevalence-based approach 
was used to calculate the DALYs of ADHD. Direct medical costs, direct nonmedical 
costs, and indirect costs resulting from ADHD were estimated to calculate the 
economic burden of ADHD. Results: A total of 69,353 people in Korea were 
diagnosed with ADHD in 2012. The burden of ADHD as measured by the 
prevalence-based approach was 32,605 DALYs. The total economic burden of ADHD 
was US$47.55 million, which accounted for approximately 0.004% of Korean GDP 
(gross domestic product) in 2012. Conclusion: Our findings shed light on the 
considerable burden of ADHD, emphasizing the need for policies that can 
encourage ADHD treatment and enhance compliance.

Aims: Bone complications (also known as skeletal-related events [SREs]) pose 
significant health and financial burdens on patients with bone metastases. 
Denosumab demonstrated superiority over zoledronic acid in delaying the time to 
first SRE. This study examined the lifetime cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs 
zoledronic acid from both US payer and societal perspectives.Methods: This 
analysis used a lifetime Markov model and included patients with breast cancer, 
prostate cancer, and other solid tumors and bone metastases. The societal 
perspective included direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs 
associated with denosumab and zoledronic acid; the payer perspective included 
direct medical costs only. Bone complication rates for each tumor type were 
estimated from three pivotal phase 3 studies and modified to reflect real-world 
incidence.Results: From a societal perspective, compared with zoledronic acid, 
denosumab use resulted in an incremental cost of $9,043, an incremental benefit 
of 0.128 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), a lifetime cost per QALY of 
$70,730, and a net monetary benefit (NMB) of $10,135 in favor of denosumab. 
Direct drug costs for denosumab ($28,352) were higher than zoledronic 
acid/untreated ($578), but were offset by reduced costs associated with bone 
complications. From a payer perspective, denosumab use was associated with an 
incremental cost of $13,396, and an incremental benefit of 0.128 QALYs, for a 
cost of $104,778 per QALY and an NMB of $5,782 in favor of 
denosumab.Limitations: Some model inputs had limited information and, given that 
the results may be sensitive to changes in these inputs, our findings should be 
interpreted within the context of the data inputs and modeling assumptions used 
in the analysis.Conclusions: Denosumab is a cost-effective option to prevent 
bone complications in patients with solid tumors when considering both payer and 
broader societal perspectives.

Pulmonary hypertension due to interstitial lung disease.

King CS(1), Nathan SD.

Author information:
(1)Inova Fairfax Advanced Lung Disease and Transplant Clinic, Falls Church, 
Virginia, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pulmonary hypertension has been reported to complicate the 
course of a number of fibrotic lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and nonspecific interstitial 
pneumonitis. Most commonly, mild elevations in the mean pulmonary artery 
pressure are seen in patients with advanced pulmonary fibrosis. However, some 
patients may develop severe pulmonary hypertension, which appears out of 
proportion to the degree of their restrictive lung disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: The benefits of pulmonary vasodilator therapy have yet to be 
established in pulmonary hypertension complicating fibrotic lung disease. In 
fact, one recent clinical trial examining riociguat in patients with pulmonary 
hypertension complicating idiopathic interstitial pneumonias was terminated 
early for an increased risk of death or hospitalization. Multiple clinical 
trials on this topic are currently ongoing, including studies examining inhaled 
pulmonary vasodilator therapies.
SUMMARY: The development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased 
exertional oxygen requirements, worsened functional capacity and attenuated life 
expectancy. It is hoped that continued research will find an effective therapy 
for this condition, which will improve quality of life and extend life 
expectancy in patients with this condition.

Advanced sarcoidosis.

Baughman RP(1), Wells A(2).

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, 
Ohio, USA.
(2)Royal Hospital Brompton, London, UK.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advanced sarcoidosis is an important cause of morbidity and 
mortality in sarcoidosis. Over the past few years, several studies have been 
published clarifying the prevalence and severity of this condition.
RECENT FINDINGS: Pulmonary involvement is the most common form of sarcoidosis. 
Increased morbidity and significant mortality is encountered in advanced lung 
disease. Although many sarcoidosis patients with pulmonary fibrosis have a 
normal life expectancy, at least 20% develop progression and may die from this 
complication. Sarcoidosis-associated pulmonary hypertension (SAPH) is an 
independent cause of death in advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis. Two large 
multicenter registries and a large single-center report provide more details 
regarding presentation and outcome of SAPH. Advanced neurologic disease is 
associated with significant morbidity, but not much mortality. Two large 
retrospective reviews demonstrated the effectiveness of infliximab in treating 
advanced neurosarcoidosis. Advanced cardiac sarcoidosis can lead to mortality.
SUMMARY: Advanced sarcoidosis is associated with significant morbidity and some 
mortality. Up to a quarter of all sarcoidosis patients have one or more forms of 
advanced disease. These patients require closer monitoring and often multiples 
treatments.

Death in cancer patients can be caused by the progression of tumors, their 
malignity, or other associated conditions such as sepsis, which is a multiphasic 
host response to a pathogen that can be significantly amplified by endogenous 
factors. Its incidence is continuously rising, which reflects the increasing 
number of sick patients at a higher risk of infection, especially those that are 
elderly, pediatric, or immunosuppressed. Sepsis appears to be directly 
associated with oncological treatment and fatal septic shock. Patients with a 
cancer diagnosis face a much higher risk of infections after being 
immunosuppressed by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or anti-inflammatory therapy, 
especially caused by non-pathogenic, Gram-negative, and multidrug-resistant 
pathogens. There is a notorious difference between the incidence and mortality 
rates related to sepsis in pediatric oncologic patients between developed and 
developing countries: they are much higher in developing countries, where 
investment for diagnosis and treatment resources, infrastructure, medical 
specialists, cancer-related control programs, and post-therapeutic care is 
insufficient. This situation not only limits but also reduces the life 
expectancy of treated pediatric oncologic patients, and demands higher costs 
from the healthcare systems. Therefore, efforts must aim to limit the 
progression of sepsis conditions, applying the most recommended therapeutic 
regimens as soon as the initial risk factors are clinically evident-or even 
before they are, as when taking advantage of machine learning prediction systems 
to analyze data.

OBJECTIVE: To review the literature regarding screening for vestibular 
schwannoma in the context of demographic changes leading to increasing numbers 
of elderly patients presenting with asymmetric auditory symptoms.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed, with narrative 
synthesis and statistical analysis of data where appropriate.
RESULTS: Vestibular schwannomas diagnosed in patients aged over 70 years exhibit 
slower growth patterns and tend to be of smaller size compared to those tumours 
in younger age groups. This fact, combined with reduced life expectancy, renders 
the probability of these tumours in the elderly requiring active treatment with 
surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy to be extremely low. Vestibular schwannomas 
in the elderly are much more likely to be managed by serial monitoring with 
magnetic resonance imaging. The weighted yield of magnetic resonance imaging in 
the diagnosis of vestibular schwannoma in all age groups is 1.18 per cent, with 
almost 85 scans required to diagnose 1 tumour.
CONCLUSION: An evidence-based approach to the investigation of asymmetric 
hearing loss and tinnitus in the elderly patient can be used to formulate 
guidelines for the rational use of magnetic resonance imaging in this 
population.

Historically, analysis of intragastric exfoliative cytology (IEC) of gastric 
cancer (GC) was used with a diagnostic intent only. With the successful advent 
of endoscopic biopsy, the rate of detection of GC has improved worldwide and, as 
a consequence, IEC has been progressively abandoned. Today, however, there is a 
renewed interest in this field of research, as witnessed by several pertinent 
publications. As discussed in this review, in fact, currently the importance of 
analyzing IEC in patients with early and advanced GC seems to reside in its 
clinicopathological and prognostic significance. In fact, compared to 
non-sloughing tumors, GC exhibiting intragastric exfoliation was recently 
associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype (characterized by deeper 
infiltration of the gastric wall, lymph nodal or distant metastases, 
angiolymphatic and perineural invasion) and poorer prognosis. Adoption of IEC 
examination in routine practice might help identify patients at higher risk of 
developing local recurrence and peritoneal metastasis from early and advanced 
GC, optimizing their treatment and improving quality of life and life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Despite improvements in cancer therapy, life expectancy after 
tumor recurrence remains low. Relapsed cancer is characterized by drug 
resistance, often mediated through overexpression of multidrug resistance (MDR) 
genes. Camellia sinensis non fermentatum extract is known for its anticancer 
properties in several cancer cell lines and might improve cancer therapy outcome 
after tumor recurrence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, alveolar 
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and primary rhabdomyosarcoma MAST139 cells were used 
to test NPE® effects on cell viability in combination with chemotherapeutic 
agents. Cell viability was measured by the WST-1 assay and CV staining. Gene 
expression levels of chemotherapy-induced efflux pumps and their activity was 
assessed upon NPE® treatment by measuring doxorubicin retention through 
evaluation of the autofluorescence signal.
RESULTS: Administration of increasing doxorubicin concentrations triggered 
immediate adaptation to the drug, which was surprisingly overcome by the 
addition of NPE®. Investigating the mechanism of immediate adaptation, MDR1 gene 
overexpression was observed upon doxorubicin treatment. Although NPE® did not 
alter pump gene expression, it was able to reduce pump activity, thus allowing 
the chemotherapeutic agent to stay inside the cells to exert its full anticancer 
activity.
CONCLUSION: NPE® might improve chemotherapeutic treatment by re-sensitizing 
relapsed tumors to anticancer drugs. Fighting MDR represents the key to overcome 
tumor relapse and improve the overall survival of cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION: Exercise therapy is the treatment of choice for the management of 
patients with shoulder subacromial pain. However, we do not know whether a 
tailored rehabilitation programme is more effective than a standardised 
strengthening programme. The aim of this feasibility trial is to assess: (1) 
participant recruitment rate, (2) the proportion of participants enrolled from 
the total number screened, (3) adherence to the rehabilitation programme, (4) 
drop-out rates, (5) obtain estimates of adverse reactions to treatment, (6) 
obtain estimates of intervention effects in order to inform the sample size of 
the fully-powered randomised controlled trial, (7) conduct a preliminary 
cost-effectiveness analysis of the standardised strengthening and the tailored 
rehabilitation interventions.
METHODS: The MAnagement of Subacromial disorders of The shouldER (MASTER) trial, 
is a two-arm, patient-blinded and assessor-blinded, randomised controlled 
feasibility trial. Participants will be randomly allocated into one of the 
interventions group: tailored or standardised rehabilitation. To obtain 
estimates of intervention effects, we will compare changes in pain and 
shoulder-related disability scores between the two intervention groups using a 
repeated mixed-model analysis of variance, with alpha set at 0.05, and power at 
80%. Since this is a feasibility study, we will not adjust alpha for multiple 
comparisons. To determine whether it is feasible to conduct the full trial, we 
will consider 75% CI as the probability threshold at 3-month follow-up.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the University of Otago 
Ethics Committee (Ref: H17/080). Findings from this study will be presented at 
national and international conferences, and will be submitted for publication in 
a peer-reviewed journal.

In view of the increasing life expectancy in different parts of the world, a 
larger proportion of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
requiring oncological treatment is expected. The clinicopathological 
characteristics of HCC in elderly patients and in younger patients are 
different. Elderly patients, in general, also have more comorbidities. 
Evaluation of the efficacy of different HCC treatment options in elderly 
patients is necessary to optimize treatment outcomes for them. Treatment 
modalities for HCC include hepatectomy, liver transplantation, radiofrequency 
ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, and molecular-targeted therapy with 
sorafenib. In this review, current evidence on the risks and outcomes of the 
different HCC treatments for elderly patients are discussed. According to data 
in the literature, elderly patients and younger patients benefited similarly 
from HCC treatments. More clinical data are needed for the determination of 
selecting criteria on elderly HCC patients to maximize their chance of getting 
the most appropriate and effective treatments. As such, further studies 
evaluating the outcomes of different HCC treatment modalities in elderly 
patients are warranted.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of cardiovascular disease and its subtypes on 
the premature mortality of Hispanics in the United States.
METHODS: We used national death records to identify deaths for the three largest 
Hispanic subgroups (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans) in the United States 
from 2003 to 2012 (N = 832,550). We identified all deaths from cardiovascular 
disease and by subtype (ie, ischemic, cerebrovascular, hypertensive and heart 
failure) using the underlying cause of death via ICD-10 codes. Years of 
potential life lost (YPLL) was calculated by age categories standardizing with 
the 2000 US Census population. Population estimates were calculated using linear 
interpolation from 2000 and 2010 US Census data.
RESULTS: After standardization, Puerto Ricans experienced the highest YPLL for 
all types of cardiovascular disease compared with Mexicans and Cubans (1,139 
years per 100,000 compared with 868 and 841, respectively), a disparity that 
remained consistent over the course of a decade. Among different subcategories 
of cardiovascular disease, Puerto Ricans had the highest YPLL for ischemic and 
hypertensive heart disease, while Mexicans had the highest YPLL from 
cerebrovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, disaggregation of Hispanic subgroups revealed marked 
heterogeneity in premature cardiovascular mortality. These findings suggest that 
measures to improve the cardiovascular health of Hispanics should incorporate 
subgroup status as a key part of public health strategy.

INTRODUCTION: Functional electrical stimulation uses clinician-set parameters to 
modify stimulation. This study aimed to investigate whether timing parameters in 
the ODFS Pace functional electrical stimulation device have an effect on the 
gait of the general population of functional electrical stimulation users who 
have a foot drop.
METHODS: Twelve functional electrical stimulation users with foot drop resulting 
from upper motor neurone disorders were recruited from the functional electrical 
stimulation Service in Leeds, UK. A crossover trial design was used, comparing 
adjusted values of rising ramp, delay and extension. Instrumented gait analysis 
was carried out to measure ankle dorsiflexion during the swing phase of gait, 
foot clearance from the ground, and speed of ankle plantarflexion at initial 
contact. The effect of timing parameters on gait kinematics was studied.
RESULTS: No statistically significant effects on the measured parts of gait were 
found for any of the timing parameters. Trends were identified in average 
mid-swing ground clearance and dorsiflexion associated with the delay and rising 
ramp timing parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Further work in this area should use larger numbers of 
participants. Based on these results, the effects of ramping and delay would be 
of particular interest for further study.

Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a challenging burden on public health. 
Therapeutic strategies for CHF have developed rapidly in the past decades from 
conventional medical therapy, which mainly includes administration of 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, 
beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, to biomedical engineering methods, 
which include interventional engineering, such as percutaneous balloon mitral 
valvotomy, percutaneous coronary intervention, catheter ablation, biventricular 
pacing or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and CRT-defibrillator use, and 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator use; mechanical engineering, such as left 
ventricular assistant device use, internal artery balloon counterpulsation, 
cardiac support device use, and total artificial heart implantation; surgical 
engineering, such as coronary artery bypass graft, valve replacement or repair 
of rheumatic or congenital heart diseases, and heart transplantation (HT); 
regenerate engineering, which includes gene therapy, stem cell transplantation, 
and tissue engineering; and rehabilitating engineering, which includes exercise 
training, low-salt diet, nursing, psychological interventions, health education, 
and external counterpulsation/enhanced external counterpulsation in the 
outpatient department. These biomedical engineering therapies have greatly 
improved the symptoms of CHF and life expectancy. To date, pharmacotherapy, 
which is based on evidence-based medicine, large-scale, multi-center, randomized 
controlled clinical trials, is still a major treatment option for CHF; the 
current interventional and mechanical device engineering treatment for advanced 
CHF is not enough owing to its individual status. In place of HT or the use of a 
total artificial heart, stem cell technology and gene therapy in regenerate 
engineering for CHF are very promising. However, each therapy has its advantages 
and disadvantages, and it is currently possible to select better therapeutic 
strategies for patients with CHF according to cost-efficacy analyses of these 
therapies. Taken together, we think that a new era of biomedical engineering for 
CHF has begun.

PURPOSE: Perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing strategies for 
selecting P2Y12 inhibitors in acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
METHODS: Six strategies for selection of P2Y12 inhibitors in ACS were compared 
from the US healthcare system perspective: (1) clopidogrel for all (universal 
clopidogrel); (2) ticagrelor guided by platelet reactivity assay (PRA; 
clopidogrel + phenotype); (3) ticagrelor use only in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers 
(genotype + conservative ticagrelor); (4) ticagrelor use in both CYP2C19 
intermediate and poor metabolizers (genotype + liberal ticagrelor); (5) 
ticagrelor use only in patients with CYP2C19 polymorphisms and clopidogrel 
nonresponse by PRA (genotype + phenotype); and (6) ticagrelor for all (universal 
ticagrelor). A decision model was developed to model major adverse 
cardiovascular events and bleeding during 1 year of treatment with a P2Y12 
inhibitor. Model inputs were identified from the literature. Lifetime costs were 
adjusted to 2017 US dollars; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were projected 
using a Markov model. The primary endpoint was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness compared to the next best option along the cost-effectiveness 
continuum. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all model inputs to assess 
their influence on the incremental cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) 
for the clopidogrel + phenotype, genotype + liberal ticagrelor, and universal 
ticagrelor strategies were $12,119/QALY, $29,412/QALY, and $142,456/QALY, 
respectively. Genotype + conservative ticagrelor and genotype + phenotype were 
not cost-effective due to second-order dominance. Genotype + liberal ticagrelor 
compared to clopidogrel + phenotype demonstrated the highest acceptance (97%) at 
a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Cost-effective strategies to personalize P2Y12 inhibition in ACS 
include clopidogrel +phenotype and genotype + liberal ticagrelor. Universal 
ticagrelor may be considered cost-effective at a higher WTP threshold 
($150,000/QALY). Genotype + liberal ticagrelor exhibited the highest 
acceptability compared to clopidogrel + phenotype over the widest range of WTP 
thresholds and may be preferred.

BACKGROUND: Moderate to high risk medical inpatients are at increased risk of 
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). The present study aims to investigate the 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of using Enoxaparin compared to Heparin in 
VTE prophylaxis in medical inpatients, from Iranian payer's perspective.
METHODS: Decision tree modeling technique was used to evaluate 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the compared interventions. The main 
considered outcomes were Life Years Gained (LYG) for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
(CEA) and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) for Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA). 
Costs and consequences of the interventions were evaluated for a three-month 
period and reported as Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs). One-way 
and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) were conducted to evaluate the 
robustness of the model due to uncertainty in the input data.
RESULTS: In base case scenario (i.e. public tariff), incremental cost was 
$10.32, and incremental QALY and incremental LYG were 0.0001 and 0.0002 per 
patients respectively. Base case ICERs were 60,376 USD/QALY and 71,077 USD/LYG 
per patient. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed the robustness of 
the model.
CONCLUSION: As the estimated ICER per QALY is more than three times the reported 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita by world bank for Iran in 2017 ($5415), 
the use of Enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis in medical in patients doesn't seem to 
be a cost-effective intervention compared to the use of Heparin in Iran.

This study investigated the effect of natamycin (NA) treatment on the quality of 
mulberry fruit throughout the storage at 8°C and 90% relative humidity. The 
results of this study showed that NA treatment reduced the decay rate of 
mulberry fruit, inhibited respiration, decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, 
decreased phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and polyphenoloxidase (PPO) 
activity, and maintained sucrose levels, total soluble solids (TSS), and total 
acids (TA) contents in the fruits throughout storage. NA treatment maintained 
the surface color and firmness of fruits throughout storage and suppressed the 
production of fructose, glucose, total phenolics, and the contents of 
anthocyanin. NA treatment maintained the quality of mulberry fruit throughout 
storage by enhancing the enzymatic activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
scavengers: catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) and 
inhibiting the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). Treatment of mulberries 
with increasing concentrations of NA could significantly inhibit the growth of 
fungal pathogens in mulberry fruits and improve their quality. PRACTICAL 
APPLICATIONS: The results from our previous study showed that NA was a safe 
preservative which could effectively inhibit the growth of molds and yeasts in 
mulberry fruits and improve their quality throughout the postharvest storage. 
Compared with other treatments for mulberry fruit, NA treatment has the 
advantages of low cost, simple operation, good application, and extension. The 
results in this study further prove that application of NA treatment has 
potential in the food industry to maintain the postharvest quality and extend 
the shelf life of mulberry fruits throughout storage.

PURPOSE: Results of a study incorporating real-world results into a predictive 
model to assess the cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic 
use in intensive care unit patients with sepsis are reported.
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to 
determine whether reductions in antibiotic therapy duration and other care 
improvements resulting from PCT testing and use of an associated treatment 
pathway offset the costs of PCT testing. Selected base-case cost outcomes in 
adults with sepsis admitted to a medical intensive care unit (MICU) were 
assessed in preintervention and postintervention cohorts using a decision 
analytic model. Cost-minimization and cost-utility analyses were performed from 
the hospital perspective with a 1-year time horizon. Secondary and univariate 
sensitivity analyses tested a variety of clinically relevant scenarios and the 
robustness of the model.
RESULTS: Base-case modeling predicted that use of a PCT-guided treatment 
algorithm would results in hospital cost savings of $45 per patient and result 
in a gain of 0.0001 quality-adjusted life-year. After exclusion of patients in 
the postintervention cohort for PCT test ordering outside of institutional 
guidelines, the mean inpatient antibiotic therapy duration was significantly 
reduced in the postintervention group relative to the preintervention group (6.2 
days versus 4.9 days, p = 0.04) after adjustment for patient sex and age, 
Charlson Comorbidity Index score, study period, vasopressor use, and ventilator 
use. Total annual hospital cost savings of $4,840 were predicted.
CONCLUSION: Real-world implementation of PCT-guided antibiotic use may have 
improved patients' quality of life while decreasing hospital costs in MICU 
patients with undifferentiated sepsis.

Conflicting results have been reported on whether closed kinetic chain exercises 
(such as a leg press) may induce more balanced activation of vastus medialis 
(VM) and lateralis (VL) muscles compared with open kinetic chain exercise (such 
as pure knee extension). This study aimed to 1) compare between-vasti motor unit 
activity and 2) analyze the combined motor unit behavior from both muscles 
between open and closed kinetic chain exercises. Thirteen participants (four 
women, mean ± SD age: 27 ± 5 yr) performed isometric knee extension and leg 
press at 10, 30, 50, 70% of the maximum voluntary torque. High density surface 
EMG signals were recorded from the VM and VL and motor unit firings were 
automatically identified by convolutive blind source separation. We estimated 
the total synaptic input received by the two muscles by analyzing the difference 
in discharge rate from recruitment to target torque for motor units matched by 
recruitment threshold. When controlling for recruitment threshold and discharge 
rate at recruitment, the motor unit discharge rates were higher for knee 
extension compared with the leg press exercise at 50% [estimate = 1.2 pulses per 
second (pps), standard error (SE) = 0.3 pps, P = 0.0138] and 70% (estimate = 2.0 
pps, SE = 0.3 pps, P = 0.0001) of maximal torque. However, no difference between 
the vasti muscles were detected in both exercises. The estimates of synaptic 
input to the muscles confirmed these results. In conclusion, the estimated 
synaptic input received by VM and VL was similar within and across exercises. 
However, both muscles had higher firing rates and estimated synaptic input at 
the highest torque levels during knee extension. Taken together, the results 
show that knee-extension is more suitable than leg-press exercise at increasing 
the concurrent activation of the vasti muscles.NEW & NOTEWORTHY There is a 
significant debate on whether open kinetic chain, single-joint knee extension 
exercise can influence the individual and combined activity of the vasti muscles 
compared with closed kinetic chain, multijoint leg press exercise. Here we show 
that attempting to change the contribution of either the vastus medialis or 
vastus lateralis via different forms of exercise does not seem to be a viable 
strategy. However, the adoption of open kinetic chain knee extension induces 
greater discharge rate and estimated synaptic input to both vasti muscles 
compared with the leg press.

Eccentric (ECC) contraction-induced muscle damage is associated with calcium ion 
(Ca2+) influx from the extracellular milieu through stretch-activated channels. 
It remains unknown whether Ca2+ influx consequent to repetitive ECC contractions 
is nonuniform across different muscle regions. We tested the hypothesis that 
there are regional differences in Ca2+ entry along the proximal-middle-distal 
muscle axis. Tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of adult male Wistar rats were 
exposed by reflecting the overlying skin and fasciae and ECC contractions evoked 
by peroneal nerve stimulation paired with simultaneous ankle extension (50 
times/set, 2 protocols: 1 set and 10 sets). During ECC in the proximal, middle, 
and distal TA, we determined 1) muscle fiber extension by high-speed camera (200 
frames/s) and 2) Ca2+ accumulation by in vivo bioimaging (Ca2+-sensitive probe 
Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester). Muscle fiber extension from resting was 
significantly different among regions (i.e., proximal, 4.0%: < middle, 11.2%: < 
distal, 17.0%; ECC phase length at 500th contraction). Intracellular Ca2+ 
accumulation after 1 set of ECC was higher in the distal (1.46 ± 0.04, P < 0.05) 
than the proximal (1.27 ± 0.04) or middle (1.26 ± 0.05) regions. However, this 
regional Ca2+ accumulation difference disappeared by 32.5 min after the 1 set 
protocol when the muscle was quiescent and by contraction set 5 for the 10-set 
protocol. The initial preferential ECC-induced Ca2+ accumulation observed 
distally was associated spatially with the greater muscle extension compared 
with that of the proximal and middle regions. Disappearance of the regional Ca2+ 
accumulation disparity in quiescent and ECC-contracting muscle might be 
explained, in part, by axial Ca2+ propagation and account for the uniformity of 
muscle damage across regions evident 3 days post-ECC.NEW & NOTEWORTHY After 1 
set of 50 eccentric (ECC) contractions in the anterior tibialis muscle, 
intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) accumulation evinces substantial regional 
heterogeneity that is spatially coherent with muscle length changes (i.e., 
distal [Ca2+]i > middle, proximal). However, irrespective of whether 50 or 500 
ECC contractions are performed, this heterogeneity is subsequently abolished, at 
least in part, by axial intracellular Ca2+ propagation. This Ca2+ homogenization 
across regions is consistent with the absence of any interregional difference in
