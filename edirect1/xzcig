BACKGROUND: Incidence of prostate cancer is increasing as opportunistic 
screening becomes widespread and life expectancy rises. Despite screening 
availability, research reveals conflicting results on medical outcomes, for 
example, disease specific mortality. However the gold standard in early 
diagnosis of potentially curable organ confined prostate cancer is transrectal 
ultrasound-guided systematic prostate biopsy (TRUS-BX). While focus has been 
given to medical sequalae there is a paucity of research on the psychological 
impact of biopsy. Awaiting biopsy may be inherently stressful but no studies to 
date, have assessed men's perception of stress and its impact on emotional 
response. This study, therefore, examines the role of stress and also personal 
resources namely, self-efficacy and sense of coherence in emotional adjustment 
in men awaiting a prostate biopsy.
METHODS: Men attending a Rapid Access Prostate Cancer Clinic for a transrectal 
prostate biopsy (N = 114) participated in the study. They completed self report 
questionnaires on perceived stress (PSS), generalised self-efficacy (GSES), and 
sense of coherence (SOC). Adjustment was measured by the Profile of Mood States 
(POMS-B) which assesses tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion and 
vigour.
RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that the set of 
predictors accounted for 17%-34% of variance across six mood states and 
predicted 46% of total mood disturbance. Perceived stress explained variance on 
all domains (11%-26%) with high stress linked to poor functioning.
CONCLUSION: Perceived stress was the strongest and most consistent predictor of 
emotional adjustment. This is an important finding as stress appraisal has not 
been examined previously in this context and suggests that stress management is 
an important target to enhance emotional wellbeing of men attending for a 
prostate biopsy.

BACKGROUND: Twelve of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are related to 
malnutrition (both under- and overnutrition), other behavioral, and metabolic 
risk factors. However, comparative evidence on the impact of behavioral and 
metabolic risk factors on disease burden is limited in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), 
including Ethiopia. Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study, we 
assessed mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to 
child and maternal undernutrition (CMU), dietary risks, metabolic risks and low 
physical activity for Ethiopia. The results were compared with 14 other Eastern 
SSA countries.
METHODS: Databases from GBD 2015, that consist of data from 1990 to 2015, were 
used. A comparative risk assessment approach was utilized to estimate the burden 
of disease attributable to CMU, dietary risks, metabolic risks and low physical 
activity. Exposure levels of the risk factors were estimated using 
spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) and Bayesian meta-regression 
models.
RESULTS: In 2015, there were 58,783 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 
43,653-76,020] or 8.9% [95% UI: 6.1-12.5] estimated all-cause deaths 
attributable to CMU, 66,269 [95% UI: 39,367-106,512] or 9.7% [95% UI: 7.4-12.3] 
to dietary risks, 105,057 [95% UI: 66,167-157,071] or 15.4% [95% UI: 12.8-17.6] 
to metabolic risks and 5808 [95% UI: 3449-9359] or 0.9% [95% UI: 0.6-1.1] to low 
physical activity in Ethiopia. While the age-adjusted proportion of all-cause 
mortality attributable to CMU decreased significantly between 1990 and 2015, it 
increased from 10.8% [95% UI: 8.8-13.3] to 14.5% [95% UI: 11.7-18.0] for dietary 
risks and from 17.0% [95% UI: 15.4-18.7] to 24.2% [95% UI: 22.2-26.1] for 
metabolic risks. In 2015, Ethiopia ranked among the top four countries (of 15 
Eastern SSA countries) in terms of mortality and DALYs based on the 
age-standardized proportion of disease attributable to dietary and metabolic 
risks.
CONCLUSIONS: In Ethiopia, while there was a decline in mortality and DALYs 
attributable to CMU over the last two and half decades, the burden attributable 
to dietary and metabolic risks have increased during the same period. Lifestyle 
and metabolic risks of NCDs require more attention by the primary health care 
system of the country.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the proportion of patients with higher risk localized 
prostate cancer (PCa) that would become safely biopsy negative 12 months after 
non-thermal focal therapy with padeliporfin vascular-targeted photodynamic 
therapy (VTP).
METHODS: Multicenter study in a scenario of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
≤20ng/ml and variable PCa target volumes Gleason pattern 3 or low-volume 
secondary Gleason pattern 4, all patients received VTP, consisting of 
intravenous 4mg/kg padeliporfin activated by light-diffusing fibers in the 
prostate. The prostate was biopsied at baseline, months 6 and 12, PSA, 
patient-reported functional outcomes and quality of life (QoL) questionnaires 
were recorded at baseline, months 3, 6, and 12 and adverse events (AE) 
throughout the study.
RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat population (n=81), the proportion of patients 
with negative biopsies at month 12 was 74% (60/81 patients; 95% CI: 
63.1%,83.2%). In the per-protocol population, the proportion was 79% (58/73 
patients; 95% CI: 68.4%,88.0%). Questionnaire results indicated a slight 
improvement in urinary function and limited deterioration in sexual function. No 
difference in QoL was observed over time. A total of 42/81 (52%) patients 
reported mild or moderate and 4 of 81 (4.9%) experienced serious AE, all 
resolved without sequelae. No phototoxicity, cardiovascular event, fistula or 
prolonged urinary incontinence, secondary cancer or death was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Results support the efficacy, safety, and QoL associated with 
padeliporfin focal treatment for low/intermediate risk localized PCa.

BACKGROUND: Environmental risk factors can have a substantial impact on 
population health. With the environmental burden of disease (EBD) approach, the 
health losses attributable to environmental risk factors can be quantified using 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to present and discuss available EBD 
estimates with a focus on Germany.
MATERIALS: Using current EBD studies, the share of the burden of disease 
attributable to environmental risk factors globally and DALYs for Germany are 
presented. Ambient particulate matter (PM), water-related risks and 
environmental noise are used as examples to emphasize the importance of 
availability and quality of input data for burden of disease assessments.
RESULTS: The share of the global burden of disease attributable to environmental 
risk factors varies according to the available studies and lies between 13 and 
22%. For Germany, EBD estimates are available for 12 environmental risk factors. 
Most estimates are available for particulate matter in ambient air, however, the 
estimated burden differs greatly. Nonetheless, according to current knowledge, 
particulate matter pollution is the environmental risk factor with the highest 
burden of disease in Germany.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the estimated burden of disease for the considered 
risk factors are due to varying underlying assumptions, e. g. for life 
expectancy or counterfactual value and the input data used.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be treated using a maze procedure 
during planned cardiac surgery, but the effect on clinical patient outcomes, and 
the cost-effectiveness compared with surgery alone, are uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not the maze procedure is safe, improves 
clinical and patient outcomes and is cost-effective for the NHS in patients with 
AF.
DESIGN: Multicentre, Phase III, pragmatic, double-blind, parallel-arm randomised 
controlled trial. Patients were randomised on a 1 : 1 basis using random 
permuted blocks, stratified for surgeon and planned procedure.
SETTING: Eleven acute NHS specialist cardiac surgical centres.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years, scheduled for elective or in-house 
urgent cardiac surgery, with a documented history (> 3 months) of AF.
INTERVENTIONS: Routine cardiac surgery with or without an adjunct maze procedure 
administered by an AF ablation device.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were return to sinus rhythm (SR) at 
12 months and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 2 years after 
randomisation. Secondary outcomes included return to SR at 2 years, overall and 
stroke-free survival, drug use, quality of life (QoL), cost-effectiveness and 
safety.
RESULTS: Between 25 February 2009 and 6 March 2014, 352 patients were randomised 
to the control (n = 176) or experimental (n = 176) arms. The odds ratio (OR) for 
return to SR at 12 months was 2.06 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 3.54; 
p = 0.0091]. The mean difference (95% CI) in QALYs at 2 years between the two 
trial arms (maze/control) was -0.025 (95% CI 0.129 to 0.078; p = 0.6319). The OR 
for SR at 2 years was 3.24 (95% CI 1.76 to 5.96). The number of patients 
requiring anticoagulant drug use was significantly lower in the maze arm from 6 
months after the procedure. There were no significant differences between the 
two arms in operative or overall survival, stroke-free survival, need for 
cardioversion or permanent pacemaker implants, New York Heart Association 
Functional Classification (for heart failure), EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level 
version score and Short Form questionnaire-36 items score at any time point. 
Sixty per cent of patients in each trial arm had a serious adverse event 
(p = 1.000); most events were mild, but 71 patients (42.5%) in the maze arm and 
84 patients (45.5%) in the control arm had moderately severe events; 31 patients 
(18.6%) in the maze arm and 38 patients (20.5%) in the control arm had severe 
events. The mean additional cost of the maze procedure was £3533 (95% CI £1321 
to £5746); the mean difference in QALYs was -0.022 (95% CI -0.1231 to 0.0791). 
The maze procedure was not cost-effective at £30,000 per QALY over 2 years in 
any analysis. In a small substudy, the active left atrial ejection fraction was 
smaller than that of the control patients (mean difference of -8.03, 95% CI 
-12.43 to -3.62), but within the predefined clinically equivalent range.
LIMITATIONS: Low recruitment, early release of trial summaries and intermittent 
resource-use collection may have introduced bias and imprecise estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Ablation can be practised safely in routine NHS cardiac surgical 
settings and increases return to SR rates, but not survival or QoL up to 2 years 
after surgery. Lower anticoagulant drug use and recovery of left atrial function 
support anticoagulant drug withdrawal provided that good atrial function is 
confirmed.
FURTHER WORK: Continued follow-up and long-term clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness analysis. Comparison of ablation methods.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN82731440.

In the Current Era of Endovascular Surgery, What is the Role of Axillofemoral 
Bypass?

INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, axillofemoral bypass is viewed as an end-of-line 
solution for lower limb revascularization, owing to its classically described 
poor long-term patency, and recent advances in endovascular options for patients 
with complex aortoiliac anatomy not suitable for open reconstruction. There is a 
marked difference in patient profiles in published series of axillofemoral 
bypass, reflecting changing procedures indications due to technical innovations. 
The objective of this study is to determine the contemporary profile of patients 
treated with axillofemoral bypass and their outcome.
METHODS: Patients who underwent axillofemoral bypass surgery in a tertiary 
hospital from April 2011 to September 2017 were identified. Surgical indication, 
patency, amputation and death rates were recorded. Patients were grouped in 
axillouni vs axillobifemoral, 1st revascularization procedure vs reintervention, 
and primary aortoiliac occlusive disease vs primary aneurysmal disease, and were 
compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: 54 patients were included. 80% underwent an axillobifemoral bypass. 
Median age was 67 years; 96% were male. The most prevalent cardiovascular risk 
factors were HTA (81%) and history of smoking (76%). Primary vascular disease 
was aneurysmal in 24% of patients. The remaining group had peripheral occlusive 
arterial disease. In 53%, axillofemoral bypass was the first revascularization 
performed (naif group). On these, indications for this procedure were 
aorto-iliac occlusive disease (89%) and AA thrombosis (19%). In patients 
previously submitted to revascularization (47%), the most common first 
procedures were aortobifemoral bypass (56%), femoro-femoral bypass (44%) and 
EVAR (36%). Indications for axillofemoral bypass on this group were: prosthesis 
thrombosis (64%), secondary aorto-enteric fistulae (28%) and prosthesis 
infection (8%). Primary patency of axillofemoral bypass was 93% at 1 month and 
80% at 5 years (Graphic 1). Differences were not significant regardless the 
vascular surgery status (naif vs reintervention), but axillobifemoral bypass and 
aneurysmal disease groups had a higher patency than axillounifemoral bypass and 
occlusive disease groups, respectively. No patient with aneurysmal disease 
required amputation over a 5-year follow-up. In primary occlusive disease group, 
88% of patients were free-of-amputation at 1 month and 83% at 5 years. Patients 
who underwent this procedure had a survival rate of 78% at 1 month and 59% at 5 
years (Graphic 2). No major difference was recorded between study groups.
CONCLUSION: Axillofemoral bypass, although being an increasingly uncommon 
procedure, still allows acceptable rates of patency and limb salvage. As 
patients with aortoiliac disease usually have multiple comorbidities and a short 
life- -expectancy, axillofemoral bypass is attractive owing to its less invasive 
character.

INTRODUCTION: Non-small cell lung cancer is a very common disease in the elderly 
population and its incidence in this particular population is expected to 
increase further, because of the ageing of the Western population. Pulmonary 
resection is often not recommended in the elderly, even though they have no 
medical contraindications to surgery. Such patients are postulated to have a 
limited life expectancy, the rate of complications and perioperative death is 
considered to be higher than younger population. However, decision making is 
extremely difficult, since this group in under- represented in clinical trials.
METHODS: This study aim to do a retrospective analysis of comorbidity, surgical 
procedures and pos- operative complications for surgery in patients older than 
70 years of age who underwent a pulmonary resection for lung cancer. We analysed 
the clinical records of all patients with Non-small cell lung cancer submitted 
to surgery during the period 2012 to 2016 in our department and divide them in 2 
groups: elderly group (more than 70 years old) and group control.
RESULTS: In the five years study period, our department performed pulmonary 
resection in 601 patients with NSCLC, of whom 209 (34,8%) were 70 years and 
older. The mean age was 74,6 years old in the elderly group and 58,6 in the 
control group. Preoperative comorbidities such as cardiac and previous neoplasic 
diseases were more frequent in the elderly group, and the percentage of smokers 
was higher in the control group (80,1% vs 61,7%). A segmentar or wedge resection 
was performed more frequent for the elderly group (16,7%) than in the control 
group (6,6%), whereas pneumonectomies and lobectomies were performed more 
frequently. The ratio of pos-operative complications, especially cardiac 
complications, was higher in the elderly patients (12,9% vs 8,2%), however, 
there was no significant difference in prevalence of pulmonary/ respiratory 
complications, such pulmonary leakage, pneumonia or empyema between the 2 
groups. There was no operative or hospital death in any of the groups.
CONCLUSION: Advanced age alone is not a contraindication to surgical resection 
on NSCLC. Elderly patients should be offered the best treatment possible, 
considering surgical risk on an individualized basis, and keeping in mind that 
surgery offers the best results when the disease is resectable.

Heart rate variability testing: could it change spending for rheumatoid 
arthritis patients in the United States? An exploratory economic analysis.

BACKGROUND: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) testing with heart rate variability 
(HRV) has been shown in early research to predict 52-week outcomes in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). HRV testing could be combined with putative ANS biologic 
pathways to improve treatment response for RA patients. This study explored 
potential costs and health outcomes of introducing HRV testing into RA 
treatment, without and with ANS optimization.
METHODS: A decision tree exploratory economic model compared HRV testing to 
standard care in moderate-to-severe biologic-eligible patients over a 10-year 
time horizon. HRV data was derived from an observational study of RA patients 
(n = 33). Patients were stratified into treatment groups based on HRV test 
scores indicating "low probability of response" and "moderate to high 
probability of response". This study explored adding ANS optimization based on 
HRV score followed by clinically-appropriate treatment. Costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the US population were estimated.
RESULTS: HRV testing in biologic-eligible patients decreased non-effective 
biologic use, reducing US healthcare costs by $34.6 billion over 10 years with 
QALYs unchanged. When combined with ANS optimization in biologic-eligible 
patients, HRV testing could increase costs by $3.6 billion over 10 years but 
save over 350,000 QALYs. Among all RA patients, HRV testing with ANS 
optimization could save over $8 billion and over 100,000 QALYs over 10 years, 
depending on the positive predictive value (PPV) of the HRV test.
CONCLUSIONS: The potential economic impact of introducing HRV testing and ANS 
optimization into RA treatment appears substantial and cost-effective based on 
the exploratory analysis. Additional rigorous studies are warranted in larger 
patient samples to better inform decision-making.

In recent years, the United States has had a relatively poor performance with 
respect to life expectancy compared to the other developed nations. Urban sprawl 
is one of the potential causes of the high rate of mortality in the United 
States. This study investigated cross-sectional associations between sprawl and 
life expectancy for metropolitan counties in the United States in 2010. In this 
study, the measure of life expectancy in 2010 came from a recently released 
dataset of life expectancies by county. This study modeled average life 
expectancy with a structural equation model that included five mediators: annual 
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per household, average body mass index, crime rate, 
and air quality index as mediators of sprawl, as well as percentage of smokers 
as a mediator of socioeconomic status. After controlling for sociodemographic 
characteristics, this study found that life expectancy was significantly higher 
in compact counties than in sprawling counties. Compactness affects mortality 
directly, but the causal mechanism is unclear. For example, it may be that 
sprawling areas have higher traffic speeds and longer emergency response times, 
lower quality and less accessible health care facilities, or less availability 
of healthy foods. Compactness affects mortality indirectly through vehicle miles 
traveled, which is a contributor to traffic fatalities, and through body mass 
index, which is a contributor to many chronic diseases. This study identified 
significant direct and indirect associations between urban sprawl and life 
expectancy. These findings support further research and practice aimed at 
identifying and implementing changes to urban planning designed to support 
health and healthy behaviors.

The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were used to estimate the regional 
(state of Colima, Mexico) cancer burden in 2010⁻2014. The years of life lost 
(YLL) were estimated with mortality data and years lived with disability (YLD) 
using incidence data. The DALYs were calculated as the arithmetic addition of 
YLL and YLD. Sex and cancer site-specific estimations were made and DALY rates 
were used to identify the leading causes of disease burden. Data from 2532 
deaths were analyzed and, for all malignant tumors combined, 18,712.9 DALYs and 
20,243.3 DALYs were estimated in males and females respectively. The overall 
contribution of YLL in DALY estimates was higher among females (93.7% vs. 
87.4%). Age-standardized DALY rates (and 95% confidence intervals, CI) per 
100,000 inhabitants were used to rank the leading causes of disease burden and, 
among males, malignant tumors from the prostate, lower respiratory tract, and 
colon and rectum accounted the highest rates (45.7, 95% CI 32.7⁻59.3; 37.6, 95% 
CI 25.7⁻49.9; and 25.9, 95% CI 16.0⁻36.1 DALYs). Breast, cervix uteri, and lower 
respiratory tract cancer showed the highest burden in females (66.0, 95% CI 
50.3⁻82.4; 44.4, 95% CI 31.5⁻57.7; and 20.9, 95% CI 12.0⁻30.0 DALYs). The 
present study provides an indication of the burden of cancer at the regional 
level, underscoring the need to expand cancer prevention, screening, and 
awareness programs, as well as to improve early diagnosis and medical treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To grade adverse events (AEs) occurring after chemotherapy in the 
cancer patients and to explore the quality-of-life (QOL) findings among 
posttherapy cancer patients in a rural, secondary level care Indian hospital.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out during a 6-month period in a 
rural secondary level care hospital situated at Anantapur district in South 
India. Patient and cancer demographics were collected from the cases treated in 
the study site. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 v 3.0 Telugu (regional language of the study 
site) module and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0 of Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program, USA, were used to assess the QOL and severity grades 
of AEs, respectively.
RESULTS: Most AEs were mild or moderate, with only a few being severe. Insomnia 
(27.98%), nausea (13.50%), vomiting (12.81%), fatigue (10.90%), and pain 
(11.68%) were common, with insomnia being the most frequent. The different 
scores of the QOL scale (functional, symptomatic, financial, and global health 
status scores) were assessed independently. Among the functional scale 
parameters, the cognitive and physical functioning scores were good (85.14 and 
82.79, respectively) and the social, emotional, and role functioning scores were 
moderate (77.94, 72.30, and 71.65, respectively). The overall effect of symptoms 
on QOL showed that the pain score was higher and interfered to a higher extent 
in patients (36.02) and the dyspnea score was the least and occurred to a lesser 
extent (7.20). But certain variables such as anorexia, for example, showed a 
greater interquartile range and SD, which implied that it gave a lesser chance 
for the prediction of results for that particular condition. Financial burden 
existed to a moderate level on an average in all the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence and severity of AEs was low, indicating that the 
patients tolerated and responded well to therapy. The survivorship is yet to be 
estimated and the life expectancy to be studied by further investigation of the 
subjects.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the costs and effectiveness of two 
alternative stent, drug eluting stent (SF) and bare metal stent (SNF).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cost-utility analysis based on a Markov model using data 
from a cohort study of Hospital Las Higueras of Talcahuano, Chile. The 
effectiveness measure was the rate of restenosis and the time of restenosis. The 
effectiveness outcomes are expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
gained. Costs are expressed in national currency 2011. The evaluation 
perspective was from the public heath budget. We model a cohort from age 63 to 
80 years, life expectancy in Chile. Apply discount rate of 0, 3% and 6% for 
results and costs. Sensitivity analysis is performed according to the ranges of 
variability in costs, the utility values of the variables and transition between 
states.
RESULTS: No differences in restenosis rates between the two stents, although 
there were differences in the time of restenosis. The incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (ICER) no discount rate was CH$ 235.749 per QALY gained when 
using drug-eluting stent, the value below the equivalent of 1 Gross Domestic 
Product (PIB) per capita for 2011 in Chile.
CONCLUSIONS: The drug-eluting stent (SF) is cost effective compared to bare 
metal stent (SNF). The ICER is not affected by the sensitivity analysis 
(variability of cost, utility ranges used, probability of restenosis).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies 
for colorectal cancer in Colombia.
METHODS: We designed a Markov model to compare the clinical and economic impact 
in terms of reducing the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). 
Six screening strategies for adults were compared: fecal occult blood (FOBT) 
immunochemical and guaiac type, conventional colonoscopy, flexible 
sigmoidoscopy, and FOBT guaiac and immunochemical type more sigmoidoscopy. We 
used the third-party payer perspective, including only direct costs, the time 
horizon was the life expectancy of the Colombian population. We estimated 
cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) and incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER). Were 
performed deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic. We applied a 
discount rate of 3% in the costs and health outcomes.
RESULTS: The screening strategy more cost-effective was the FOBT biennial guaiac 
type. The cost per life year gained was US$10,347.37, US$18,380.64, and 
US$45,158.05. For FOBT guaiac biennial, FOBT guaiac annual and FOBT 
inmunoquímica biennial respectively. The ICER is sensitive to the percentage of 
false positive test for FOBT guaiac type values greater than 10%, and the cost 
of the test.
CONCLUSIONS: The screening strategy more cost-effective for Colombia is the FOBT 
biennial guaiac type, using as a threshold the gross domestic product (GDP) per 
capita in Colombia.

BACKGROUND: The association between repetitive hip moment impulse and the 
progression of hip osteoarthritis is a recently recognized area of study. A 
sit-to-stand movement is essential for daily life and requires hip extension 
moment. Although a change in the sit-to-stand movement time may influence the 
hip moment impulse in the sagittal plane, this effect has not been examined. The 
purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between sit-to-stand 
movement time and hip moment impulse in the sagittal plane.
METHODS: Twenty subjects performed the sit-to-stand movement at a self-selected 
natural speed. The hip, knee, and ankle joint angles obtained from experimental 
trials were used to perform two computer simulations. In the first simulation, 
the actual sit-to-stand movement time obtained from the experiment was entered. 
In the second simulation, sit-to-stand movement times ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 s 
at intervals of 0.25 s were entered. Hip joint moments and hip moment impulses 
in the sagittal plane during sit-to-stand movements were calculated for both 
computer simulations.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The reliability of the simulation model was confirmed, 
as indicated by the similarities in the hip joint moment waveforms (r = 0.99) 
and the hip moment impulses in the sagittal plane between the first computer 
simulation and the experiment. In the second computer simulation, the hip moment 
impulse in the sagittal plane decreased with a decrease in the sit-to-stand 
movement time, although the peak hip extension moment increased with a decrease 
in the movement time. These findings clarify the association between the 
sit-to-stand movement time and hip moment impulse in the sagittal plane and may 
contribute to the prevention of the progression of hip osteoarthritis.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a global public health problem especially in 
developing countries experiencing war/conflicts. War might be one of the 
socio-political factors influencing malnutrition in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) 
countries. This study aims at determining the influence of war on corruption, 
population (POP), number of population malnourished (NPU), food security and 
life expectancy (LE) in war-torn SSA countries (WTSSA) by comparing their 
malnutrition indicators.
METHODS: Fourteen countries in WTSSA were stratified into zones according to war 
incidences. Countries' secondary data on population (POP), NPU, Food Security 
Index (FSI), corruption perceptions index (CPI), Global Hunger Index (GHI) and 
LE were obtained from global published data. T test, multivariate and Pearson 
correlation analyses were performed to determine the relationship between CPI, 
POP, GHI, FSI, NPU, male LE (MLE) and female LE (FLE) in WTSSA at p < .05. Data 
were presented in tables, means, standard deviation and percentages.
RESULTS: Mean NPU, CPI, GHI, POP, FSI, MLE and FLE in WTSSA were 5.0 million, 
28.3%, 18.2%, 33.8 million, 30.8%, 54.7 years and 57.1 years, respectively. GHI 
significantly influenced LE in both male and female POP in WTSSA. NPU, CPI, FSI, 
GHI and FLE were not significantly different according to zones except in MLE.
CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition indicators were similarly affected in WTSSA. Hunger 
influenced life expectancy. Policies promoting good governance, equity, peaceful 
co-existence, respect for human right and adequate food supply will aid 
malnutrition eradication and prevent war occurrences in Sub-Saharan African 
countries.

Bariatric surgery became consensual after the NIH consensus of 1991 and the 
appearance of laparoscopic approach. This type of operation has a functional 
role (improvement of quality of life, locomotion and digestive symptoms as 
gastro-esophageal reflux disease), a prevention role (increase in life 
expectancy, reduction of risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease) and a 
curative role (remission of diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
and arterial hypertension). The laparoscopic approach for bariatric surgery led 
to a major reduction of postoperative morbi-mortality. Types and rates of 
complications after bariatric surgery vary according to the procedure. The 
efficiency of each technique is closely related to its morbi-mortality rate. 
This concept explains the disparity concerning the choice of the adequate 
procedure for the patient according to the bariatric team. The risk/benefits 
balance evaluation must be analyzed case-by-case by each specialist of the 
multidisciplinary bariatric staff and explained to the patients before final 
decision. This preoperative period (6 to 12 months) is crucial to select good 
candidates for bariatric surgery and contributes to the reduction of 
postoperative complications. A multidisciplinary surveillance for life is 
mandatory to prevent and treat late complications of bariatric surgery.

The increasing demand for healthcare and the resulting pressure on available 
budgets render priority setting inevitable. If societies aim to improve health 
and distribute health(care) fairly, equity-efficiency trade-offs are necessary. 
In the Netherlands, proportional shortfall (PS) was introduced to quantify 
necessity of care, allowing a direct equity-efficiency trade-off. This study 
describes the history and application of PS in the Netherlands and examines the 
theoretical and empirical support for PS as well as its current role in 
healthcare decision making. We reviewed the international literature on PS from 
2001 onwards, along with publicly accessible meeting reports from the Dutch 
appraisal committee, Adviescommissie Pakket (ACP), from 2013 to 2016. Our 
results indicate that there is support for the decision model in which necessity 
is quantified and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are evaluated against 
associated monetary reference values. The model enables a uniform framework for 
priority setting across all healthcare sectors. Although consensus about the 
application of PS has not yet been reached and alternative ways to quantify 
necessity were found in ACP reports, PS has increasingly been applied in 
decision making since 2015. However, empirical support for PS is limited and it 
may insufficiently reflect societal preferences regarding age and reducing 
lifetime-health inequalities. Hence, further investigation into refining PS-or 
exploration of another approach-appears warranted for operationalising the 
equity-efficiency trade-off.

The Orchidaceae is a diverse and ecologically important plant family. 
Approximately 69% of all orchid species are epiphytes, which provide diverse 
microhabitats for many small animals and fungi in the canopy of tropical 
rainforests. Moreover, many orchids are of economic importance as food 
flavourings or ornamental plants. Phalaenopsis aphrodite, an epiphytic orchid, 
is a major breeding parent of many commercial orchid hybrids. We provide a 
high-quality chromosome-scale assembly of the P. aphrodite genome. The total 
length of all scaffolds is 1025.1 Mb, with N50 scaffold size of 19.7 Mb. A total 
of 28 902 protein-coding genes were identified. We constructed an orchid genetic 
linkage map, and then anchored and ordered the genomic scaffolds along the 
linkage groups. We also established a high-resolution pachytene karyotype of 
P. aphrodite and completed the assignment of linkage groups to the 19 
chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization. We identified an expansion 
in the epiphytic orchid lineage of FRS5-like subclade associated with 
adaptations to the life in the canopy. Phylogenetic analysis further provides 
new insights into the orchid lineage-specific duplications of MADS-box genes, 
which might have contributed to the variation in labellum and pollinium 
morphology and its accessory structure. To our knowledge, this is the first 
orchid genome to be integrated with a SNP-based genetic linkage map and 
validated by physical mapping. The genome and genetic map not only offer 
unprecedented resources for increasing breeding efficiency in horticultural 
orchids but also provide an important foundation for future studies in
