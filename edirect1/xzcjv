Furthermore the increased number of aged people, due to the rise of life 
expectancy, needs more strategies to limit the bone loss and regenerate the lost 
tissue, ameliorating the life quality of patients. A great interest for 
non-pharmacological therapies based on natural compounds is emerging and 
focusing on the oligostilbene Polydatin, present in many kinds of fruits and 
vegetables, when resveratrol particularly in red wines. These molecules have 
been extensively studied due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, 
showing more recently Resveratrol the ability to enhance osteogenic 
differentiation and bone formation. However, the clinical applications of 
Resveratrol are limited due to its low bioavailability and rapid metabolism, 
while its natural glycosilated precursor Polydatin shows better metabolic 
stability and major abundance in fresh fruits and vegetables. Nevertheless the 
role of Polydatin on osteogenic differentiation is still unexplored. Mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs) from dental tissues, such as dental bud stem cells (DBSCs), 
are able to differentiate toward osteogenic lineage: thus we investigated how 
Resveratrol and Polydatin influence the differentiation of DBSCs, eventually 
affecting bone formation. Our results showed that Polydatin increases MSCs 
osteogenic differentiation sharing similar properties with Resveratrol. These 
results encourage to deepen the effects of this molecule on bone health and its 
associated mechanisms of action, wishing for the future a successful use in bone 
loss prevention and therapy.

BACKGROUND: Ebstein anomaly is an uncommon, complex congenital malformation of 
the heart with prevalence of 0.3-0.5%. It occurs in 1% of congenital heart 
disease cases. It is characterized by dysplastic abnormalities of tricuspid 
valve which involves both basal and free attachments of the tricuspid valve 
leaflets, with downward displacement and elongation of the septal and anterior 
cusp which resulting in tricuspid regurgitation, the proximal part of the right 
ventricle is "atrialised", becoming thin walled and poorly contractile, along 
with an enlarged right atrium. With this anomaly, fertility is usually 
unaffected, even in women with cyanosis. The average life expectancy at birth of 
patients with Ebstein anomaly is 25-30 years. Due to its rarity and varied 
clinical presentations associated with Ebstein anomaly during pregnancy, this 
case was presented in this paper.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 24 year old G2A1 at 39 weeks 6 days gestation with a known 
case of Ebstein anomaly was referred to NEIGRIHMS in April 2017 for further 
management as our institute is having well equipped cardiac facilities. Her 
antepartum period was uneventful. Elective LSCS was done at 40 weeks 3 days and 
a healthy baby weighing 2.5 kg was delivered. Intra and postpartum period was 
uneventful.
CONCLUSION: Due to varied clinical presentations associated with Ebstein anomaly 
during pregnancy, such women should undergo close surveillance with 
multidisciplinary approach during the antenatal period to be diagnosed in terms 
of complications and hence be treated accordingly.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this literature review was to evaluate the existing 
evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of treatment options in IBD.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify 
economic evaluations of IBD therapy. The literature search was performed using 
electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE. Searches were limited to full economic 
evaluations published in English or French between 2004 and 2016.
RESULTS: A total of 5,403 potentially relevant studies were identified. After 
screening titles and abstracts, 48 studies were included, according to the 
eligibility criteria. A total of 56% and 42% of the studies were assessing 
treatments of UC or CD, respectively. Treatment options under evaluation 
included biological agents, mesalamine, immunosuppressants, and surgery. The 
majority of studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of biological treatments. 
Biological therapies were dominant in 23% of the analyses and were 
cost-effective according to a $CAD50,000/QALY and $CAD100,000/QALY threshold in 
41% and 62% of the analyses, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This literature review provided a comprehensive overview of the 
economic evaluations for the different treatment options for IBD over the past 
12 years and represents a helpful reference for future economic evaluations.

Self-reproduction is one of the most important characteristics of lipid vesicles 
for origin of life research. Most vesicle self-reproduction systems are based on 
fatty acid vesicles and spontaneous phospholipid vesicle production is difficult 
owing to the relatively high stability of these vesicles. Now, spontaneous 
phospholipid vesicle generation and extension in a dipeptide/phospholipid system 
is demonstrated. Dissolution of the dipeptide crystal provides both the driving 
force and phospholipid constituents for vesicle generation and extension. This 
study provides a new system to enhance the understanding of vesicle 
self-reproduction mechanisms.

OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease with high 
mortality for solid-organ transplantation. Preventive therapy of latent 
tuberculosis infection (LTBI) has been considered to reduce TB risk and improve 
outcomes of transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs); 
QuantiFERON®-TB Gold in-Tube (QFT) and T-SPOT®.TB (TSPOT)), for kidney, liver 
and lung transplant recipients in low TB incidence countries.
METHODS: Decision trees and Markov models were developed for four strategies; 
QFT, TSPOT, the tuberculin skin test (TST) and no screening. Targeted 
populations were hypothetical cohorts of kidney, liver and lung transplant 
recipients aged 40 years using a societal perspective on a lifetime horizon. 
Per-person costs, effectiveness and incremental cost effectiveness ratios were 
calculated and compared.
RESULTS: QFT was the most cost-effective (Kidney; US$ 5679, 3.026 QALYs, Liver; 
US$ 5914, 2.365 QALYs, Lung; US$ 6092, 3.761 QALYs). No screening was the least 
effective. Cost-effectiveness was not sensitive to BCG vaccination rate, and the 
costs of screening tests and treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: TB screening using IGRA with individualized TB risk assessment and 
follow-up monitoring of drug toxicity during LTBI treatment is recommended for 
solid organ transplantation, on the basis of the benefits and 
cost-effectiveness.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) belong to an important 
therapeutic class for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Six GLP-1 RAs, each 
utilizing a unique drug delivery strategy, are now approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and additional, novel GLP-1 RAs are still under 
development, making for a crowded marketplace and fierce competition among the 
manufacturers of these products. As rapid elimination is a major challenge for 
clinical application of GLP-1 RAs, various half-life extension strategies have 
been successfully employed including sequential modification, attachment of 
fatty-acid to peptide, fusion with human serum albumin, fusion with the fragment 
crystallizable (Fc) region of a monoclonal antibody, sustained drug delivery 
systems, and PEGylation. In this review, we discuss the scientific rationale of 
the various half-life extension strategies used for GLP-1 RA development. By 
analyzing and comparing different approved GLP-1 RAs and those in development, 
we focus on assessing how half-life extending strategies impact the 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, patient usability and ultimately, 
the commercial success of GLP-1 RA products. We also anticipate future GLP-1 RA 
development trends. Since similar drug delivery strategies are also applied for 
developing other therapeutic peptides, we expect this case study of GLP-1 RAs 
will provide generalizable concepts for the rational design of therapeutic 
peptides products with extended duration of action.

BACKGROUND: Renal denervation (RDN) is effective at reducing blood pressure (BP) 
among patients with treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH). However, recent 
findings regarding the effectiveness of RDN for BP reduction compared with 
standard treatment of care (SoC) has initiated a rigorous debate about its role 
in TRH management. In this study, we sought to determine the thresholds for 
cardiovascular risk and costs of RDN which would make RDN cost-effective.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate cardiovascular events over a 
lifetime among TRH subjects aged 60 years at baseline, and without prior 
cardiovascular disease. The effect on lowering BP was based on results observed 
in clinical trials of RDN undertaken to date, and the expected subsequent change 
to cardiovascular risk was drawn from a published meta-regression. Cost and 
utility data were drawn from published sources. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICER) in terms of Australian dollars (AUD) per life year and per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were estimated to assess RDN 
cost-effectiveness relative to SoC from the Australian health care perspective, 
assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD 50,000.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, the model predicted that at the current 
estimated costs of RDN (AUD 9531/€6573, 1€ = 1.45 AUD), it would be 
cost-effective only if it was targeted to patients whose 10-year predicted 
cardiovascular risk was at least 13.2% initially. The ICERs (discounted) were 
AUD 49,519 per life year gained and AUD 47,130 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: At current costs and based on currently observed effects on BP 
reduction, RDN would be cost-effective among patients with TRH.

Loss of skeletal muscle mass and function is a hallmark of aging. This 
phenomenon has been related to a dysregulation of mitochondrial function and 
proteostasis. Calorie restriction (CR) has been demonstrated to delay aging and 
preserve function until late in life, particularly in muscle. Recently, we 
reported the type of dietary fat plays an important role in determining life 
span extension with 40% CR in male mice. In these conditions, lard fed mice 
showed an increased longevity compared to mice fed soybean or fish oils. In this 
article, we analyze the effect of 40% CR on muscle mitochondrial mass, 
autophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics markers in mice fed these diets. In CR fed 
animals, lard preserved muscle fibers structure, mitochondrial ultrastructure, 
and fission/fusion dynamics and autophagy, not only compared to control animals, 
but also compared with CR mice fed soybean and fish oils as dietary fat. We 
focus our discussion on dietary fatty acid saturation degree as an essential 
predictor of life span extension in CR mice.

The population dynamics of the blister beetle, Epicauta impressicornis (Pic) 
(Coleoptera: Meloidae) had been investigated from 2014 to 2016 in field. The 
results showed that E. impressicornis is univoltine and overwintered in the 
fifth instar in the Luodian area of Guizhou, China. The biological and 
ecological characteristic of the beetle were analyzed at six temperatures (i.e., 
21, 24, 27, 30, 33, and 36°C) in the laboratory using the age-stage, two-sex 
life table. The developmental duration, longevity, and total preoviposition 
period were significantly shortened with increases in temperatures. The adult 
preoviposition periods at 24, 27, and 30°C were significantly longer than at 
other temperatures, while the fecundities at 27 and 30°C were significantly 
higher than at other temperatures. Life expectancy (exj) decreased with age and 
the reproductive value (vxj) increased with age. The intrinsic rate of increase 
(r = 0.0921 d-1) and finite rate (λ = 1.0965 d-1) were the highest at 33°C, 
followed by 30°C (r = 0.0758 d-1, λ = 1.0788 d-1). Although the net reproductive 
rate (R0 = 17.63 offspring) was the lowest at 36°C, the values of r (0.0724 d-1) 
and λ (1.0751 d-1) were higher at 36°C than those at 21, 24, and 27°C. Our 
analysis for a mass-rearing system showed the most efficient and economical 
strategy would be to rear E. impressicornis at 30-33°C.

Working memory (WM), which underlies the temporary storage and manipulation of 
information, is critical for multiple aspects of cognition and everyday life. 
Nevertheless, research examining WM specifically in older adults remains 
limited, despite the global rapid increase in human life expectancy. We examined 
WM in a large sample ( N = 754) of healthy older adults (aged 58-89) in a 
non-Western population (Chinese speakers) in Taiwan, on a digit n-back task. We 
tested not only the influence of age itself and of load (1-back vs. 2-back) but 
also the effects of both sex and education, which have been shown to modulate WM 
abilities. Mixed-effects regression revealed that, within older adulthood, age 
negatively impacted WM abilities (with linear, not nonlinear, effects), as did 
load (worse performance at 2-back). In contrast, education level was positively 
associated with WM. Moreover, both age and education interacted with sex. With 
increasing age, males showed a steeper WM decline than females; with increasing 
education, females showed greater WM gains than males. Together with other 
findings, the evidence suggests that age, sex, and education all impact WM in 
older adults, but interact in particular ways. The results have both basic 
research and translational implications and are consistent with particular 
benefits from increased education for women.

BACKGROUND: This paper provides empirical evidence on how the relationship 
between health expenditure and health outcomes varies across countries at 
different income levels.
METHOD: Heterogeneity and cross-section dependence were controlled for in the 
panel data which consist of 161 countries over the period 1995-2014. Infant, 
under-five and maternal mortality along with life expectancy at birth were 
selected as health outcome measures. Cross-sectional augmented IPS unit root, 
panel autoregressive distributed lag, Dumitrescu-Hurlin and Toda-Yamamoto 
approach to Granger causality tests were used to investigate the relationship 
across four income groups. An impulse response function modelled the impact on 
health outcomes of negative shocks to health expenditure.
RESULTS: The results indicate that the health expenditure and health outcome 
link is stronger for low-income compared to high-income countries. Moreover, 
rising health expenditure can reduce child mortality but has an insignificant 
relationship with maternal mortality at all income levels. Lower-income 
countries are more at risk of adverse impact on health because of negative 
shocks to health expenditure. Variations in child mortality are better explained 
by rising health expenditure than maternal mortality. However, the estimated 
results showed dissimilarity when different assumptions and methods were used.
CONCLUSION: The influence of health expenditure on health outcome varies 
significantly across different income levels except for maternal health. 
Policymakers should recognize that increasing spending has a minute potential to 
improve maternal health. Lastly, the results vary significantly due to income 
level, choice of assumptions (homogeneity, cross-section independence) and 
estimation techniques used. Therefore, findings of the cross-country panel 
studies should be interpreted with cautions.

BACKGROUND: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in September, 
2015, emphasise the link between health and economic development policies. 
Despite this link, and the multitude of targets and indicators in the SDGs and 
other initiatives, few monitoring tools explicitly incorporate measures of both 
health and economic status. Here we propose poverty-free life expectancy (PFLE) 
as a new metric that uses widely available data to provide a composite measure 
of population health and economic wellbeing.
METHODS: We developed a population-level measure of PFLE and computed this 
summary measure for 90 countries with available data. Specifically, we used 
Sullivan's method, as in many health expectancy measures, to incorporate the 
prevalence of poverty by age and sex from household economic surveys into 
demographic life tables based on mortality rates from the 2015 Global Burden of 
Disease Study (GBD). For comparison, we also recalculated all PFLE measures 
using life tables from WHO and the UN. PFLE estimates for each country, 
stratified by sex, are the average number of poverty-free years a person could 
expect to live if exposed to current mortality rates and poverty prevalence in 
that country.
FINDINGS: The average PFLE in the 90 countries included in this study was 66·0 
years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 64·5-67·3) for females and 61·6 years 
(60·1-62·9) for males, whereas life expectancy estimates were 76·3 years (95% UI 
74·0-78·2) for females and 71·0 years (68·7-73·0) for males. PFLE varied widely 
between countries, ranging from 9·9 years (95% UI 9·1-10·5) for both sexes 
combined in Malawi, to 83·2 years (83·0-83·5) in Iceland, the latter differing 
only marginally from life expectancy in that country. In 67 of 90 countries, the 
difference between life expectancy and PFLE was greater for females than for 
males, indicating that women generally live more years of life in poverty than 
men do. Results were consistent when using GBD, WHO, or UN life tables.
INTERPRETATION: Differences in PFLE between countries are substantially greater 
than differences in life expectancy. Despite general improvements in survival in 
most regions of the world in the past decades, the focus in the SDG era on 
ending poverty brings into sharp relief the importance of ensuring that years of 
added life are lived with at least a minimum standard of economic wellbeing. 
Although summary measures of population health provide overall measures of 
survivorship and functional health, our new measure of PFLE provides 
complementary information that can inform and benchmark policies seeking to 
improve both health and economic wellbeing.

Needle aponeurotomy is an effective, minimally invasive treatment for 
metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joint contractures caused by Dupuytren 
disease. Multiple joints and digits can be safely treated in 1 session. Needle 
aponeurotomy is more cost-effective and has a significantly lower complication 
rate compared with open fasciectomy and collagenase injections. Recurrence rates 
are higher compared with open fasciectomy and collagenase injections. Patient 
satisfaction rates are high following needle aponeurotomy; the single clinic 
visit required and the minimal downtime after treatment are advantages unique to 
this procedure compared with other treatment modalities, including open 
fasciectomy, dermatofasciectomy, collagenase injections, and lipofilling.

PURPOSE: SelectMDx (MDxHealth®) is a panel of urinary biomarkers used in 
conjunction with traditional risk factors to individualize risk prediction for 
clinically significant prostate cancer. In this study we sought to characterize 
the effectiveness of SelectMDx in a population of American men with elevated 
prostate specific antigen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov decision analytical model to 
simulate the chain of events and downstream outcomes associated with ultrasound 
guided prostate biopsy and a strategy in which the biomarker panel is 
implemented prior to biopsy. The primary outcome was health outcomes, measured 
in QALYs (quality-adjusted life years). The secondary outcome was health care 
costs from the Medicare payer perspective. Multiple 1-way sensitivity analyses 
were performed to characterize model robustness.
RESULTS: The expected mean QALYs per patient under the current standard was 
10.796 at a cost of $11,060 during an 18-year horizon. Incorporating the urinary 
biomarker panel resulted in an expected mean of 10.841 QALYs per patient and a 
mean cost of $9,366, representing an average of 0.045 QALYs gained at a cost 
savings of $1,694 per patient. When extrapolating these data to a conservative 
estimate of 311,879 men per year undergoing biopsy, one would expect that the 
biomarker panel would result in an incremental 14,035 QALYs gained at a cost 
savings of $528,323,026 in each yearly cohort. The biomarker panel strategy 
dominated the current standard across a wide range of sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of the SelectMDx urinary biomarker panel to guide 
biopsy decision making improved health outcomes and lowered costs in American 
men at risk for prostate cancer. This strategy may optimize the value of 
prostate cancer risk assessment in an era of increasing financial 
accountability.

Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash Univeristy, Melbourne, Victoria,

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the impact of smoking on productivity in 
Australia, in terms of years of life lost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
lost and the novel measure of productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) lost.
METHODS: Life table modelling using contemporary Australian data simulated 
follow-up of current smokers aged 20-69 years until age 70 years. Excess 
mortality, health-related quality of life decrements and relative reduction in 
productivity attributable to smoking were sourced from published data. The gross 
domestic product (GDP) per equivalent full-time (EFT) worker in Australia in 
2016 was used to estimate the cost of productivity loss attributable to smoking 
at a population level.
RESULTS: At present, approximately 2.5 million Australians (17.4%) aged between 
20 and 69 years are smokers. Assuming follow-up of this population until the age 
of 70 years, more than 3.1 million years of life would be lost to smoking, as 
well as 6.0 million QALYs and 2.5 million PALYs. This equates to 4.2% of years 
of life, 9.4% QALYs and 6.0% PALYs lost among Australian working-age smokers. At 
an individual level, this is equivalent to 1.2 years of life, 2.4 QALYs and 1.0 
PALY lost per smoker. Assuming (conservatively) that each PALY in Australia is 
equivalent to $A157 000 (GDP per EFT worker in 2016), the economic impact of 
lost productivity would amount to $A388 billion.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential health and productivity gains 
that may be achieved from further tobacco control measures in Australia via 
application of PALYs, which are a novel, and readily estimable, measure of the 
impact of health and health risk factors on work productivity.

INTRODUCTION: It is predicted that with increased life expectancy in the whole 
world, there will be a greater demand for synthetic biomedical materials to 
repair or regenerate lost, injured or diseased tissues. Natural polymers, as 
biomedical materials, have been widely applied in the field of regenerative 
medicine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: By incorporation of nanoporous diopside bioglass (nDPB) 
into glia-din (GL) matrix, macro-nanoporous scaffolds of nDPB/GL composites 
(DGC) were fabricated by method of solution compressing and particles leaching.
RESULTS: The results revealed that the DGC scaffolds possessed 
well-interconnected macropores of 200-500 μm and nanopores of 4 nm, and the 
porosity and degradability of DGC scaffolds remarkably increased with the 
increase in nDPB content. In addition, in vitro cell experiments revealed that 
the adhesion and growth of MC3T3-E1 cells on DGC scaffolds were significantly 
promoted, which depended on nDPB content. Moreover, the results of histological 
evaluations confirmed that the osteogenic properties and degradability of DGC 
scaffolds in vivo significantly improved, which were nDPB content dependent. 
Furthermore, the results of immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that, with 
the increase in nDPB content, the type I collagen expression in DGC scaffolds in 
vivo obviously enhanced, indicating excellent osteogenesis.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the DGC scaffolds 
containing 30 wt% nDPB (30nDGC) exhibited good biocompatibility and new bone 
formation ability, which might have a great potential for applications in bone 
regeneration.

Background: This study investigated the effect of volume-matched strength 
training programs with different frequency and subsequent detraining on muscle 
size and strength. Methods: During a training period of 11 weeks, untrained 
subjects (age: 22.3 ± 0.9 years, height: 173.1 ± 4.8 cm and body mass: 66.8 ± 
8.4 kg) performed knee-extension exercise at 67% of their estimated 
one-repetition maximum either one session per week (T1 group: 6 sets of 12 
repetitions per session; n = 10) or three sessions per week (T3 group: 2 sets of 
12 repetitions per session; n = 10). Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and 
muscle stiffness were measured as an index of muscle fatigue and muscle damage, 
respectively. The magnitude of muscle hypertrophy was assessed with thigh 
circumference and the quadriceps muscle thickness. The changes in muscle 
strength were measured with isometric maximum voluntary contraction torque 
(MVC). Results: During the training period, RPE was significantly higher in the 
T1 than in the T3 (p < 0.001). After 11 weeks of training, both groups exhibited 
significant improvements in thigh circumference, muscle thickness, and MVC 
compared with baseline values. However, there was a significant group difference 
in MVC improvement at week 11 (T1: 43.5 ± 15.5%, T3: 65.2 ± 23.2%, p < 0.05). 
After 6 weeks of detraining, both groups showed the significant decreases in 
thigh circumference and muscle thickness from those at the end of training 
period, while no significant effect of detraining was observed in MVC. 
Conclusion: These results suggest that three training sessions per week with two 
sets are recommended for untrained subjects to improve muscle strength while 
minimizing fatigue compared to one session per week with six sets.

Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) are central to healthcare decision-making in 
Britain and abroad, yet their history is poorly understood. In this paper, we 
argue that a more in-depth and political history of the QALY is needed to allow 
a critical evaluation of its current dominance. Exploiting rich data from 
archives and 44 semi-structured interviews conducted between 2015 and 2018, we 
employ Multiple Streams Analysis to construct a complex and dynamic picture of 
how the idea of QALYs emerged and was adopted within UK health policy. Through 
its historical and political approach, the paper illuminates the relative roles 
in the policy-making process of experts (especially economists) and politicians 
as 'entrepreneurs' in the development of new ideas; how these were influenced by 
negotiation within established and emerging institutional structures; and the 
role of serendipity and crisis.

Small-cell prostate carcinoma (SCPC) is an aggressive malignancy that is managed 
similarly to small-cell lung cancer. SCPC can evolve from prostate 
adenocarcinoma in response to androgen deprivation therapy, but, in rare cases, 
is present at initial cancer diagnosis. The molecular aetiology of de novo SCPC 
is incompletely understood, owing to the scarcity of tumour tissue and the short 
life-expectancy of patients. Through a retrospective search of our regional 
oncology pharmacy database, we identified 18 patients diagnosed with de novo 
SCPC between 2004 and 2017. Ten patients had pure SCPC pathology, and the 
remainder had some admixed adenocarcinoma foci, but all were treated with 
first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The median overall survival was 
28 months. We performed targeted DNA sequencing, whole exome sequencing and mRNA 
profiling on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tumour tissue. We 
observed frequent biallelic deletion and/or mutation of the tumour suppressor 
genes TP53, RB1, and PTEN, similarly to what was found in treatment-related 
SCPC. Indeed, at the RNA level, pure de novo SCPC closely resembled 
treatment-related SCPC. However, five patients had biallelic loss of DNA repair 
genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and MSH2/6, potentially underlying the high 
genomic instability of this rare disease variant. Two patients with pure de novo 
SCPC harboured ETS gene rearrangements involving androgen-driven promoters, 
consistent with the evolution of de novo SCPC from an androgen-driven ancestor. 
Overall, our results reveal a highly aggressive molecular landscape that 
underlies this unusual pathological variant, and suggest opportunities for 
targeted therapy strategies in a disease with few treatment options. Copyright ©

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the last 40 years, with a better understanding of cardiac 
defects, and with the improved results of cardiac surgery, the life expectancy 
of persons with Down syndrome has significantly increased. This review article 
reports on advances in knowledge of cardiac defects and cardiovascular system of 
persons with trisomy 21.
RECENT FINDINGS: New insights into the genetics of this syndrome have improved 
our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiac defects. Recent 
changes in neonatal prevalence of Down syndrome suggest a growing number of 
children with cardiac malformations, in particular with simple types of defects. 
Ethnic and sex differences of the prevalence of specific types of congenital 
heart disease (CHD) have also been underlined. A recent study confirmed that 
subclinical morphologic anomalies are present in children with trisomy 21, also 
in the absence of cardiac defects, representing an internal stigma of Down 
syndrome. The results of cardiac surgery are significantly improved in terms of 
immediate and long-term outcomes, but specific treatments are indicated in 
relation to pulmonary hypertension. Particular aspects of the cardiovascular 
system have been described, clarifying a reduced sympathetic response to stress 
but also a 'protection' from atherosclerosis and arterial hypertension in these 
patients.
SUMMARY: Continuing dedication to clinical and basic research studies is 
essential to further improve survival and the quality of life from childhood to 
adulthood of patients with trisomy 21.

AIMS: Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have consistently demonstrated 
superior efficacy in terms of stroke prevention and safety in terms of bleeding 
over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation (AF). The potential use of NOACs in AF patients requiring 
antiplatelet therapy (APT) has only been assessed in small meta-analyses 
reporting consistent benefits of NOACs over VKAs. However, the prescription 
costs of NOACs are higher than those of VKAs. The aim of his study was to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness (CE) of NOACs compared to VKAs in patients with 
non-valvular AF also requiring APT with the Dutch healthcare system used as a 
surrogate of many European healthcare systems.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision tree was constructed to analyse the CE of NOACs 
compared to VKAs in patients with non-valvular AF with an indication for APT 
over a horizon of 1 year. Beside the base-case analysis, univariate 
probabilistic sensitivity and two sensitivity analyses were performed: first, we 
assessed the impact of VKA home monitoring; second, we varied the NOACs price 
assuming patent expiration. Use of NOACs instead of VKA is associated with a 
health gain of 0.0171 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and with an 
incremental cost of €357, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of €20 919, which is almost equal to the generally accepted CE threshold of 
€20 000 used in the Netherlands. The probability that NOACs are cost-effective 
at a conservative willingness-to-pay threshold of €20 000 per QALY was 50%. 
Introducing home monitoring increased VKAs costs so much that NOACs became the 
dominant option (less costly and more effective). Price drops associated to 
patent expiration of NOACs increased its CE.
CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that the use of NOACs is a cost-effective 
alternative of VKAs in patients with AF needing APT. Our findings in the 
Netherlands healthcare system are probably consistent with other European 
populations.

Recombinant albumin-drug genetic fusions are an effective technology to prolong 
the serum half-life of therapeutics that has resulted in marketed products. 
Indirect evidence suggests albumin fusions' long circulation is controlled by 
engagement with the cellular recycling neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in addition 
to reduced kidney filtration. In this work, we have used a panel of recombinant 
fusions, engineered with different human FcRn (hFcRn) affinity, including a 
novel high binding albumin variant (HBII), to directly define and importantly, 
control the intracellular mechanism as a half-life extension tuning method. 
mNeonGreen or mCherry fusion to the N-terminal of the recombinant human albumin 
(rHA) variants null-binder (rHA NB), wild-type (rHA WT), high-binder I (rHA 
HBI), and high-binder II (rHA HBII) did not generally interfere with hFcRn 
interaction determined by Biolayer Interferometry. Co-localisation of the 
albumins with endosomal, but not lysosomal, markers was shown by confocal 
microscopy for high, but not low, hFcRn binders in a human microvascular 
endothelial hFcRn overexpressing cell line (HMEC-1 FcRn) suggestive of endosomal 
compartmentalisation. Furthermore, a cellular recycling assay revealed increased 
recycling of albumin fusions for the high binding variants (mNeonGreen WT; ~1, 
mNeonGreen HBI; 5.26-fold higher, and mNeonGreen HBII; 5.77-fold higher) in the 
hFcRn overexpressing cell line. In vivo experiments demonstrated a direct in 
vitro recycling/in vivo half-life correlation with a longer circulation for the 
mCherry fusions engineered with high hFcRn affinity that was highest with the 
HBII variant of 30.1 h compared to 18.2 h for the mCherry WT. This work gives 
the first direct evidence for an FcRn-driven endosomal cellular recycling 
pathway for recombinant albumin fusions that correlates with half-life extension 
controlled by the affinity to hFcRn; promoting a versatile method to tune the 
pharmacokinetics of albumin fusion-based therapeutics not met by current 
technologies.
