The soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein produce several biological activities 
related to health benefits. A number of isoflavone extracts are commercially 
available, but there is little information concerning the specific isoflavone 
content of these products or differences in their bioavailability and 
pharmacokinetics. This study describes the development and validation of an 
analytical method to detect and quantify daidzein, genistein, and equol in human 
plasma using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS). The method was applied in a crossover, randomized, bioavailability 
study. Twelve healthy volunteers were administered the same total isoflavones 
dose from two isoflavone supplement preparations (Super-Absorbable Soy 
Isoflavones (Life Extension, USA) and Fitoladius (Merck, Spain)). The 
pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-24/dose and Cmax/dose) of the isoflavones from 
the two preparations differed significantly. Such differences in bioavailability 
and kinetics may have relevant effects on the health benefits derived from their 
intake.

INTRODUCTION: Only 30-40% of depressed patients treated with medication achieve 
full remission. Studies that change medication or augment it by psychotherapy 
achieve only limited benefits, in part because current treatments are not 
designed for chronic and complex patients. Previous trials have excluded 
high-risk patients and those with comorbid personality disorder. Radically Open 
Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (RO-DBT) is a novel, transdiagnostic treatment for 
disorders of emotional over-control. The REFRAMED trial aims to evaluate the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RO-DBT for patients with 
treatment-resistant depression.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: REFRAMED is a multicentre randomised controlled trial, 
comparing 7 months of individual and group RO-DBT treatment with treatment as 
usual (TAU). Our primary outcome measure is depressive symptoms 12 months after 
randomisation. We shall estimate the cost-effectiveness of RO-DBT by cost per 
quality-adjusted life year. Causal analyses will explore the mechanisms by which 
RO-DBT is effective.

Transition: the experiences of support workers caring for people with learning 
disabilities towards the end of life.

AIM: This research aims to provide a better understanding of the experience of 
support workers, as paid carers, caring for adults with learning disabilities 
(LDs) nearing the end of life in residential settings.
BACKGROUND: In the past 100 years, people with LDs (also referred to as 
'learning difficulty', 'mental retardation' and 'intellectual disability' 
internationally) are living longer with life expectancy approaching the 
population norm and more likely to die from diseases such as cancer, respiratory 
and vascular diseases. Community-based supported accommodation has become the 
foremost provider for people with LDs in their late 30 s or over in the UK. In 
the midst of the transition from living to dying for people with LDs, and even 
postdeath, the needs of support workers are often neglected against a background 
where most are unqualified, often with little experience of death and dying 
event, and with limited access to clinical supervision and education.
METHODS: 3 focus groups involving 13 support workers were conducted at 3 
independent service provider settings for people with LDs in London.
FINDINGS: In recounting the experiences of these groups of support workers, 6 
themes are described: strong emotional bond and identification; collaboration 
with other services; training issues around the extended role; support within 
the organisation; relationship with family/other residents; and grieving the 
'loss'.
CONCLUSIONS: Although support workers play a key role in meeting the end-of-life 
care needs of people with LDs in residential settings, their own needs are often 
neglected. There are still significant gaps in understanding these needs and 
practice development in this area.

University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether shared medical appointments (SMAs) for 
neuromuscular patients represent a way of using clinicians' time efficiently 
without compromising quality of care for patients.
METHODS: Patients with a chronic neuromuscular disease (NMD) (n = 272) were 
randomly allocated to either an SMA or a regular individual annual appointment 
and followed up for a period of 6 months. Data on resource utilization and 
quality of life (EQ-5D) were collected prospectively, using a health care 
perspective. Incremental costs and changes in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were computed using a probabilistic decision model. Factors critical to 
the incremental cost-effectiveness of SMAs were explored in sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: No substantial differences between SMAs and individual visits in terms 
of costs per QALY were found (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio €-960.00; 95% 
confidence interval €-34,600.00, €+36,800.00). Sensitivity analyses showed that 
the cost-effectiveness ratio was particularly sensitive to SMA group size and 
proportion of patients seeing their treating neurologist.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of SMAs did not show a significant difference vs 
that of individual appointments based on data from our randomized controlled 
trial. On the other hand, we were able to show that a minimum of 6 patients per 
SMA and 75% of patients attending their treating neurologist are specific 
conditions under which SMAs qualify as a cost-effective alternative. This 
implies that SMAs may be a means to increase productivity of the physician 
without compromising quality of care.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that SMAs are 
not significantly more cost-effective than individual appointments for patients 
with NMDs. The study lacks the precision to exclude important differences in 
cost-effectiveness between SMAs and individual appointments.

BACKGROUND: People with borderline personality disorder (BPD) experience rapid 
and distressing changes in mood, poor social functioning and have high rates of 
suicidal behaviour. Several small scale studies suggest that mood stabilizers 
may produce short-term reductions in symptoms of BPD, but have not been large 
enough to fully examine clinical and cost-effectiveness.
METHODS/DESIGN: A two parallel-arm, placebo controlled randomized trial of usual 
care plus either lamotrigine or an inert placebo for people aged over 18 who are 
using mental health services and meet diagnostic criteria for BPD. We will 
exclude people with comorbid bipolar affective disorder or psychosis, those 
already taking a mood stabilizer, those who speak insufficient English to 
complete the baseline assessment and women who are pregnant or contemplating 
becoming pregnant. Those meeting inclusion criteria and provide written informed 
consent will be randomized to up to 200mg of lamotrigine per day or an inert 
placebo (up to 400mg if taking combined oral contraceptives). Participants will 
be randomized via a remote web-based system using permuted stacked blocks 
stratified by study centre, severity of personality disorder, and level of 
bipolarity. Follow-up assessments will be conducted by masked researchers 12, 24 
weeks, and 52 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome is the Zanarini 
Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD). The secondary 
outcomes are depressive symptoms, deliberate self-harm, social functioning, 
health-related quality of life, resource use and costs, side effects of 
treatment, adverse events and withdrawal of trial medication due to adverse 
effects. The main analyses will use intention to treat without imputation of 
missing data. The economic evaluation will take an NHS/Personal Social Services 
perspective. A cost-utility analysis will compare differences in total costs and 
differences in quality of life using QALYs derived from the EQ-5D.
DISCUSSION: The evidence base for the use of pharmacological treatments for 
people with borderline personality disorder is poor. In this trial we will 
examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of lamotrigine to assess what if any 
impact offering this has on peoples' mental health, social functioning, and use 
of other medication and other resources.

Obesity is a major public health problem, with a prevalence of 10% to 20% in 
Western Europe. Morbid obesity, characterized by body mass index >40 kg/m(2), 
showed an increased prevalence in the last 30 years. Obesity is associated with 
reduced economic and social opportunities, reduced quality of life, and is a 
determinant of several "intermediate risk factors," leading to an increased 
mortality and a loss in life expectancy. The rising prevalence of morbid obesity 
increased the demand for bariatric surgery, also called "metabolic surgery": 
after these interventions, there is a decrease in metabolic comorbidities, 
cardiovascular (CV) risk, and total mortality. In this review, we update the 
evaluation of morbid obese patients from the physical examination to the 
metabolic, CV and respiratory assessments in order to correctly stratify the CV 
risk and provide the best treatment. To obtain these achievements, 
multidisciplinary work has to be carried out with a team involving several 
experts with different skills.

PURPOSE: To identify risk factors for late in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) 
dislocation and estimate the incidence of this condition over a 21-year period.
SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, County Hospital of Värmland, Karlstad, 
Sweden.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study and nested case-control study.
METHODS: The medical records of eyes operated on for late in-the-bag IOL 
dislocation between 1992 and 2012 were reviewed. The annual incidence and 
cumulative risk were calculated.
RESULTS: Of 140 eyes whose records were reviewed, 123 qualified for comparison 
(24 variables) with an equal number in a control group. The annual incidence 
varied between 0.00% and 0.08%. An increasing trend was found (P < .001). The 
cumulative risk 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after cataract extraction was 0.09%, 
0.55%, 1.00%, and 1.00%, respectively, and was significantly higher (P < .001) 
in eyes that had cataract surgery between 2002 and 2012 than in those operated 
on between 1992 and 2001 (0.89% versus 0.39% at 10 years postoperatively) (P < 
.001). Calendar time (date) of dislocation was positively correlated with the 
duration of preceding pseudophakia (P = .005). Phacoemulsification time was 
longer in eyes with dislocation than in control eyes (P < .001). Other 
identified risk factors were pseudoexfoliation, zonular dehiscence, 
pseudophacodonesis, and increased axial length.
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing number of late in-the-bag IOL dislocations cannot be 
explained by the growing pseudophakic population only. The increase in the 
incidence was due primarily to the longer duration of pseudophakia in the 
population and to a greater dislocation risk with recent cataract surgery. The 
increase in life expectancy played a minor role. Long phacoemulsification time 
was a risk factor for dislocation.

BACKGROUND: Indigenous Canadians have a life expectancy 12 years lower than the 
national average and experience higher rates of preventable chronic diseases 
compared with non-Indigenous Canadians. Transgenerational trauma from past 
assimilation policies have affected the health of Indigenous populations.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively examine the social 
determinants of health (SDH), in order to identify priorities for health 
promotion policies and actions.
DESIGN: We undertook a series of systematic reviews focusing on four major SDH 
(i.e. income, education, employment, and housing) among Indigenous peoples in 
Alberta, following the protocol Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analysis-Equity.
RESULTS: We found that the four SDH disproportionately affect the health of 
Indigenous peoples. Our systematic review highlighted 1) limited information 
regarding relationships and interactions among income, personal and social 
circumstances, and health outcomes; 2) limited knowledge of factors contributing 
to current housing status and its impacts on health outcomes; and 3) the limited 
number of studies involving the barriers to, and opportunities for, education.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may help to inform efforts to promote health equity 
and improve health outcomes of Indigenous Canadians. However, there is still a 
great need for in-depth subgroup studies to understand SDH (e.g. age, Indigenous 
ethnicity, dwelling area, etc.) and intersectoral collaborations (e.g. community 
and various government departments) to reduce health disparities faced by 
Indigenous Canadians.

This study evaluated the efficacy of thermosonication combined with slightly 
acidic electrolyzed water (SAcEW) on the shelf life extension of fresh-cut kale 
during storage at 4 and 7 °C. Each kale (10 ± 0.2 g) was inoculated to contain 
approximately 6 log CFU/g of Listeria monocytogenes. Each inoculated or 
uninoculated samples was dip treated at 40 °C for 3 min with deionized water, 
thermosonication (400 W/L), SAcEW (5 mg/L), sodium chlorite (SC; 100 mg/L), 
sodium hypochlorite (SH; 100 mg/L), and thermosonication combined with SAcEW, 
SC, and SH (TS + SAcEW, TS + SC, and TS + SH, respectively). Growths of L. 
monocytogenes and spoilage microorganisms and changes in sensory (overall visual 
quality, browning, and off-odour) were evaluated. The results show that lag time 
and specific growth rate of each microorganism were not significantly (P > 0.05) 
affected by treatment and storage temperature. Exceeding the unacceptable counts 
of spoilage microorganisms did not always result in adverse effects on sensory 
attributes. This study suggests that TS + SAcEW was the most effective method to 
prolong the shelf life of kale with an extension of around 4 and 6 days at 4 and 
7 °C, respectively, and seems to be a promising method for the shelf life 
extension of fresh produce.

The entropy of the life table: A reappraisal.

The life table entropy provides useful information for understanding 
improvements in mortality and survival in a population. In this paper we take a 
closer look at the life table entropy and use advanced mathematical methods to 
provide additional insights for understanding how it relates to changes in 
mortality and survival. By studying the entropy (H) as a functional, we show 
that changes in the entropy depend on both the relative change in life 
expectancy lost due to death (e(†)) and in life expectancy at birth (e0). We 
also show that changes in the entropy can be further linked to improvements in 
premature and older deaths. We illustrate our methods with empirical data from 
Latin American countries, which suggests that at high mortality levels declines 
in H (which are associated with survival increases) linked with larger 
improvements in e0, whereas at low mortality levels e(†) made larger 
contributions to H. We additionally show that among countries with low mortality 
level, contributions of e(†) to changes in the life table entropy resulted from 
averting early deaths. These findings indicate that future increases in overall 
survival in low mortality countries will likely result from improvements in 
e(†).

Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS, MIM #269150) is a rare syndrome characterized by 
severe intellectual disability, typical facial gestalt, hypertrichosis and 
multiple congenital malformations including skeletal, genitourinary, renal and 
cardiac abnormalities. The prognosis of SGS is very severe and death occurs 
generally within a few years after birth. In 2002, we reported 2 children with 
SGS with a follow-up of 3 years. They presented a very similar and particular 
phenotype associating distinctive facial gestalt, severe developmental delay, 
megacalycosis, progressive neurodegeneration, alacrimi, corneal hypoesthesia and 
deafness. Furthermore, temporal bone imaging revealed a tuning-fork malformation 
of the stapes. In 2010, Hoischen et al. identified in SGS patients pathogenic 
heterozygous de novo mutations in SETBP1. We sequenced SETBP1 in our patients 
and found the previously reported c.2608G>A (p.Gly870Ser) mutation in both 
children. Since 2002, one of our patients died at 6 years old and the other 
patient is still alive at 15 years old. Such a life expectancy has never been 
reported so far. We describe herein the follow up of the 2 children during 6 and 
15 years respectively. This article gives further evidence of the implication of 
SETBP1 as the major gene of SGS, and reports the previously unseen natural 
evolution of the disease in a 15 years old patient.

Efficient communication of a clinical study protocol and case report forms 
during all stages of a human clinical study is important for many stakeholders. 
An electronic and structured study representation format that can be used 
throughout the whole study life-span can improve such communication and 
potentially lower total study costs. The most relevant standard for representing 
clinical study data, applicable to unregulated as well as regulated studies, is 
the Operational Data Model (ODM) in development since 1999 by the Clinical Data 
Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). ODM's initial objective was exchange 
of case report forms data but it is increasingly utilized in other contexts. An 
ODM extension called Study Design Model, introduced in 2011, provides additional 
protocol representation elements. Using a case study approach, we evaluated 
ODM's ability to capture all necessary protocol elements during a complete 
clinical study lifecycle in the Intramural Research Program of the National 
Institutes of Health. ODM offers the advantage of a single format for 
institutions that deal with hundreds or thousands of concurrent clinical studies 
and maintain a data warehouse for these studies. For each study stage, we 
present a list of gaps in the ODM standard and identify necessary vendor or 
institutional extensions that can compensate for such gaps. The current version 
of ODM (1.3.2) has only partial support for study protocol and study 
registration data mainly because it is outside the original development goal. 
ODM provides comprehensive support for representation of case report forms (in 
both the design stage and with patient level data). Inclusion of requirements of 
observational, non-regulated or investigator-initiated studies (outside Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) regulation) can further improve future revisions of 
the standard.

Cytokines and chemokines regulate many functions in the body including the 
brain. The interactions between adipose tissue and the central nervous system 
(CNS) are important for the regulation of energy balance. CNS function is also 
influenced by age. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects 
of body mass index (BMI) and age on cytokine and chemokine levels in 
cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid samples (n=89) were collected from 
patients undergoing routine surgical procedures. The samples were analyzed using 
the multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA) in which 92 different cytokines 
are measured simultaneously using minute sample volume. We found no significant 
correlations between age and cytokine levels for any of the studied markers. In 
contrast, at a false discovery rate of 10%, 19 markers were significantly 
associated with BMI (in decreasing significance: FGF-5, ADA, Beta-NGF, CD40, 
IL-10RB, CCL19, TGF-alpha, SIRT2, TWEAK, SCF, CSF-1, 4E-BP1, DNER, LIF-R, 
STAMPB, CXCL10, CXCL6, VEGF-A and CX3CL1). This study reveals a clear effect of 
BMI on cytokine and chemokine levels in cerebrospinal fluid.

The decline in Avoidable Mortality (AM) and increase in life expectancy in 
Shanghai is impressive. Gusmano and colleagues suggested that Shanghai's 
improved health system has contributed significantly to this decline in AM. 
However, when compared to other global cities, Shanghai's life expectancy at 
birth is improving as London and New York City, but has yet to surpass that of 
Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Paris. Over the past decade, the reduction in AM of 
Shanghai is just in line with the international experience in reducing avoidable 
premature deaths. We suggest that a more elaborate research design is needed to 
examine the impact of the improvement in Shanghai's health system on its 
population health status.

How long should a patient with a treatable chronic disease wait for more 
effective treatments before accepting the best available treatment? We develop a 
framework to guide optimal treatment decisions for a deteriorating chronic 
disease when treatment technologies are improving over time. We formulate an 
optimal stopping problem using a discrete-time, finite-horizon Markov decision 
process. The goal is to maximize a patient's quality-adjusted life expectancy. 
We derive structural properties of the model and analytically solve a 
three-period treatment decision problem. We illustrate the model with the 
example of treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). Chronic HCV affects 
3-4 million Americans and has been historically difficult to treat, but 
increasingly effective treatments have been commercialized in the past few 
years. We show that the optimal treatment decision is more likely to be to 
accept currently available treatment-despite expectations for future treatment 
improvement-for patients who have high-risk history, who are older, or who have 
more comorbidities. Insights from this study can guide HCV treatment decisions 
for individual patients. More broadly, our model can guide treatment decisions 
for curable chronic diseases by finding the optimal treatment policy for 
individual patients in a heterogeneous population.

The discovery of bioactive molecules modulating aging in living organism 
promotes development of natural therapeutics for curing age-related afflictions. 
The progression in age-related disorders can be attributed to increment in 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress level. To this 
end, we isolated an iridoid verminoside (VMS) from Stereospermum suaveolens 
(Roxb.) DC. and evaluated its effect on Caenorhabditis elegans. The present 
study delineates VMS-mediated alteration of intracellular ROS, oxidative stress, 
and life span in C. elegans. The different tested doses of VMS (5 μM, 25 μM, and 
50 μM) were able to enhance ROS scavenging and extend mean life span in C. 
elegans. The maximal life span extension was observed in 25 μM VMS, that is, 
20.79% (P < 0.0001) followed by 9.84% (P < 0.0001) in 5 μM VMS and 8.54% (P < 
0.0001) in 50 μM VMS. VMS was able to alleviate juglone-induced oxidative stress 
and enhanced thermotolerance in worms. The stress-modulating and ROS-scavenging 
potential of VMS was validated by increment in mean survival by 29.54% (P < 
0.0001) in VMS-treated oxidative stress hypersensitive mev-1 mutant strain. 
Furthermore, VMS modulates expression of DAF-16 (a FoxO transcription factor) 
promoting stress resistance and longevity. Altogether, our results suggest that 
VMS attenuates intracellular ROS and stress (oxidative and thermal) level 
promoting longevity. The longevity and stress modulation can be attributed to 
VMS-mediated alterations in daf-16 expression which regulates insulin signaling 
pathway. This study opens doors for development of phytomolecule-based 
therapeutics for prolonging life span and managing age-related severe disorders.

Transhumeral amputation has a significant effect on a person's independence and 
quality of life. Myoelectric prostheses have the potential to restore upper limb 
function, however their use is currently limited due to lack of intuitive and 
natural control of multiple degrees of freedom. The goal of this study was to 
evaluate a novel transhumeral prosthesis controller that uses a combination of 
kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from the person's 
proximal humerus. Specifically, we trained a time-delayed artificial neural 
network to predict elbow flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination from 
six proximal EMG signals, and humeral angular velocity and linear acceleration. 
We evaluated this scheme with ten able-bodied subjects offline, as well as in a 
target-reaching task presented in an immersive virtual reality environment. The 
offline training had a target of 4° for flexion/extension and 8° for 
pronation/supination, which it easily exceeded (2.7° and 5.5° respectively). 
During online testing, all subjects completed the target-reaching task with path 
efficiency of 78% and minimal overshoot (1.5%). Thus, combining kinematic and 
muscle activity signals from the proximal humerus can provide adequate 
prosthesis control, and testing in a virtual reality environment can provide 
meaningful data on controller performance.

The present study examined the effects of water extract of propolis on the 
chemical, microbiological and sensory quality in vacuum-packed fresh shibuta 
(Barbus grypus) fillets during storage at 2°C. Treatments in the study included 
the following: control (P0) without extract of propolis, 0.1 (P1), 0.3 (P3) and 
0.5 (P5) % (v/w) the water extract of propolis, respectively. After 24 days of 
storage, the total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) values were 57.76, 44.66, 
42.23 and 36.5mg/100g, and total viable counts (TVC) were 8.9, 8.3, 7.96 and 
6.95logcfu/g, for water extract of propolis additions of 0.1 (P1), 0.3 (P3), 0.5 
(P5) and 0 (control; P0) % (v/w), respectively. The highest acceptable TVB-N 
value was adopted as 30 mg/100g, corresponding to shelf lives of 9, 15, 18 and 
21 days for P0, P1, P3 and P5, respectively. Addition of 0.1% water extract of 
propolis extended the product's shelf-life by approximately 6 days, whereas the 
0.5% water extract of propolis resulted in a significant shelf-life extension of 
the shibuta fillets, i.e. by approximately 12 days, according to sensory data, 
as compared to the control sample.

Neglect of the complex: why psychotherapy for post-traumatic clinical 
presentations is often ineffective.

Corrigan FM(1), Hull AM(2).

Author information:

(2)Perth Royal Infirmary, Perth.

Evidence of efficacy in studies of post-traumatic conditions is largely derived 
from studies in which variables are kept to a minimum. Extrapolation of 
treatments from uncomplicated disorders to complex conditions may therefore be 
called evidence-based without being evidenced. Complex conditions with 
polysymptomatic presentations and extensive comorbidity are being denied proper 
evaluation, and patients most severely traumatised from the early stages of 
their development are not provided with rigorously evaluated psychotherapies 
because they are more difficult to study in the manner approved by research 
protocols. Such evidence as there is suggests that the simple extension of 
treatments for uncomplicated disorders is seriously inadequate. This has 
significant implications for health services responsible for the provision of 
the most efficacious treatments to those whose disorders arise from severe 
trauma, often very early in their life.

Nonthermal physical technologies to decontaminate and extend the shelf-life of 
fruits and vegetables: Trends aiming at quality and safety.

Minimally processed fruits and vegetables are one of the major growing sectors 
in food industry. This growing demand for healthy and convenient foods with 
fresh-like properties is accompanied by concerns surrounding efficacy of the 
available sanitizing methods to appropriately deal with food-borne diseases. In 
fact, chemical sanitizers do not provide an efficient microbial reduction, 
besides being perceived negatively by the consumers, dangerous for human health, 
and harmful to the environment, and the conventional thermal treatments may 
negatively affect physical, nutritional, or bioactive properties of these 
perishable foods. For these reasons, the industry is investigating alternative 
nonthermal physical technologies, namely innovative packaging systems, ionizing 
and ultraviolet radiation, pulsed light, high-power ultrasound, cold plasma, 
high hydrostatic pressure, and dense phase carbon dioxide, as well as possible 
combinations between them or with other preservation factors (hurdles). This 
review discusses the potential of these novel or emerging technologies for 
decontamination and shelf-life extension of fresh and minimally processed fruits 
and vegetables. Advantages, limitations, and challenges related to its use in 
this sector are also highlighted.

The patriarch hypothesis : An alternative explanation of menopause.

Marlowe F(1).

Author information:

Cambridge, MA. fmarlowe@fas.harvard.edu.

Menopause is puzzling because life-history theory predicts there should be no 
selection for outliving one's reproductive capacity. Adaptive explanations of 
menopause offered thus far turn on women's long-term investment in offspring and 
grandoffspring, all variations on the grandmother hypothesis. Here, I offer a 
very different explanation. The patriarch hypothesis proposes that once males 
became capable of maintaining high status and reproductive access beyond their 
peak physical condition, selection favored the extension of maximum life span in 
males. Because the relevant genes were not on the Y chromosome, life span 
increased in females as well. However, the female reproductive span was 
constrained by the depletion of viable oocytes, which resulted in menopause.

STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysisObjective:To establish a model to 
investigate the cost effectiveness for people with spinal cord injury (SCI), 
from a lifetime perspective, for the usage of two different single-use catheter 
designs: hydrophilic-coated (HC) and uncoated (UC). The model includes the 
long-term sequelae of impaired renal function and urinary tract infection (UTI).
SETTING: Analysis based on a UK perspective.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov decision model was constructed, to compare 
lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years, taking renal and UTI health 
states into consideration, as well as other catheter-related events. UTI event 
rates for the primary data set were based on data from hospital settings to 
ensure controlled and accurate reporting. A sensitivity analysis was applied to 
evaluate best- and worst-case scenarios.
RESULTS: The model predicts that a 36-year-old SCI patient with chronic urinary 
retention will live an additional 1.4 years if using HC catheters compared with 
UC catheters, at an incremental cost of £2100. Moreover, the lifetime number of 
UTI events will be reduced by 16%. All best- and worst-case estimates were 
within the UK threshold of being cost effective.
CONCLUSION: The use of HC catheters for intermittent catheterisation in SCI 
patients is highly cost effective. The outcome is consistent irrespective of 
whether UTI data are collected in hospital or community settings.
