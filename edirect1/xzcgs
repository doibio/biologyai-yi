likely to be cost-effective in this indication.
CONCLUSIONS: The conservative approach to the modelled evaluation, as well as 
results of the sensitivity analysis, demonstrates that ivabradine is a 
cost-effective treatment in the Australian setting for HF patients with a HR≥77 
bpm on optimal standard therapy with a cost per QALYG similar or lower than that 
for other publicly funded treatments.

OBJECTIVE: To undertake a cost-utility analysis of a motivational multicomponent 
lifestyle-modification intervention in a community setting (the Healthy Eating 
Lifestyle Programme (HELP)) compared with enhanced standard care.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Community settings in Greater London, England.
PARTICIPANTS: 174 young people with obesity aged 12-19 years.
INTERVENTIONS: Intervention participants received 12 one-to-one sessions across 
6 months, addressing lifestyle behaviours and focusing on motivation to change 
and self-esteem rather than weight change, delivered by trained graduate health 
workers in community settings. Control participants received a single 1-hour 
one-to-one nurse-delivered session providing didactic weight-management advice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per 
participant over a 1-year period using resource use data and utility values 
collected during the trial. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
calculated and non-parametric bootstrapping was conducted to generate a 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC).
RESULTS: Mean intervention costs per participant were £918 for HELP and £68 for 
enhanced standard care. There were no significant differences between the two 
groups in mean resource use per participant for any type of healthcare contact. 
Adjusted costs were significantly higher in the intervention group (mean 
incremental costs for HELP vs enhanced standard care £1003 (95% CI £837 to 
£1168)). There were no differences in adjusted QALYs between groups (mean QALYs 
gained 0.008 (95% CI -0.031 to 0.046)). The ICER of the HELP versus enhanced 
standard care was £120 630 per QALY gained. The CEAC shows that the probability 
that HELP was cost-effective relative to the enhanced standard care was 0.002 or 
0.046, at a threshold of £20 000 or £30 000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence that HELP was more effective than a single 
educational session in improving quality of life in a sample of adolescents with 
obesity. HELP was associated with higher costs, mainly due to the extra costs of 
delivering the intervention and therefore is not cost-effective.

INTRODUCTION: The holistic management of hearing loss (HL) requires an 
understanding of factors that predict hearing aid (HA) use and benefit beyond 
the acoustics of listening environments. Although several predictors have been 
identified, no study has explored the role of audiological, cognitive, 
behavioural and physiological data nor has any study collected real-time HA 
data. This study will collect 'big data', including retrospective HA logging 
data, prospective clinical data and real-time data via smart HAs, a mobile 
application and biosensors. The main objective is to enable the validation of 
the EVOTION platform as a public health policy-making tool for HL.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a big data international multicentre study 
consisting of retrospective and prospective data collection. Existing data from 
approximately 35 000 HA users will be extracted from clinical repositories in 
the UK and Denmark. For the prospective data collection, 1260 HA candidates will 
be recruited across four clinics in the UK and Greece. Participants will 
complete a battery of audiological and other assessments (measures of 
patient-reported HA benefit, mood, cognition, quality of life). Patients will be 
offered smart HAs and a mobile phone application and a subset will also be given 
wearable biosensors, to enable the collection of dynamic real-life HA usage 
data. Big data analytics will be used to detect correlations between 
contextualised HA usage and effectiveness, and different factors and 
comorbidities affecting HL, with a view to informing public health 
decision-making.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was received from the London South 
East Research Ethics Committee (17/LO/0789), the Hippokrateion Hospital Ethics 
Committee (1847) and the Athens Medical Center's Ethics Committee (KM140670). 
Results will be disseminated through national and international events in Greece 
and the UK, scientific journals, newsletters, magazines and social media. Target 
audiences include HA users, clinicians, policy-makers and the general public.

OBJECTIVE: The 2012 American College of Rheumatology gout management guidelines 
recommend monitoring serum urate (SU) every 6 months after target SU has been 
achieved. Our objective was to determine through modeling whether this testing 
would be cost-effective, considering financial cost, quality of life, and 
estimated change in adherence.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was completed with a 3-arm model: (1) no 
regular urate monitoring; (2) annual urate monitoring; and (3) biannual urate 
monitoring. Inputs to the model for health-related quality of life, flare rate, 
and treatment location were drawn from the medical literature and modeled over a 
lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: No monitoring was the least costly (Australian$6974) but least 
effective [13.51 quality-adjusted life-yrs (QALY)], while annual urate 
monitoring [A$7117; 13.53 QALY; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
A$13,678/QALY gained] and biannual monitoring [A$7298; 13.54 QALY; ICER A$15,420 
per QALY gained] were both cost-effective alternatives in base case analysis. 
Sensitivity analysis on both an individual component level and a probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) demonstrated that the result was robust to changes in 
input variables. An improvement in adherence of ≥ 3.5% with biannual monitoring 
was all that was required to demonstrate cost-effectiveness. In PSA, the 
probability of biannual monitoring was 78%, no monitoring was 20%, and annual 
monitoring was 2%.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that biannual SU monitoring after attaining 
target SU is the most cost-effective, compared with no testing and annual 
testing.

Global warming is causing a negative impact on plant growth and adversely 
impacts on crop yield. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical in regulating the 
expression of genes involved in plant development as well as defense responses. 
The effects of miRNAs on heat-stressed Arabidopsis warrants further 
investigation. Heat stress increased the expression of miR160 and its precursors 
but considerably reduced that of its targets, ARF10, ARF16, and ARF17. To study 
the roles of miR160 during heat stress, transgenic Arabidopsis plants 
overexpressing miR160 precursor a (160OE) and artificial miR160 (MIM160), which 
mimics an inhibitor of miR160, were created. T-DNA insertion mutants of miR160 
targets were also used to examine their tolerances to heat stress. Results 
presented that overexpressing miR160 improved seed germination and seedling 
survival under heat stress. The lengths of hypocotyl elongation and rachis were 
also longer in 160OE than the wild-type (WT) plants under heat stress. 
Interestingly, MIM160 plants showed worse adaption to heat. In addition, arf10, 
arf16, and arf17 mutants presented similar phenotypes to 160OE under heat stress 
to advance abilities of thermotolerance. Moreover, transcriptome and qRT-PCR 
analyses revealed that HSP17.6A, HSP17.6II, HSP21, and HSP70B expression levels 
were regulated by heat in 160OE, MIM160, arf10, arf16, and arf17 plants. Hence, 
miR160 altered the expression of the heat shock proteins and plant development 
to allow plants to survive heat stress.

OBJECTIVE: Dementia is the fourth most common cause of death in developed 
countries. The relationship between plasma lipids and cognitive function is 
complex and controversial. Due to the increasing life expectancy of the 
population, there is an urgent need to control vascular risk factors and to 
identify therapies to prevent and treat both cognitive impairment and dementia. 
Here, we reviewed the effects of plasma lipids and statins on cognitive 
function.
DATA SOURCES: We searched the PubMed database for research articles published 
through November 2017 with key words including "plasma lipids," 
"hyperlipidemia," "hypercholesterolemia," "statins," and "cognition function."
STUDY SELECTION: Articles were retrieved and reviewed to analyze the effects of 
plasma lipids and statins on cognitive function and the mechanisms underlying 
these effects.
RESULTS: Many studies have examined the relationship between plasma lipids and 
cognitive function, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn. The mechanisms 
involved may include blood-brain barrier injury, the influence on small blood 
vessels in the brain, the influence on amyloid deposition, and a neuroprotective 
effect. To date, most studies of statins and cognition have been observational, 
with few randomized controlled trials. Therefore, firm conclusions regarding 
whether mid- or long-term statin use affects cognition function and dementia 
remain elusive. However, increasing concern exists that statins may be a 
causative factor for cognitive problems. These adverse effects appear to be rare 
and likely represent a yet-to-be-defined vulnerability in susceptible 
individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between plasma lipids and cognition, the mechanism 
of the influence of plasma lipids on cognitive function, and the association 
between statins and cognitive function are complex issues and currently not 
fully understood. Future research aimed at identifying the mechanisms that 
underlie the effects of plasma lipids and statins on cognition will not only 
provide important insight into the causes and interdependencies of cognitive 
impairment and dementia, but also inspire novel strategies for treating and 
preventing these cognitive disorders.

Publisher: 血脂和他汀类药物对认知功能的影响 摘要 目的: 在发达国家, 痴呆被列为第四大常见死因。 血脂与认知功能之间的关系非常复杂和矛盾。 
由于预期寿命的增加, 迫切需要控制血管性危险因素, 寻找预防和治疗认知障碍和痴呆的治疗方法。 在这篇文章中, 我们回顾了血脂和他汀类药物对认知功能的影响。 
方法: 通过计算机检索 PubMed 数据库, 搜索 2017 年以前发表的文章, 
文章关键词为“血脂,”“高脂血症,”“高胆固醇血症,”“他汀类药物,”“认知功能。” 结果: 目前, 关于血脂和认知功能的研究很多, 但尚无定论, 
其机制可能是血脑屏障被破坏、影响脑小血管、影响淀粉样蛋白的沉积以及神经保护作用。 
迄今为止，大多数关于他汀类药物和认知功能的研究都是观察性研究，很少有随机对照试验。因此，关于中期或长期使用他汀类药物是否会改善认知功能和痴呆仍然难以确定，同时他汀类药物可能导致认知障碍的不良反应也不容忽视。这些不良反应非常罕见，且与个体易感性有关。 
结论: 血脂和认知功能、血脂影响认知功能可能的机制以及他汀类药物和认知功能的关系非常复杂，而且尚未有定论。 
未来的研究旨在确定血脂和他汀类药物对认知功能影响的机制，不仅将为认知障碍和痴呆的病因和相互关系提供重要见解，而且还将启发治疗和预防认知障碍的新策略。.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is a pathophysiological condition diffused in elderly 
people; it represents a social issue due to the longer life expectancy and the 
growing aging population. It affects negatively quality of life and it 
represents a risk factor for other pathologies, such as diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, and obesity. No silver bullet exists to hinder sarcopenia, but it may 
be counteracted by physical exercise, nutrition, and a proper endocrine milieu. 
Indeed, we aim to analyze the scientific literature to give to clinician 
effective advices to counteract sarcopenia. Main text: Physical exercise, proper 
nutrition, optimized hormonal homeostasis represent the three pillars to fight 
sarcopenia. Physical exercise represents the most effective remedy to face 
sarcopenia, in particular if it is combined with a proper diet and with an 
adequate endocrine milieu. Consistency in training, adequate daily protein 
intake and eugonadism seems to be the keys to fight sarcopenia. The combination 
of these three pillars might act synergistically.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimization of these factors may increase their efficiency; 
however, scientific data may be sometimes confusing so far. Therefore, we aim to 
give practical advices to clinician to identify and to highlight the most 
important aspects in each of these three factors that should be addressed.

OBJECTIVE Atlantoaxial instability is usually corrected by anterior and/or 
posterior C1-2 fusion. However, fusion can lead to considerable loss of movement 
at the C1-2 level, which can adversely impact a patient's quality of life. In 
this study, the authors investigated the stability and function of a novel 
posterior artificial atlanto-odontoid joint (NPAAJ) by using cadaveric cervical 
spines. METHODS The Oc-C7 regions from 10 cadaveric spines were used for 
anteroposterior (AP) translation and range of motion (ROM) tests while intact 
and after destabilization, NPAAJ implantation, and double-rod fixation. RESULTS 
The mean AP C1-2 translational distances in the intact, destabilization, and 
double-rod groups were 6.53 ± 1.07 mm, 11.54 ± 1.59 mm, and 3.24 ± 0.99 mm, 
respectively, and the AP translational distance in the NPAAJ group was 
significantly different from that in the intact group (p < 0.05). The AP 
translational distance in the NPAAJ group was not significantly different from 
that in the double-rod group (p = 0.24). The mean flexion, extension, and axial 
rotation ROM values of the NPAAJ group were 9.87° ± 0.91°, 8.75° ± 0.99°, and 
61.93° ± 2.93°, respectively, and these were lower than the corresponding values 
in the intact group (p < 0.05). The mean lateral bending ROM in the NPAAJ group 
(9.26° ± 0.86°) was not significantly different from that in the intact group (p 
= 0.23), and the flexion, extension, and rotation ranges in the NPAAJ group were 
79.5%, 85.2%, and 82.3%, respectively, of those in the intact group. CONCLUSIONS 
Use of NPAAJ for correction of atlantoaxial instability disorders caused by 
congenital odontoid dysplasia, odontoid fracture nonunion, and C-1 transverse 
ligament disruption (IA, IB, and IIB) may restore the stability and preserve 
most of the ROM of C1-2. Additionally, the NPAAJ may prevent soft tissue from 
embedding within the joint. However, additional studies should be performed 
before the NPAAJ is used clinically.

After the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, long-term epidemiological 
studies were undertaken on the irradiated survivors and their offspring, and are 
still underway. These thorough studies involving tens of thousands of persons 
and published in hundreds of papers have shown a moderate increase in cancer 
incidence for irradiated survivors, with limited impact on their life span (loss 
of one year at most). In studies on the offspring of these survivors, no 
statistically significant deleterious effect on malformation frequency, 
incidence of mutations or mortality from cancer and other diseases has been seen 
so far. These data are actually the basis for current radiation safety levels; 
they show that health risks from radiation are limited, but they are not 
applicable to complex situations such as nuclear power station accidents that 
involve diverse types of radiation as well as contamination by radioactive 
materials.

Aging is a modern concept: human life expectancy has more than doubled in less 
than 150 yr in Western countries. Longer life span, however, reveals age-related 
diseases, including cerebrovascular diseases. The vascular system is a prime 
target of aging: the "wear and tear" of large elastic arteries exposed to a 
lifelong pulsatile pressure causes arterial stiffening by fragmentation of 
elastin fibers and replacement by stiffer collagen. This arterial stiffening 
increases in return the amplitude of the pulse pressure (PP), its wave 
penetrating deeper into the microcirculation of low-resistance, high-flow organs 
such as the brain. Several studies have associated peripheral arterial stiffness 
responsible for the sustained increase in PP, with brain microvascular diseases 
such as cerebral small vessel disease, cortical gray matter thinning, white 
matter atrophy, and cognitive dysfunction in older individuals and prematurely 
in hypertensive and diabetic patients. The rarefaction of white matter is also 
associated with middle cerebral artery pulsatility that is strongly dependent on 
PP and artery stiffness. PP and brain damage are likely associated, but the 
sequence of mechanistic events has not been established. Elevated PP promotes 
endothelial dysfunction that may slowly develop in parallel with the 
accumulation of proinflammatory senescent cells and oxidative stress, generating 
cerebrovascular damage and remodeling, as well as brain structural changes. 
Here, we review data suggesting that age-related increased peripheral artery 
stiffness may promote the penetration of a high PP to cerebral microvessels, 
likely causing functional, structural, metabolic, and hemodynamic alterations 
that could ultimately promote neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Consensus guidelines for prosthesis selection in infective 
endocarditis recommend bioprosthetic or mechanical valve replacement based on 
life expectancy and comorbidity. However, contemporary outcome data are limited 
to institution series.
METHODS: The outcomes of 3,447 patients identified from mandatory discharge 
databases in California and New York who had either primary isolated mitral (n = 
1,603) or aortic (n = 1,844) valve replacement for active endocarditis between 
1998 and 2010 were compared according to whether they received bioprosthetic 
(n = 1,673, 48.5%) or mechanical (n = 1,774, 51.5%) valves. Drug abusers were 
analyzed as a separate cohort. The primary outcome was endocarditis recurrence. 
Median follow-up time was 6.8 years (range, 0 to 12). Last follow-up for 
survival was December 31, 2015.
RESULTS: Patients receiving bioprosthetic valves were older (60.4 ± 14.9 versus 
53.4 ± 14.3 years, p < 0.001), with more comorbidity. There was no significant 
difference in 12-year survival with bioprosthetic versus mechanical valves after 
mitral (adjusted hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98 to 1.34, 
p = 0.10) or aortic (adjusted hazard ratio 1.10, 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.29, p = 0.26) 
valve replacement. Bioprosthetic and mechanical valves were associated with 
similar recurrence rates at 12 years: 10.4% (95% CI: 8.0% to 13.1%) versus 8.8% 
(95% CI: 6.9% to 10.9%), adjusted Cox p = 0.79 after mitral replacement; and 
9.4% (95% CI: 7.5% to 11.6%) versus 10.0% (95% CI: 8.0% to 12.4%), adjusted Cox 
p = 0.81 after aortic valve replacement.
CONCLUSIONS: Bioprosthetic and mechanical valves are associated with similar 
survival and freedom from endocarditis recurrence. These data support guideline 
recommendations that patient factors guide prosthesis choice in infective 
endocarditis.

Health Care Efficiencies: Consolidation and Alternative Models vs. Health Care 
and Antitrust Regulation - Irreconcilable Differences?

King MW(1).

complex health care transactional and finance matters, including structuring 
joint ventures and management arrangements, mergers and acquisitions, and 
financing transactions. The author would like to thank Brownstein Shareholder 
Rich Benenson for his contributions on antitrust litigation, and Associate

Despite the U.S. substantially outspending peer high income nations with almost 
18% of GDP dedicated to health care, on any number of statistical measurements 
from life expectancy to birth rates to chronic disease, 1 the U.S. achieves 
inferior health outcomes. In short, Americans receive a very disappointing 
return on investment on their health care dollars, causing economic and social 
strain. 2 Accordingly, the debates rage on: what is the top driver of health 
care spending? Among the culprits: poor communication and coordination among 
disparate providers, paperwork required by payors and regulations, 
well-intentioned physicians overprescribing treatments, drugs and devices, 
outright fraud and abuse, and medical malpractice litigation. Fundamentally, 
what is the best way to reduce U.S. health care spending, while improving the 
patient experience of care in terms of quality and satisfaction, and driving 
better patient health outcomes? Mergers, partnerships, and consolidation in the 
health care industry, new care delivery models like Accountable Care 
Organizations and integrated care systems, bundled payments, information 
technology, innovation through new drugs and new medical devices, or some 
combination of the foregoing? More importantly, recent ambitious reform efforts 
fall short of a cohesive approach, leaving fundamental internal inconsistencies 
across divergent arms of the federal government, raising the issue of whether 
the U.S. health care system can drive sufficient efficiencies within the current 
health care and antitrust regulatory environments. While debate rages on Capitol 
Hill over "repeal and replace," only limited attention has been directed toward 
reforming the current "fee-for-service" model pursuant to which providers are 
paid for volume of care rather than quality or outcomes. Indeed, both the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("ACA") 3 and proposals for its 
replacement focus primarily on the reach and cost of providing coverage for 
health care, rather than specifics for the delivery of health care. 4 With the 
U.S. expenditures on health care producing inferior results, experts see 
consolidation and alternatives to fee-for-service as fundamental to reducing 
costs. 5 Integrating care coordination and delivery and increasing scale to 
drive efficiencies allows organizations to benefit from shared savings and 
relationships with payors and vendors. 6 Deloitte forecasts that, by 2024, the 
current health system landscape-which includes roughly 80 national health 
systems, 275 regional systems, 130 academic medical centers, and 1,300 small 
community systems-will morph into just over 900 multi-hospital systems. 7 Even 
though health care market and payment reforms encourage organizations to 
consolidate and integrate, innovators must proceed with extreme caution. Health 
care organizations attempting to drive efficiencies and bring down costs through 
mergers may run afoul of numerous federal and state laws and regulations. 8 
Calls for updates or leniency in these laws are growing, including the possible 
recognition of an "Obamacare defense" to antitrust restrictions 9 and 
speculation that laws restricting physicians from having financial relationships 
will be repealed, ostensibly to allow sharing of the rewards reaped from 
coordinated care. 10 In the meantime, however, absent specific waivers or 
exemptions, all the usual rules and regulations apply, including antitrust 
constraints, 11 physician self-referral 12 and anti-kickback laws and 
regulations, 13 state fraud and abuse restrictions, 14 and more. In short, a 
maelstrom of conflicting political prescriptions, health care regulations, and 
antitrust restrictions undermine the ability of innovators to achieve 
efficiencies through joint ventures, transactions, innovative models, and other 
structures. This article first considers the conflicting positions taken by the 
United States government with respect to achieving efficiencies in health care 
under the ACA and alternative delivery models, on the one hand, and health care 
regulatory enforcement and antitrust enforcement, on the other. At almost a 
fifth of the U.S. economy, 15 health care arguably has grown ungovernable, 
exceeding the ability of any one law or branch of government to create or 
implement coherent reform. Indeed, the article posits that although the ACA 
reformed and expanded access to health care, it failed to transform the way 
health care is delivered beyond limited "demonstration projects", leaving 
fee-for-service intact. Nonetheless, even with limited rather than revolutionary 
goals, the ACA still lacks sufficient authority across disparate branches of 
government to achieve its stated goals. The article then examines the 
conflicting positions of the various United States regulatory schemes and 
enforcement agencies governing health care, and whether they can be reconciled 
with the stated goal of the government, often referred to as the "Triple Aim": 
16 improving quality of care, improving population health, and lowering health 
care costs. It examines fundamental, systemic challenges to achieving the 
"Triple Aim": longstanding health care regulatory laws that impede adoption of 
innovative delivery systems beyond their current "demonstration project" status, 
and antitrust enforcement that promotes waste and duplication in densely 
populated areas, while preventing necessary consolidation to more efficiently 
reach rural areas. The article concludes with recommendations for promoting 
efficiency through modest reconciliation of the conflicting goals and 
regulations in health care.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between reproductive history, pregnancy 
complications, and later physical function.
STUDY DESIGN: The Bogalusa Heart Study is a long-running study of cardiovascular 
health in a semirural community. 761 women were interviewed about their 
pregnancy history and complications, and underwent tests of physical function. 
Logistic models for dichotomous outcomes and linear models for continuous 
outcomes were used, adjusted for covariates.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall scores on the Short Physical Performance Battery 
(SPPB), which combines scores for balance, gait speed, and chair stands. 
Additional tests were a 6-min walk, knee extension strength, grip strength, and 
a pegboard challenge.
RESULTS: Nulliparity was associated with lower scores on the walking and balance 
portions of the SPPB, less distance covered in the 6-min walk, less knee and 
grip strength, and higher pegboard time, especially among pre-menopausal women. 
A history of gestational diabetes was associated with more problems on the walk 
portion of the SPPB (aOR 2.44, 1.06-5.65), higher chair stand time, and lower 
knee strength. Young age at first birth (<16 or 18 years) was associated with a 
shorter chair stand time and a better pegboard score.
CONCLUSIONS: Nulliparity was associated with worse physical functioning, while 
high parity and early pregnancy were not, suggesting that fertility is 
associated with better health later in life. Pregnancy complications were 
associated with worse physical functioning, even after controlling for body mass 
index. Future studies should attempt to establish the pathways by which 
reproductive health relates to overall physical functioning.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Short-course radiotherapy (25 Gy in five fractions) was 
recently shown in a randomized phase III trial to be non-inferior to 40 Gy in 15 
fractions in elderly and/or frail patients with glioblastoma multiforme. This 
study compared the cost-effectiveness of the two regimens.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The direct unit costs of imaging, radiotherapy (RT), and 
dexamethasone were collected from the five primary contributing countries to the 
trial, constituting the data of 88% of all patients. Effectiveness was measured 
by the restricted mean overall survival (RMOS) and progression free survival 
(RMPFS). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. 
Indirect costs were also estimated for comparison.
RESULTS: The median OSs for the short-course and commonly used RTs were 8.2 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 6.1-10.3) and 7.7 (95% CI 5.5-9.9) months, respectively 
(log rank p = 0.340). Median PFSs were also not different (p = 0.686). The 
differences in the RMOS and the ICER, however, were +0.11 life-years and -$3062 
United States dollars (USD) per life-year gained, respectively. The differences 
in the RMPFS and the ICER were +0.02 PFS and -$17,693 USD, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The ICER of -$3062 per life-year gained and -$17,693 per PFS gained 
indicates that the short-course RT is less costly compared to the longer RT 
regimen.

Dormancy is an innate constraint on germination that occurs across all life 
forms. In this study, we investigated the seed dormancy release and germination 
characters of Taxus yunnanensis by exploring the seed morphology, permeability, 
germination inhibitors, endogenous hormones, and embryo germination in vitro 
during wet sand storage. Our results showed that seeds and embryos grew to a 
critical size to germination and permeability increased with the extension of 
storage. Seed coat and kernel methanol extracts reduced Brassica campestris seed 
vigor index. The in vitro embryo germination rate increased by 12.20% after 
storage for 30-360 d, whereas seed germination occurred after 450 d. Gibberellic 
acid and zeatin riboside contents were relatively stable, whereas abscisic acid 
(ABA) content decreased; indole acetic acid (IAA) content and the IAA/ABA ratio 
showed increasing trends. These results indicate that ABA is the key inhibitor 
of germination in Taxus. The chemical(s) in seed coat and kernel cause the 
inhibition of seed germination. Taken together, Taxus seeds have 
morphophysiological dormancy, in which the embryos can continue to grow and 
hormone imbalance inhibits further development and germination. Further, seed 
dormancy is active even during the middle of storage and shows "double peaks" 
during the entire dormancy process.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset motor neuron disease with 
mostly dominant inheritance and a life expectancy of 2-5 years; however, a quite 
common occurrence of atypical forms of the disease, due to recessive 
inheritance, has become evident with the use of NGS technologies. In this paper, 
we describe a family with close consanguinity for at least four generations, 
suffering from a slowly progressive form of ALS. Spastic walking is observed 
since teenage years, while bulbar symptoms start much later, at the fifth or 
sixth decade of life. Patients usually die because of respiratory failure. Using 
whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous p.(Val94Ala) (c.281T>C) 
(NG_052910.1) (NM_006459) variation in the endoplasmic reticulum lipid raft 
associated protein 1 (ERLIN1) gene, which segregates with the disease in the 
family. Here we suggest that ERLIN1 variants, previously shown in juvenile 
hereditary spastic paraplegia cases, may also be the cause of a slowly 
progressive early-onset ALS, starting with upper motor neuron features and 
developing into classical ALS with the addition of lower motor neuron 
dysfunction. We also demonstrate that ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 2 
(ABCC2) gene, responsible for hyperbilirubinemia, is linked to ERLIN1.

Genetic investigations of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) have identified a 
susceptibility locus at p23.3 of chromosome 11, which contains the CXCR5 gene. 
C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5) is a chemokine receptor expressed on B 
and T cell subsets, and binds the chemotactic ligand C-X-C motif chemokine 
ligand 13 (CXCL13). In this study we aimed to link the genetic association with 
functional effects and explore the CXCR5/CXCL13 axis in SS. Expression 
quantitative trait loci analysis of the 11q23.3 locus was performed using B cell 
mRNA expression data from genotyped individuals. Lymphocyte surface markers were 
assessed by flow cytometry, and CXCL13 levels by a proximity extension assay. 
CXCR5+ and CXCL13+ cells in minor salivary glands were detected using 
immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated that SS-associated genetic 
polymorphisms affected the expression of CXCR5 (P < 0·01). Notably, a decreased 
percentage of CXCR5+ cells, with lower CXCR5 expression, was observed for most 
circulating B and T cell subsets in SS patients, reaching statistical 
significance in CD19+ CD27+ immunoglobulin (Ig)D+ marginal zone (P < 0·001), 
CD19+ CD27+ IgD- memory (P < 0·05) and CD27-IgD double-negative (P < 0·01) B 
cells and CD4+ CXCR3- CCR6+ Th17 cells (P < 0·05). CXCL13 levels were increased 
in patient plasma (P < 0·001), and immunohistochemical staining revealed 
expression of CXCL13 and higher numbers of CXCR5+ cells (P < 0·0001) within 
focal infiltrates and interstitially in salivary glands of SS patients. In 
conclusion, we link a genetic susceptibility allele for SS to a functional 
phenotype in terms of decreased CXCR5 expression. The decrease of CXCR5+ cells 
in circulation was also related to homing of B and T cells to the autoimmune 
target organ. Therapeutic drugs targeting the CXCR5/CXCL13 axis may be useful in 
SS.

BACKGROUND: Most health authorities do not recommend screening for prostate 
cancer with PSA tests in asymptomatic patients who are not at increased risk. 
However, opportunistic screening for prostate cancer is still wanted by many 
patients and it is widely used in primary care clinics, with potential for 
overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Better tools for risk assessment have been 
called for, to better target such opportunistic screening. Our aim was to 
explore perceptions about prostate cancer risk and subsequent opportunistic 
screening among patients who were not at increased risk of prostate cancer after 
a first PSA test plus a genetic lifetime risk assessment.
METHODS: We undertook semi-structured patient interviews with recording and 
verbatim transcription of interviews. Data were analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Three themes were identified: uncertainty of the nature of prostate 
cancer; perceived benefits of testing; and conflicting public health 
recommendations. Prostate cancer was spoken of as an inescapable risk in older 
age. The aphorism "you die with it, not from it" was prominent in the interviews 
but patients focused on the benefits of testing now rather than the future risks 
associated with treatment relating to potential overdiagnosis. Many expressed 
frustration with perceived mixed messages about early detection of cancer, in 
which on one side men feel that they are encouraged to seek medical testing to 
act responsibly regarding the most common cancer disease in men, and on the 
other side they are asked to refrain from opportunistic testing for prostate 
cancer. Taken together, personal risks of prostate cancer were perceived as high 
in spite of a normal PSA test and a genetic lifetime risk assessment showing no 
increased risk.
CONCLUSION: Patients saw prostate cancer risk as high and increasing with age. 
They focused on the perceived benefit of early detection using PSA testing. It 
was also commonly acknowledged that most cases are indolent causing no symptoms 
and not shortening life expectancy. There was a frustration with mixed messages 
about the benefit of early detection and risk of overdiagnosis. These men's 
genetic lifetime risk assessment showing no increased risk did not appear to 
influence current intentions to get PSA testing in the future.
