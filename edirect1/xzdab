PURPOSE: Oligorecurrent prostate cancer has historically been treated with 
indefinite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), although many patients and 
providers opt to defer this treatment at the time of recurrence given 
quality-of-life and/or comorbidity considerations. Recently, metastasis-directed 
therapy (MDT) has emerged as a potential intermediary between surveillance and 
immediate continuous ADT. Simultaneously, advanced systemic therapy in addition 
to ADT has also been shown to improve survival in metastatic hormone-sensitive 
disease. This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of treating 
oligorecurrent patients with upfront MDT before standard-of-care systemic 
therapy.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov-based cost-effectiveness analysis was 
constructed comparing 3 strategies: (1) upfront MDT → salvage abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone (AAP) + ADT → salvage docetaxel + ADT; (2) upfront AAP + 
ADT → salvage docetaxel + ADT; and (3) upfront docetaxel + ADT → salvage AAP + 
ADT. Transition probabilities and utilities were derived from the literature. 
Using a 10-year time horizon and willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), net monetary benefit values were 
subsequently calculated for each treatment strategy.
RESULTS: At 10 years, the base case revealed a total cost of $141,148, $166,807, 
and $136,154 with QALYs of 4.63, 4.89, and 4.00, respectively, reflecting a net 
monetary benefit of $322,240, $322,018, and $263,407 for upfront MDT, upfront 
AAP + ADT, and upfront docetaxel + ADT, respectively. In the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation (1,000,000 simulations), 
upfront MDT was the cost-effective strategy in 53.6% of simulations. The 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed 95% confidence intervals for cost 
($75,914-$179,862, $124,431-$223,892, and $103,298-$180,617) and utility in 
QALYs (3.85-6.12, 3.91-5.86, and 3.02-5.22) for upfront MDT, upfront AAP + ADT, 
and upfront docetaxel + ADT, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: At 10 years, upfront MDT followed by salvage AAP + ADT, is 
comparably cost-effective compared with upfront standard-of-care systemic 
therapy and may be considered a viable treatment strategy, especially in 
patients wishing to defer systemic therapy for quality-of-life or comorbidity 
concerns. Additional studies are needed to determine whether MDT causes a 
sustained meaningful delay in disease natural history and whether any benefit 
exists in combining MDT with upfront advanced systemic therapy.

Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) is considered to be a 
benign precursor condition that may progress to a lymphoproliferative disease or 
multiple myeloma. Most patients do not progress to an overt condition, but 
nevertheless, MGUS is associated with a shortened life expectancy and, in a 
minority of cases, a number of co-morbid conditions that include an increased 
fracture risk, renal impairment, peripheral neuropathy, secondary 
immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular disease. This review aims to consolidate 
current evidence for the significance of these co-morbidities before considering 
how best to approach these symptoms and signs, which are often encountered in 
primary care or within a number of specialties in secondary care.

The WHO declared the novel coronavirus disease a pandemic, with severe 
consequences for health and global economic activity and Italy is one of the 
hardest hit countries. This study aims to assess the socio-economic burden of 
COVID-19 pandemic in Italy through the estimation of Disability-Adjusted Life 
Years (DALYs) and productivity loss. The observational study was based on data 
from official governmental sources collected since the inception of epidemic 
until 28 April 2020. DALYs for a disease combines the years of life lost due to 
premature mortality in the population and the years lost due to disability of 
the disease. In addition to DALYs, temporary productivity loss due to 
absenteeism from work and permanent productivity loss due to premature mortality 
were estimated using the Human Capital Approach. The total DALYs amount to 2.01 
per 1000 persons. The total permanent productivity loss was around EUR 300 
million while the temporary productivity loss was around EUR 100 million. This 
evaluation does not consider other economic aspects related to lockdown, 
quarantine of contacts, healthcare direct costs etc. The burden of disease 
methodology is functional metric for steering choices of health policy and 
allowing the government to be accountable for the utilization of resources.

BACKGROUND: The homeobox genes Pdx and Cdx are widespread across the animal 
kingdom and part of the small ParaHox gene cluster. Gene expression patterns 
suggest ancient roles for Pdx and Cdx in patterning the through-gut of 
bilaterian animals although functional data are available for few lineages. To 
examine evolutionary conservation of Pdx and Cdx gene functions, we focus on 
amphioxus, small marine animals that occupy a pivotal position in chordate 
evolution and in which ParaHox gene clustering was first reported.
RESULTS: Using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), we 
engineer frameshift mutations in the Pdx and Cdx genes of the amphioxus 
Branchiostoma floridae and establish mutant lines. Homozygous Pdx mutants have a 
defect in amphioxus endoderm, manifest as loss of a midgut region expressing 
endogenous GFP. The anus fails to open in homozygous Cdx mutants, which also 
have defects in posterior body extension and epidermal tail fin development. 
Treatment with an inverse agonist of retinoic acid (RA) signalling partially 
rescues the axial and tail fin phenotypes indicating they are caused by 
increased RA signalling. Gene expression analyses and luciferase assays suggest 
that posterior RA levels are kept low in wild type animals by a likely direct 
transcriptional regulation of a Cyp26 gene by Cdx. Transcriptome analysis 
reveals extensive gene expression changes in mutants, with a disproportionate 
effect of Pdx and Cdx on gut-enriched genes and a colinear-like effect of Cdx on 
Hox genes.
CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal that amphioxus Pdx and Cdx have roles in 
specifying middle and posterior cell fates in the endoderm of the gut, roles 
that likely date to the origin of Bilateria. This conclusion is consistent with 
these two ParaHox genes playing a role in the origin of the bilaterian 
through-gut with a distinct anus, morphological innovations that contributed to 
ecological change in the Cambrian. In addition, we find that amphioxus Cdx 
promotes body axis extension through a molecular mechanism conserved with 
vertebrates. The axial extension role for Cdx dates back at least to the origin 
of Chordata and may have facilitated the evolution of the post-anal tail and 
active locomotion in chordates.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic has affected every area of life. The greatest 
challenge has been to adapt the functioning of the health service to prevent the 
spread of the epidemic and to help infected patients. This has required the 
involvement of not only doctors and nurses, but also pharmacists. In the face of 
this pandemic, governments in many countries have granted pharmacists greater 
authority.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper is to review the legal extension of the 
role of pharmacists in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review considers 
recent changes in European countries, Canada, and the United States.
METHODS: A literature review was performed to summarise knowledge about the 
extension of the role of pharmacists during the pandemic period. Key articles 
were retrieved mainly from PubMed and Google Scholar, using the terms 
"COVID-19", "2019-nCoV", "coronavirus", and "pandemic" in combination with 
"pharmacist" as keywords for our search. We included scientific publications 
from February 1, 2019 to May 15, 2020.
RESULTS: Pharmacists have been given numerous opportunities so that they can 
actively join in the fight against the virus. Some of the novel legal extensions 
aimed at aiding overloaded healthcare systems are as follows: authorisation to 
prepare hand and surface disinfectants, eligibility to renew chronic treatment 
prescriptions, as well as filling pro auctore and pro familia prescriptions by 
pharmacists, performing COVID-19, influenza, and Group A Streptococcus screening 
tests, and vaccine administration. Moreover, many countries have facilitated 
Internet services, such as virtual medical consultations, e-prescriptions, and 
home drug delivery - to promote social distancing among patients. To mitigate 
drug shortages, the following strategies have been implemented: alternative 
sourcing, strength, generic, or therapeutic substitution, and preparing 
compounded formulations at the pharmacy.
CONCLUSIONS: Novel legal extensions have allowed exploitation of the full 
potential ofpharmacists worldwide, aiding the limited resources of overloaded 
healthcare systems.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of 100 days of antibiotics in patients 
with chronic low back pain (LBP) and type I or II Modic changes included in the 
Antibiotic treatment In patients with chronic low back pain and Modic changes 
(AIM) study.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis from a societal and healthcare perspective 
alongside a double-blinded, parallel group, placebo, multicentre trial.
SETTING: Hospital outpatient clinics at six hospitals in Norway. The main 
results from the AIM study showed a small effect in back-related disability in 
favour of the antibiotics group, and slightly larger in those with type I Modic 
changes, but this effect was below the pre-defined threshold for clinically 
relevant effect.
PARTICIPANTS: 180 patients with chronic LBP, previous disc herniation and Modic 
changes type I (n=118) or type II (n=62) were randomised to antibiotic treatment 
(n=89) or placebo-control (n=91).
INTERVENTIONS: Oral treatment with either 750 mg amoxicillin or placebo three 
times daily for 100 days.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by EuroQoL-5D over 12 
months and costs for healthcare and productivity loss measured in Euro (€1=NOK 
10), in the intention-to-treat population. Cost-utility was expressed in 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Mean (SD) total cost was €21 046 (20 105) in the amoxicillin group and 
€19 076 (19 356) in the placebo group, mean difference €1970 (95% CI; -3835 to 
7774). Cost per QALY gained was €24 625. In those with type I Modic changes, the 
amoxicillin group had higher healthcare consumption than the placebo group, 
resulting in €39 425 per QALY gained. Given these ICERs and a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €27 500 (NOK 275 000), the probability of amoxicillin being 
cost-effective was 51%. Even when the willingness-to-pay threshold increased to 
€55 000, the probability of amoxicillin being cost-effective was never higher 
than 53%.
CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin treatment showed no evidence of being cost-effective 
for people with chronic LBP and Modic changes during 1-year follow-up.

The role of two-pore channel type 2 (TPC2, encoded by tcpn2)-mediated Ca2+ 
release was recently characterized in zebrafish during establishment of the 
early spinal circuitry, one of the key events in the coordination of 
neuromuscular activity. Here, we extend our study to investigate the in vivo 
role of TPC2 in the regulation of caudal primary motor neuron (CaP) axon 
extension. We used a combination of TPC2 knockdown with a translation-blocking 
morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO), TPC2 knockout via the generation of a 
tpcn2dhkz1a mutant line of zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing and 
pharmacological inhibition of TPC2 via incubation with bafilomycin A1 (an 
H+-ATPase inhibitor) or trans-ned-19 (an NAADP receptor antagonist), and showed 
that these treatments attenuated CaP Ca2+ signaling and inhibited axon 
extension. We also characterized the expression of an arc1-like transcript in 
CaPs grown in primary culture. MO-mediated knockdown of ARC1-like in vivo led to 
attenuation of the Ca2+ transients in the CaP growth cones and an inhibition of 
axon extension. Together, our new data suggest a link between ARC1-like, TPC2 
and Ca2+ signaling during axon extension in zebrafish.

INTRODUCTION: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes. 
DKA is associated with poorer cognition in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 
but whether this is the case in older adults with T1D is unknown. Given the 
increasing life expectancy in T1D, understanding the role of DKA on brain health 
in older adults is crucial.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the association of DKA with cognitive 
function in 714 older adults with T1D from the Study of Longevity in Diabetes. 
Participants self-reported lifetime exposure to DKA resulting in 
hospitalization; DKA was categorized into 0 hospitalization, 1 hospitalization 
or ≥2 hospitalizations (recurrent DKA). Global and domain-specific cognition 
(language, executive function/psychomotor speed, episodic memory and simple 
attention) were assessed. The association of DKA with cognitive function was 
evaluated via linear and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of participants (mean age=67 years; mean age at 
diagnosis=28 years; average duration of diabetes=39 years) reported a lifetime 
history of DKA resulting in hospitalization (18.5% single DKA; 9.7% recurrent 
DKA). In fully adjusted models, those with recurrent DKA had lower global 
cognitive function (β=-0.13; 95% CI -0.22 to 0.02) and lower scores on the 
executive function/psychomotor speed domain (β=-0.34; 95% CI -0.51 to 0.17). 
Individuals with recurrent DKA were also more likely to have the lowest level of 
cognitive function on the executive function/psychomotor speed domain (defined 
as 1.5 SD below the population mean; OR=3.26, 95% CI 1.43 to 7.42).
CONCLUSIONS: Among 714 older adults with T1D, recurrent DKA was associated with 
lower global cognitive function, lower scores on the executive 
function/psychomotor speed domain and 3.3 times greater risk of having the 
lowest level of cognitive function in our sample on the executive 
function/psychomotor speed domain. These findings suggest that recurrent DKA may 
negatively impact the brain health of older patients with T1D and highlight the 
importance of DKA prevention.

Cardiorespiratory fitness is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease and shortened life expectancy in breast cancer survivors. This 
randomised controlled trial (n = 153) was designed for patients with a 
physically inactive lifestyle prediagnosis and concurrently referred to adjuvant 
chemotherapy. We compared two 12-week exercise interventions aimed at 
physiological and patient-reported outcomes (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle 
strength, metabolic markers, physical activity, pain, fatigue), including a 
39-week follow-up. A supervised hospital-based moderate to high intensity group 
exercise intervention was compared to an instructed home-based individual 
pedometer intervention. The two 12-week interventions included oncologists' 
recommendations and systematic health counselling. Outcomes were measured at 
baseline and week 6, 12 and 39. Primary outcome cardiorespiratory fitness 
declined significantly during chemotherapy and was restored in both 
interventions at follow-up. The interventions effectively engaged breast cancer 
patients in sustaining physical activities during and following adjuvant 
treatment. A composite metabolic score improved significantly. Positive 
cardiorespiratory fitness responders had improved clinical effects on fatigue, 
pain and dyspnoea versus negative responders. We conclude that a loss of 
cardiorespiratory fitness among physically inactive breast cancer patients may 
be restored by early initiated interventions and by adapting to physical 
activity recommendations, leading to a decreased cardiovascular risk profile in 
breast cancer survivors.

PURPOSE: Metastatic spinal cord compression (SCC) secondary to small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) is a disastrous oncological emergency, but it is poorly understood 
due to the small numbers of patients and their short survival times. Whether 
patients suffered from SCC caused by metastatic SCLC benefit from spinal surgery 
remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of surgical 
treatment and prognostic factors in patients with SCC caused by metastatic SCLC.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2019, 30 consecutive patients surgically treated for 
metastatic SCC from SCLC were enrolled in this retrospective analysis. 
Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to estimate overall 
survival (OS) and identify prognostic factors. Quality of life (QoL) was 
assessed by the three-level EuroQol-five-Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L) instrument and 
compared using Student's t test.
RESULTS: The median OS time was 9 months in our series. Relief of pain, 
preservation of neurological function, and improvement of performance status 
were achieved after surgical intervention. The mean EQ-5D-3L utility score 
showed a significant improvement after surgery (0.3394 preoperatively vs 0.5884 
postoperatively). According to Cox regression analysis, postoperative ECOG-PS 
and immunotherapy were identified to be independent prognostic factors for 
patients with SCC caused by metastatic SCLC.
CONCLUSION: Despite the short life expectancy, prompt surgical decompression is 
extremely necessary for patients with SCC caused by SCLC, for surgery played a 
critical role in improving patients' QoL. Better performance status after 
surgery and receiving immunotherapy were associated with a longer OS.

Longitudinal studies examining changes in physical functioning with advancing 
age among very old people are plagued by high death rates, which can lead to 
biased estimates. This study was conducted to analyse changes in physical 
functioning among the oldest old with three distinct methods which differ in how 
they handle dropout due to death. The sample consisted of 3992 persons aged 90 
or over in the Vitality 90+ Study who were followed up on average for 2.5 years 
(range 0-13 years). A generalized estimating equation (GEE) with independent 
'working' correlation, a linear mixed-effects (LME) model and a joint model 
consisting of longitudinal and survival submodels were used to estimate the 
effect of age on physical functioning over 13 years of follow-up. We observed 
significant age-related decline in physical functioning, which furthermore 
accelerated significantly with age. The average rate of decline differed 
markedly between the models: the GEE-based estimate for linear decline among 
survivors was about one-third of the average individual decline in the joint 
model and half the decline indicated by the LME model. In conclusion, the three 
methods yield substantially different views on decline in physical functioning: 
the GEE model may be useful for considering the effect of intervention measures 
on the outcome among living people, whereas the LME model is biased regarding 
studying outcomes associated with death. The joint model may be valuable for 
predicting the future characteristics of the oldest old and planning elderly 
care as life expectancy continues gradually to rise.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disease. Life expectancy of 
patients with CF continues to improve mainly driven by the evolving therapies 
for CF-related organ dysfunction. The prevalence of CF-related diabetes (CFRD) 
increases exponentially as patients' age. Clinical care guidelines for CFRD from 
2010, recommend insulin as the mainstay of treatment. Many patients with CFRD 
may not require exogenous insulin due to the heterogeneity of this clinical 
entity. Maintenance of euglycemia by enhancing endogenous insulin production, 
secretion and degradation with novel pharmacological therapies like 
glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist is an option that remains to be fully explored. 
As such, the scope of this article will focus on our perspective of 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in the context of CFRD. Other potential 
options such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 
inhibitors and their impact on this patient population is limited and further 
studies are required.

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a relatively common congenital cardiac defect 
often causing few symptoms and therefore can be challenging to diagnose. The 
hallmark finding on physical examination is upper extremity hypertension, and 
for this reason, CoA should be considered in any young hypertensive patient, 
justifying measurement of lower extremity blood pressure at least once in these 
individuals. The presence of a significant pressure gradient between the arms 
and legs is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment 
are important as long-term data consistently demonstrate that patients with CoA 
have a reduced life expectancy and increased risk of cardiovascular 
complications. Surgical repair has traditionally been the mainstay of therapy 
for correction, although advances in endovascular technology with covered stents 
or stent grafts permit nonsurgical approaches for the management of older 
children and adults with native CoA and complications. Persistent hypertension 
and vascular dysfunction can lead to an increased risk of coronary disease, 
which, remains the greatest cause of long-term mortality. Thus, blood pressure 
control and periodic reassessment with transthoracic echocardiography and 
three-dimensional imaging (computed tomography or cardiac magnetic resonance) 
for should be performed regularly as cardiovascular complications may occur 
decades after the intervention.

Burden of road traffic accidents in the Greater Maghreb (1990-2017).

Hannachi H, Khiari H, Hsairi M.

OBJECTIVE: To study the burden of Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) in the Maghreb 
and its evolution during the period 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: We described the RTA in the Maghreb region, while analyzing database 
provided by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) for the 
period1990-2017.
RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rate of RTA has decreased overall across 
the Maghreb; it went from 719.57/100000 inhabitants in 1990 to 609.49 per 
100,000 inhabitants in 2017. In 2017, the highest mortality rate in the region 
was noted in Tunisia and it was 30.15 / 100,000 inhabitants (CI95% = 
24.05-37.08). The highest and lowest standardized rates for disability adjusted 
life years or DALYs were observed respectively in Tunisia: 1,311.56 per 100,000 
inhabitants (CI95%=1,065.28-1588.68) and in Algeria: 962.68 per 100,000 
inhabitants (CI95%=789.50- 1460.12).
CONCLUSION: The burden of disease from road accidents is high in the Maghreb 
countries and the downward trend in the incidence of these accidents is 
relatively low. These results should encourage decision-makers to elaborate an 
integrated and multisectorial strategy to improve the situation.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to: identify the evidence on 
cost-effectiveness of school-based interventions for caries prevention globally 
up to 2019; summarize key characteristics of interventions applied within this 
setting; summarize the reporting quality of previous studies; and to identify 
and analyse knowledge gaps.
METHODS: A scoping review of published literature on the cost-effectiveness of 
school-based interventions to prevent child tooth decay was conducted. A search 
in Medline, Cinahl and Embase was performed with no date restriction. Reporting 
quality of the included studies was assessed against Consolidated Health 
Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist.
RESULTS: Of the 738 records identified in the initial search, 15 studies met the 
pre-specified inclusion criteria. The majority were published after 2011 
(n = 9,) and applied to high-income countries (n = 12). Nearly 80% of the 
studies assessed the cost-effectiveness of the interventions based on topical 
fluoride therapies and fissure sealants at school premises. Although, the 
outcome measures differed across the studies, almost all the caries preventive 
interventions were cost-saving or cost-effective when compared with usual care. 
Compliance with the CHEERS checklist differed.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that school-based caries preventive 
interventions are cost-effective, and in some cases cost-saving. Further 
evidence is required from low- to middle-income countries to confirm the 
generalizability of these findings. Future studies should consider adopting 
Quality Adjusted Life Years as a generic outcome measure that would enable the 
cost-effectiveness findings to be compared across different types of 
interventions and diseases. Improved standardization and quality of reporting 
are also required.

BACKGROUND: Mental health conditions remain a significant cause of disability in 
the Arab World. Palestinians are predominantly at a higher risk for mental 
health problems due to their chronic exposure to political violence, prolonged 
displacement, and others as limited professional, educational, financial 
opportunities and mental health services. Schizophrenia is an overwhelming 
mental illness that affects nearly one percent of the various populations 
throughout the world. Studies have shown patients with schizophrenia die 
prematurely and have lower life expectancy compared to the general population. 
Moreover, antipsychotic medications and client's lifestyle play a significant 
role in increased morbidity and mortality in these patients. The present study 
willingly undertakes a literature review on schizophrenia in the context of 
mental health services in Palestine.
METHODS: Studies were identified through PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, 
CINAHL, Semantic Scholar and Elsevier.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included in this review; 11 articles related 
to schizophrenia and thirteen articles related to mental health services in 
Westbank and Gaza. Results revealed the life of patients with schizophrenia in 
Palestine is complicated. Barriers as lacking awareness about mental illness, 
stigma, inconsistent availability of medications, absence of multidisciplinary 
teamwork, insufficient specialists, fragmented mental health system, occupation, 
and other obstacles stand in the face of improving the quality of life among 
these patients.
LIMITATIONS: Palestine is a state that is seeking independence with a scarcity 
of resources. It has been described as "uncharted territories'' due to a lack of 
data, resources and records. As a result, there is insufficient data regarding 
schizophrenia in Palestine. Therefore, a thesis study that estimated 10 years' 
risk of coronary heart diseases in patients with schizophrenia was included.
CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations include ending the occupation as the leading cause 
of mental illness for Palestinians and implementing efficient and effective 
mental health nursing care through the multidisciplinary work and raising 
awareness regarding mental illness to fight the stigma.

Community-based social determinants of three measures of mortality in Rhode 
Island cities and towns.

Independence Way Suite P, Kingston, Rhode Island 02881 USA.

BACKGROUND: Efforts to understand and address the causes of place-based health 
disparities have focused primarily on understanding the social determinants of 
health on a large geographic level, such as the region, state, or county. 
However, there is a growing need to assess and understand how place-based 
characteristics at smaller geographic areas relate to of local place-based 
neighborhood characteristics on population health. Therefore, the objective of 
this study was to evaluate the magnitude of the associations between social 
determinants of health and life expectancy (LE) and related measures on the 
community level.
METHODS: LE at birth (LE0), remaining LE at age 65 (LE65), and age-specific 
mortality rates (ASMR) were calculated from mortality data (2009-2011) collected 
by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDoH) using abridged life table 
methods for each RI city/town. The city/town-specific LE and ASMR were linked to 
data collected by the US Census, RIDoH, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and 
other databases that include information about multiple social, environmental, 
and demographic determinants of health. Bivariate correlations between 
city/town-level LE0, LE65, and ASMR and social determinants: demographics, 
household composition, income and poverty, education, environment, food 
insecurity, crime, transportation, and rural-urban status were examined.
RESULTS: LE0 (range: 75.9-83.3 years) was strongly associated with the percent 
of the population with a graduate/professional degree (r = 0.687, p <  0.001), 
violent crime rate (r = - 0.598, p <  0.001), and per capita income (r = 0.553, 
p <  0.001). Similar results were observed for ASMR: ASMR was associated with 
the percent of the population with a graduate/professional degree (r = - 0.596, 
p <  0.001), violent crime rate (r = 0.450, p = 0.005), and per capita income 
(r = - 0.533, p < 0.001). The associations between LE65 and social determinants 
were more attenuated. Of note, none of the measures (LE0, LE65, or ASMR) were 
associated with any of the race/ethnicity variables.
CONCLUSIONS: There are several important place-based characteristics associated 
with mortality (LE and ASMR) among RI cities/towns. Additionally, some 
communities had unexpectedly high LE and low ASMR, despite poor social 
indicators.

Eimeria spp. are important intestinal pathogens of chickens (Gallus gallus 
domesticus). Anticoccidial feed additives, chemicals, and ionophores have 
traditionally been used to control Eimeria infections in broiler production. 
Thus, the trend toward antibiotic-free and organic production requires new 
approaches to coccidiosis prevention. Two not mutually exclusive methods are the 
use of plant extracts with antiparasitic activity and manipulation of the 
intestinal microbiota by pre- and probiotics. In the present study, birds were 
inoculated with a combination of Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima, and Eimeria 
tenella. We profiled the jejunal microbiome at multiple time points 
postinfection to investigate the changes in jejunum microbiota and to identify 
the time point of the maximum difference between infected and noninfected birds. 
Additionally, we assessed the anticoccidial effects of two anecdotal treatment 
methods, green tea and apple cider vinegar, as well as amprolium. Green tea and 
apple cider vinegar had no effect on oocyst shedding, but green tea reduced the 
mild unspecific lesions in coccidia-infected birds; there was no influence on 
unspecific lesions in uninfected controls. Jejunal contents were collected on 
the day of the infection and 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 14 days postinfection (dpi) for 
investigation of the intestinal microbiota by 16S ribosomal (r)RNA gene 
sequencing. Comparison of the untreated-uninfected and the untreated-infected 
groups showed a maximum community dissimilarity of 10 dpi. From 4 days after 
infection, Clostridiales were significantly enriched at the expense of 
Lactobacillales in infected compared with uninfected birds. Interestingly, 
treatment with green tea prevented proliferation of Clostridiales induced by the 
coccidia and increased the relative abundance of Melainabacteria.

Publisher: Influencia de la infección de Eimeria spp. en el microbiota yeyunal 
del pollo y en la eficacia de dos productos alternativos contra la infección. 
Los protozoarios del género Eimeria spp. son importantes patógenos intestinales 
de los pollos (Gallus gallus domesticus). Los aditivos anticoccidiales en el 
alimento, los productos químicos y los ionóforos se han utilizado 
tradicionalmente para controlar las infecciones por Eimeria en la producción de 
pollos de engorde. Por lo tanto, la tendencia hacia la producción orgánica y 
libre de antibióticos requiere nuevos enfoques para la prevención de la 
coccidiosis. Dos métodos no mutuamente excluyentes son el uso de extractos de 
plantas con actividad antiparasitaria y la manipulación de la microbiota 
intestinal por prebióticos y probióticos. En el presente estudio, las aves 
fueron inoculadas con una combinación de Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima y 
Eimeria tenella. Se determinó el perfil del microbioma yeyunal en múltiples 
puntos de tiempo después de la infección, para investigar los cambios en la 
microbiota del yeyuno e identificar el momento donde se observa la diferencia 
máxima entre las aves infectadas y no infectadas. Además, se evaluaron los 
efectos anticoccidiales de dos métodos de tratamiento basados por datos 
anecdóticos, el té verde y el vinagre de sidra de manzana, así como el 
amprolium. El té verde y el vinagre de sidra de manzana no tuvieron ningún 
efecto sobre el desprendimiento de oocistos, pero el té verde redujo las 
lesiones leves inespecíficas en aves infectadas con coccidia; no hubo influencia 
en lesiones inespecíficas en controles no infectados. Los contenidos yeyunales 
se recogieron el día de la infección y a los días 1, 2, 4, 6, 10 y 14 después de 
la infección (dpi) para la investigación de la microbiota intestinal mediante 
secuenciación del gene del ARN ribosómico 16S. La comparación de los grupos no 
tratados-no infectados y no tratados-infectados mostró una diferencia máxima en 
la comunidad a los diez días después de la inoculación. A partir de los cuatro 
días después de la infección, los agentes Clostridiales se enriquecieron 
significativamente a expensas de los Lactobacillales en aves infectadas en 
comparación con las aves no infectadas. Curiosamente, el tratamiento con té 
verde evitó la proliferación de Clostridiales inducida por los coccidios y 
aumentó la abundancia relativa de melainabacterias.
