The Health Star Rating (HSR) system is a voluntary front-of-pack labelling 
(FoPL) initiative endorsed by the Australian government in 2014. This study 
examines the impact of the HSR system on pre-packaged food reformulation 
measured by changes in energy density between products with and without HSR. The 
cost-effectiveness of the HSR system was modelled using a proportional 
multi-state life table Markov model for the 2010 Australian population. We 
evaluated scenarios in which the HSR system was implemented on a voluntary and 
mandatory basis (i.e., HSR uptake across 6.7% and 100% of applicable products, 
respectively). The main outcomes were health-adjusted life years (HALYs), net 
costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). These were calculated 
with accompanying 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UI). The model predicted that 
HSR-attributable reformulation leads to small changes [corrected] in mean 
population energy intake (voluntary: -0.98 kJ/day; mandatory: -11.81 kJ/day). 
[corrected]. These are likely to result in changes in mean body weight 
(voluntary: -0.01 kg [95% UI: -0.012 to -0.006]; mandatory: -0.11 kg [95% UI: 
-0.14 to -0.07, and HALYs gained [corrected] (voluntary: 4207 HALYs gained 
[corrected] [95% UI: 2438 to 6081]; mandatory: 49,949 HALYs gained [95% UI: 
29,291 to 72,153]). The HSR system [corrected] could be considered 
cost-effective relative to a willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000 per HALY 
(incremental cost effectiveness ratio for voluntary: [corrected] A$1728 per HALY 
[95% UI: dominant to 10,445] and mandatory: A$4752 per HALY [95% UI: dominant to 
16,236]).

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) imposes a substantial cost burden on the 
healthcare system. Weight and risk factor management (RFM) reduces AF burden and 
improves the outcomes of AF ablation.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the cost and clinical effectiveness of 
integrating RFM into the overall management of AF.
METHODS: Of 1,415 consecutive patients with symptomatic AF, 825 patients had 
body mass index ≥27 kg/m2. After screening for exclusion criteria, the final 
cohort comprised 355 patients: 208 patients who opted for RFM and 147 control 
subjects and were followed by 3 to 6 monthly clinic review, 7-day Holter 
monitoring, and AF Symptom Score. A decision analytical model calculated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of cost per unit of global well-being 
gained and unit of AF burden reduced.
RESULTS: There were no differences in baseline characteristics or follow-up 
duration (p = NS). Arrhythmia-free survival was better in the RFM compared with 
control subjects (Kaplan-Meier: 79% vs. 44%; p < 0.001). At follow-up, RFM group 
had less unplanned specialist visits (0.19 ± 0.40 vs. 1.94 ± 2.00; p < 0.001), 
hospitalizations (0.74 ± 1.3 vs. 1.05 ± 1.60; p = 0.03), cardioversions (0.89 ± 
1.50 vs. 1.51 ± 2.30; p = 0.002), emergency presentations (0.18 ± 0.50 vs. 0.76 
± 1.20; p < 0.001), and ablation procedures (0.60 ± 0.69 vs. 0.72 ± 0.86; p = 
0.03). Antihypertensive (0.53 ± 0.70 vs. 0.78 ± 0.60; p = 0.04) and 
antiarrhythmic (0.26 ± 0.50 vs. 0.91 ± 0.60; p = 0.003) use declined in RFM. The 
RFM group had an increase of 0.1930 quality-adjusted life years and a cost 
saving of $12,094 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $62,653 saved per 
quality-adjusted life years gained).
CONCLUSIONS: A structured physician-directed RFM program is clinically effective 
and cost saving.

There is limited empirical evidence of the nature of any relationship between 
health spending and health outcomes in Australia. We address this by estimating 
the elasticity of health outcomes with respect to public healthcare spending 
using an instrumental variable (IV) approach to account for endogeneity of 
healthcare spending to health outcomes. Results suggest that, based on the 
conditional mean, a 1% increase in public health spending was associated with a 
2.2% (p < 0.05) reduction in the number of standardised Years of Life Lost 
(YLL). Sensitivity analyses and robustness checks supported this conclusion. 
Further exploration using IV quantile regression indicated that marginal returns 
on public health spending were significantly greater for areas with poorer 
health outcomes compared to areas with better health outcomes. On average, 
marginal increases in public health spending reduce YLL, but areas with poorer 
health outcomes have the greatest potential to benefit from the same marginal 
increase in public health spending compared to areas with better health 
outcomes. Understanding the relationship between health spending and outcomes 
and how this differs according to baseline health outcomes can help meet dual 
policy objectives to improve the productivity of the healthcare system and 
reduce inequity.

Approximately 75% of patients with late-stage breast cancer will develop bone 
metastasis. This condition is currently considered incurable and patients' life 
expectancy is limited to 2-3 years following diagnosis of bone involvement. 
Interleukin (IL)-1B is a pro-inflammatory cytokine whose expression in primary 
tumours has been identified as a potential biomarker for predicting breast 
cancer patients at increased risk for developing bone metastasis. In this 
review, we discuss how IL-1B from both the tumour cells and the tumour 
microenvironment influence growth of primary breast tumours, dissemination into 
the bone metastatic niche and proliferation into overt metastases. Recent 
evidence indicates that targeting IL-1B signalling may provide promising new 
treatments that can hold tumour cells in a dormant state within bone thus 
preventing formation of overt bone metastases.

The major symptoms of advanced hepatopancreatic-biliary cancer are biliary 
obstruction, pain and gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). For obstructive 
jaundice, surgical treatment should de consider in recurrent stent 
complications. The role of surgery for pain relief is marginal nowadays. On the 
last, there is no consensus for treatment of malignant GOO. Endoscopic duodenal 
stents are associated with shorter length of stay and faster relief to oral 
intake with more recurrent symptoms. Surgical gastrojejunostomy shows better 
long-term results and lower re-intervention rates, but there are limited data 
about laparoscopic approach. We performed a systematic review of the literature, 
according PRISMA guidelines, to search for articles on laparoscopic 
gastrojejunostomy for malignant GOO treatment. We also report our personal 
series, from 2009 to 2017. A review of the literature suggests that there is no 
standardized surgical technique either standardized outcomes to report. Most of 
the studies are case series, so level of evidence is low. Decision-making must 
consider medical condition, nutritional status, quality of life and life 
expectancy. Evaluation of the patient and multidisciplinary expertise are 
required to select appropriate approach. Given the limited studies and the 
difficulty to perform prospective controlled trials, no study can answer all the 
complexities of malignant GOO and more outcome data is needed.

BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic form of pediatric 
treatment-resistant epilepsy with few effective treatment options. Stiripentol 
is approved for use in Canada for treatment of Dravet syndrome, but the 
associated long-term costs and benefits have not been well-studied and its cost 
effectiveness is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
stiripentol as an adjunctive treatment to clobazam and valproate for treatment 
of Dravet syndrome from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare payer.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed to estimate the costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with adjunctive stiripentol 
treatment compared with clobazam and valproate alone in children with Dravet 
syndrome. Transition probabilities, drug efficacy, utility weights, and costs 
were obtained from a review of the literature. Probabilistic analyses were 
conducted using a Markov model with health states related to seizure frequency. 
A 10-year horizon was used. The incremental cost per QALY gained (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) for adjunctive use of stiripentol was 
calculated, and assumptions were explored in scenario analyses. All costs are 
expressed in 2017 Canadian dollars ($Can).
RESULTS: Compared with clobazam and valproate alone, the adjunctive use of 
stiripentol is associated with an ICER of $Can151,310. At a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $Can50,000, the probability that stiripentol was the optimal 
treatment was 5.2%. The cost of stiripentol would need to be reduced by 61.4% 
for stiripentol to be cost effective.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare payer, 
stiripentol is not cost effective at its current price at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $Can50,000. Funding stiripentol will be associated with important 
opportunity costs that bear consideration.

BACKGROUND: Collaborative care can support the treatment of depression in people 
with long-term conditions, but long-term benefits and costs are unknown.AimsTo 
explore the long-term (24-month) effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
collaborative care in people with mental-physical multimorbidity.
METHOD: A cluster randomised trial compared collaborative care (integrated 
physical and mental healthcare) with usual care for depression alongside 
diabetes and/or coronary heart disease. Depression symptoms were measured by the 
symptom checklist-depression scale (SCL-D13). The economic evaluation was from 
the perspective of the English National Health Service.
RESULTS: 191 participants were allocated to collaborative care and 196 to usual 
care. At 24 months, the mean SCL-D13 score was 0.27 (95% CI, -0.48 to -0.06) 
lower in the collaborative care group alongside a gain of 0.14 (95% CI, 
0.06-0.21) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost per QALY gained was £13 
069.
CONCLUSIONS: In the long term, collaborative care reduces depression and is 
potentially cost-effective at internationally accepted willingness-to-pay 
thresholds.Declaration of interestNone.

OBJECTIVE: Designing optimal insurance is important to ensure access to care for 
individuals that are most likely to benefit. We examined the potential impact of 
lowering patient cost-sharing for bariatric procedures.
METHODS: After defining 10 subgroups by body mass index (BMI) and type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we analyzed the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey datasets to estimate the prevalence of each subgroup. The 
MarketScan claims database provided utilization rates and costs of bariatric 
procedures. Using an existing cost-effectiveness model, we estimated the 
economic value of bariatric procedures under various cost-sharing levels 
(0%-25%) with 2 frameworks: (1) a traditional cost-effectiveness analysis and 
(2) a new approach that incorporates utilization effects across subgroups.
RESULTS: The utilization rate was higher among individuals with T2DM than those 
without T2DM (90.4 vs. 59.1 cases per 100,000) for bariatric procedures, which 
were more cost-effective for those with T2DM and a higher BMI. After accounting 
for utilization effects, the economic value of bariatric surgery was $177 and 
$63 per individual from a lifetime and a 5-year time horizon, respectively. 
Under no patient cost-sharing for individuals with BMI≥40 and T2DM, utilization 
rates were expected to increase by 21 cases per 100,000, resulting in additional 
$2 realized value per patient and $7.07 million in returns at the US population 
level.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-sharing is a barrier to uptake of a clinical and 
cost-effective treatment for severe obesity. Reducing cost-sharing for patients 
with severe obesity and T2DM could potentially increase the utilization of 
bariatric procedures and result in greater economic value to payers.

Short-Term Effect of Low-Dose, Electromyography-Guided Botulinum Toxin A 
Injection in the Treatment of Chronic Lateral Epicondylar Tendinopathy: A 
Randomized, Double-Blinded Study.

Unit, CHU de Bordeaux, Université de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.

BACKGROUND: Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) is a novel treatment for chronic lateral 
epicondylar tendinopathy. Preliminary studies have demonstrated promising 
results; however, confirmation of the effectiveness of BoNT-A treatment and 
further assessment of its side effects are required. This study investigated the 
analgesic effects of BoNT-A in the treatment of chronic lateral epicondylar 
tendinopathy.
METHODS: This was a phase-III, single-center, randomized, double-blinded, 
placebo-controlled study including 60 patients with chronic lateral epicondylar 
tendinopathy that had been resistant to treatment for >6 months. Patients 
received either a 40-IU injection of BoNT-A or saline solution placebo into the 
extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle, aided by electromyographic (EMG) 
stimulation. Follow-up was 3 months. The primary assessment criterion was the 
percentage of patients whose pain was reduced by >50% at 90 days after 
injection. Secondary outcomes, including pain intensity, pain frequency, 
interference with quality of life, sick leave taken, maximum grip strength, and 
side effects, were assessed at days 30 and 90, and the number of participants 
per group requesting additional therapies at day 90 was recorded.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients in the BoNT-A group and 28 patients in the placebo 
group were included in the day-90 analysis. Fifteen (51.7%) of the patients who 
were administered BoNT-A and 7 (25%) of the patients who received placebo 
reported a >50% reduction in initial pain intensity at day 90 (p = 0.005). Pain 
intensity and the effect on quality of life, measured using visual analog 
scales, were both significantly lower in the group treated with BoNT-A compared 
with placebo at day 90 (p < 0.05). The rate of clinically detected transitory 
paresis of the third finger on extension was 17.2% in the BoNT-A group, with no 
associated functional impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: BoNT-A at 40 IU injected into the ECRB is an effective treatment 
for chronic lateral epicondylar tendinopathy that has been otherwise resistant 
to medical treatment. The rate of paresis of the third finger was low, with no 
associated functional impairment.

Major advances have been achieved in the field of self-healing by magnetic 
induction in which the addition of metallic particles into asphalt mixtures 
enables repairing their own cracks. This technology has already been proven to 
increase the life expectancy of roads. Nevertheless, its higher costs in 
comparison with conventional maintenance caused by the price of virgin metallic 
particles still makes it unattractive for investment. This research aimed at 
making this process economically accessible as well as environmentally 
efficient. To this end, an intense search for suitable industrial by-products to 
substitute both the virgin metal particles and the natural aggregates forming 
asphalt mixtures was conducted. The set of by-products used included sand 
blasting wastes, stainless shot wastes, and polished wastes as metallic 
particles and other inert by-products as aggregates. The results demonstrated 
that the by-products were adequately heated, which leads to satisfactory healing 
ratios in comparison with the reference mixture.

Burden of acute kidney injury in HIV patients under deoxycholate amphotericin B 
therapy for cryptococcal meningitis and cost-minimization analysis of 
amphotericin B lipid complex.

Deoxycholate amphotericin B (d-AMB) has a higher rate of acute kidney injury 
(AKI) in comparison of lipid formulations. However, lipid amphotericin B has 
high costs in developing countries. The aim of this study is to assemble a model 
of cost-minimization of amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) in patients with 
cryptococcal meningitis. This is a retrospective study done in a cohort of 
patients with cryptococcal meningitis to study the economic impact of its use in 
developing countries. Cost analysis were based on direct cost of different 
antifungal therapies, chronic dialysis after discharge, and survival of patients 
based on a retrospective cohort of 102 patients infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus with confirmed diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. From 
102 patients treated with d-AMB, 60.78% developed any grade of AKI and 10.78% 
developed AKI demanding hemodialysis. The percentage of patients with meningeal 
cryptococcosis treated with d-AMB that requeired chronic HD was 2.39%. The same 
model was performed for patient that would be treated with ABLC, which resulted 
in 0.20% of patients demanding chronic HD due to its lower nephrotoxicity. When 
the model is applied in 100 patients, the total costs with d-AMB would be US$ 
184,543 and with ABLC would be US$ 1,640,109 in 5 years. Treatment with ABLC 
would be cost saving in comparison to d-AMB treatment, if early switch of 
treatment occurred in patients presenting AKI. The change should be as soon as 
possible to avoid further complication, like dialysis, which is associated with 
a lower life expectancy.

Tremor is an involuntary rhythmic and oscillatory movement of a body part with a 
relatively constant frequency and variable amplitude. Alternating contractions 
of antagonistic muscles cause it. Tremor is the most common of all movement 
disorders, and essential tremor is the most common neurologic cause of postural 
or action tremor. It usually presents as a bilateral postural 6 to 12 Hz tremor 
of the hands, followed by a kinetic and resting component. The upper limbs are 
often symmetrically involved, but with disease progression, the head and voice 
(less commonly legs, jaw, face, and trunk) may be involved. Although benign 
regarding its effect on life expectancy, it often causes embarrassment and, in a 
small percentage of patients, also serious disability. Symptoms are typically 
progressive and potentially disabling, often forcing patients to change jobs or 
seek early retirement.

Adults with Developmental Disabilities: A Comprehensive Approach to Medical 
Care.

Kripke C(1).

Author information:
(1)University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Developmental disabilities are attributable to a cognitive impairment, physical 
impairment, or both. They manifest during the developmental period from birth to 
early adulthood, and are likely to continue indefinitely. The life expectancy of 
most persons with developmental disabilities now approaches that of the general 
population. According to the neurodiversity model of care, developmental 
disability is accepted as a valued part of human neurologic diversity. The 
social model focuses on improving participation in society with accommodations 
such as adaptive equipment or improvements to the social and physical 
environment. The goal of health care for patients with developmental 
disabilities is to improve their well-being, function, and participation in 
family and community. Physicians should communicate directly with their 
patients, even those who have communication or cognitive differences. 
Communication may include speech, sign language, writing, letter boards, voice 
output devices, pictures, facial expressions, gestures, vocalizations, and 
behavior. Supported decision making is a paradigm, support practice, and 
emerging legal structure that focuses on assisting patients with communicating 
their wants and needs as an alternative to guardianship or power of attorney. 
When establishing care, it is critical to get a detailed history of baseline 
traits and characteristics in the areas of cognition and communication; 
neuromuscular function; sensory function such as vision, hearing, and sensory 
processing; seizure threshold; mental health; and behavior. In general, 
guidelines for age-appropriate health maintenance in the general population 
should be followed unless the risk outweighs the benefit for an individual 
patient. With accurate diagnosis, psychiatric conditions can be treated 
effectively with the same medical, behavioral, and therapeutic modalities used 
in the general population. Just like any patient, those with developmental 
disabilities should have access to a full range of life-sustaining, curative, 
and end-of-life services.

AIM: To estimate the effect of proximal direct restorations in the adjacent 
periodontal tissues in adults from a birth cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A representative sample (n = 539) of all 5,914 births 
occurring in Pelotas, Brazil in 1982 was prospectively investigated, being 
clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing depth (PD), and bleeding on probing 
(BOP) assessed at 31-year old. For each site, tooth surface was evaluated as 
sound or restored, being the restoration extension (subgingival or 
supragingival) and restoration material (composite and amalgam) considered. 
Covariables included family income, untreated caries, and service utilization 
patterns during life course. Multilevel Poisson regression models were used, 
considering three levels of variables organization: periodontal site, dental, 
and individual level.
RESULTS: Among the 28,796 periodontal sites evaluated, CAL and PD ≥ 4 mm was 
observed in 1.5% and 4.8%, respectively. Multilevel models showed that proximal 
restorations had a significant effect on CAL and PD. Subgingival and amalgam 
restorations showed greater effect when compared to supragingival and composite 
restorations, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study partially supports the hypothesis that proximal 
restorations are associated with the presence of periodontal damage. Although 
not indicative of disease, a significant increase was observed in CAL and PD at 
restored sites.

INTRODUCTION: Prevention of overweight and obesity in childhood is a priority 
because of associated acute and chronic conditions in childhood and later in 
life, which place significant burden on health systems. Evidence suggests 
prevention should engage a range of actions and actors and target multiple 
levels. The Whole of Systems Trial Of Prevention Strategies for childhood 
obesity (WHO STOPS) will evaluate the outcomes of a novel systems-based 
intervention that aims to engage whole communities in a locally led multifaceted 
response. This paper describes the planned economic evaluation of WHO STOPS and 
examines the methodological challenges for economic evaluation of a complex 
systems-based intervention.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Economic evaluation alongside a stepped-wedge cluster 
randomised controlled trial in regional and rural communities in Victoria, 
Australia. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will provide estimates 
of the incremental cost (in $A) per body mass index unit saved and quality 
adjusted life year gained. A Markov cohort model will be employed to estimate 
healthcare cost savings and benefits over the life course of children. The 
dollar value of community resources harnessed for the community-led response 
will be estimated. Probabilistic uncertainty analyses will be undertaken to test 
sensitivity of results to plausible variations in all trial-based and modelled 
variables. WHO STOPS will also be assessed against other implementation 
considerations (such as sustainability and acceptability to communities and 
other stakeholders).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial is registered by the Australian New Zealand 
Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616000980437). Full ethics clearances have been 
received for all methods described below: Deakin University's Human Research

economic evaluation) will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented 
at international conferences. Collected data and analyses will be made available 
in accordance with journal policies and study ethics approvals. Results will be 
presented to relevant government authorities with an interest in 
cost-effectiveness of these types of interventions.

University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the acromegaly mortality rates with those expected for the 
general population from studies published before and after 2008.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and included observational studies in 
which the number of deaths observed in acromegaly was compared with the expected 
mortality for the general population mortality observed/expected (O/E). The 
following electronic databases were used as our data sources: EMBASE, MEDLINE 
and LILACS. From the observed and expected deaths, we recalculated all 
standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and their respective confidence intervals 
(95% CI), which were plotted in a meta-analysis using the software RevMan 5.3.
RESULTS: We identified 2303 references, and 26 studies fulfilled our eligibility 
criteria. From the 17 studies published before 2008, the mortality in acromegaly 
was increased, while from the nine studies published after 2008, the mortality 
was not different from the general population (SMR: 1.35, CI: 0.99-1.85). In six 
studies where somatostatin analogs (SAs) were used as adjuvant treatment, 
acromegaly mortality was not increased (SMR: 0.98, CI: 0.83-1.15), whereas in 
series including only patients treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy, 
mortality was significantly higher (SMR: 2.11; CI: 1.54-2.91). In studies 
published before and after 2008, the mortality was not increased in patients who 
achieved biochemical control, while it was higher in those with active disease. 
Cancer has become a leader cause of deaths in acromegaly patients in the last 
decade, period in which life expectancy improved.
CONCLUSION: Mortality in acromegaly is normalized with biochemical control and 
decreased in the last decade with the more frequent use of SAs as adjuvant 
therapy. Increased life expectancy has been associated with more deaths due to 
cancer.

Welfare, Japan.

[Purpose] An estimation model of the knee and ankle joint angles during the 
extension phase was proposed in the previous study. However, it had limited use 
because of the fixed initial lower limb angle before standing up. This study 
aimed to propose a new estimation model of the initial lower limb angle to 
improve the angle estimation during extension phase. [Subjects and Methods] 
Seven healthy male volunteers were enrolled. The new estimation model 
approximated the initial lower limb angle using a force sensor plate that 
measured the plantar pressure of the subjects. The estimated angle and force 
were compared to those obtained by a motion capture system and force plate. 
[Results] The new estimation model of initial lower limb angle showed no 
significant difference compared with the true values obtained by motion capture, 
except for the subject who had a greater foot-pressure measurement error 
compared with the force plate measurement, with maximum errors of 5.98° and 
6.31°, respectively. [Conclusion] The proposed model in this study can estimate 
the initial lower limb angle before standing and can be applied to the angle 
estimation model during the extension phase of the standing-up movement.

Author information:
(1)Center for Laboratory Medicine, Hemophilia and Hemostasis Center, St. Gallen, 
Switzerland.

In the last couple of years, several extended half-life factor VIII and factor 
IX preparations were intensively studied and gained approval. In order to extend 
half-lives, techniques like fusion to protein conjugates (Fc part of IgG1 or 
albumin), chemical modification (PEGylation), and protein sequence modification 
are implemented. With these techniques, it is possible to extend half-lives of 
factor IX products 4- to 6- fold, while half-life extension of factor VIII 
products is limited to 1.5- to 2-fold due to their interaction with von 
Willebrand factor. Nevertheless, both extended half-life factor VIII and IX 
products have improved and facilitated prophylactic factor replacement therapy 
in hemophilia A and B, respectively. Extended half-life factor concentrates pose 
challenges to coagulation laboratories because accurate therapy monitoring is 
not possible with all factor activity assays currently used.

INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C (HCV) infection adversely affects survival among 
people living with HIV, increasing mortality risk due to liver-related causes. 
In Poland HCV is found among ~30% of HIV infected individuals, with only a small 
percentage successfully treated for this coinfection. This study aimed to 
analyze the HCV-associated influence on the life expectancy among HIV/HCV 
coinfected patients from northwestern Poland.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Longitudinal data of 701 (368 HIV monoinfected and 368 
HIV/HCV coinfected) patients were investigated to assess the life expectancy and 
survival after HIV diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier and Cox analyses were used to assess 
the mortality risk in both unadjusted and multivariate models. Effect plots 
indicate the adjusted hazard ratio for HCV-associated survival.
RESULTS: Overall mortality was significantly higher among HCV coinfected 
(22.52%) compared to HIV monoinfected (10.32%) cases (p < 0.001, OR = 2.52 (95% 
CI: 1.65-3.85)), with shorter life expectancy among HIV/HCV infected patients 
(median: 55.4 (IQR: 42.8-59.1) years) compared to HIV monoinfection (median 72.7 
(IQR: 60.4-76.8) years, univariate HR = 4.15 (95% CI: 2.7-6.38), p < 0.0001, 
adjusted HR = 2.32 (95% CI: 1.47-3.65), p < 0.0001). After HIV diagnosis, HCV 
adversely influenced the survival after 15 years of follow-up, with a 
strengthened impact in the subsequent 5 years (univariate HR = 1.57 (95% CI: 
1.05-2.34) p = 0.026 for the 20-year survival time point, adjusted HR = 2.21 
(95% CI: 1.18-4.13), p = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients living with HIV, HCV coinfection is associated with 
a median life expectancy decrease of 17.3 years and low probability of surviving 
until the age of 65 years. In the era of directly acting anti-HCV drugs, 
treatment scale-up and immediacy of treatment are advisable in this cohort.

BACKGROUND: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improved the survival of 
patients with germ cell testicular cancer. However, long term side effects of 
chemotherapy have non-negligible impact on the quality of life of these young 
patients, who have a long life expectancy after being successfully treated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 25-OH vitamin D, testosterone, FSH and LH of patients 
with testicular cancer were retrospectively evaluated and for each patient 
clinical information were collected. The tissue of 52 patients with germ cell 
tumors was analyzed for VDR expression by immunohistochemistry. The serum 25-OH 
vitamin D and VDR expression were correlated to the patients 'clinical 
characteristics.
RESULTS: 25-OH vitamin D was analyzed in 82 patients. Insufficient (< 30 ng/ml) 
levels were detected in 65%-85%, mild deficient (< 20 ng/ml) in 25%-36% and 
severe deficient (< 10 ng/ml) in 6%-18% of the patients over a median follow-up 
of 48 months. No difference in serum 25-OH vitamin D was detected over the 
follow-up time points. No correlation with histology, stage and type of 
treatment was found. The 25-OH vitamin D levels were not correlated to 
testosterone, FSH and LH levels. Interestingly, the expression of VDR was much 
higher in non seminoma than in seminoma tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with testicular cancer have reduced vitamin D levels after 
the treatment of the primary cancer. Since long term hypovitaminosis D leads to 
high risk of fractures, infertility and cardiovascular diseases, we envision 
that vitamin D should be regularly checked in patients with testicular cancer 
and replaced if needed.

Vascularization of the trachea in the bottlenose dolphin: comparison with bovine 
and evidence for evolutionary adaptations to diving.

The rigid structure of the mammalian trachea is functional to maintain constant 
patency and airflow during breathing, but no gas exchange takes place through 
its walls. The structure of the organ in dolphins shows increased rigidity of 
the tracheal cartilaginous rings and the presence of vascular lacunae in the 
submucosa. However, no actual comparison was ever made between the size and 
capacity of the vascular lacunae of the dolphin trachea and the potentially 
homologous structures of terrestrial mammals. In the present study, the 
extension of the lacunae has been compared between the bottlenose dolphin and 
the bovine, a closely related terrestrial Cetartiodactyla. Our results indicate 
that the extension of the blood spaces in the submucosa of dolphins is over 12 
times larger than in the corresponding structure of the bovines. Furthermore, a 
microscopic analysis revealed the presence of valve-like structures in the walls 
of the cetacean lacunae. The huge difference in size suggests that the lacunae 
are not merely a product of individual physiological plasticity, but may 
constitute a true adaptive evolutionary character, functional to life in the 
aquatic environment. The presence of valve-like structures may be related to the 
regulation of blood flow, and curtail excessive compression under baric stress 
at depth.

BACKGROUND: As global life expectancy increases, older people with chronic 
diseases are being required to manage multiple and complex medicine regimes. 
However, polypharmacy raises the risk of medicine-related problems and 
preventable hospital admissions. To improve medicine use, English community 
pharmacies are commissioned to deliver Medicines Use Reviews (MURs), which are 
typically delivered from the pharmacy. People who are homebound rarely receive 
the service. This paper describes the uptake and impact of a pilot project that 
seeks to provide domiciliary Medicines Use Reviews (dMURs).
METHODS: Participating pharmacists collected data on their dMUR activity over a 
12-month period. Outcome measures (eg, adherence, side-effects, pharmacist 
assessment of preventable hospital admissions) were recorded. Pharmacists were 
also invited to submit written testimonies of their experiences of undertaking 
dMURs.
RESULTS: Out of 433 possible pharmacies eligible to take part in the pilot, 186 
pharmacies expressed an interest, and 91 actively engaged in providing the dMUR 
service. The total number of dMURs performed were 1092 (mean number performed by 
each pharmacy was 12). Two thirds of patients reported problems and concerns 
about side-effects and missed doses regarding their medicines. Pharmacists' 
assessment to prevent hospital admissions found that over one-third of the dMURs 
had contributed towards preventing either a possible or likely emergency 
hospital admission. Twelve pharmacists' testimonies were submitted providing 
context of the problems patients faced with medicines.
DISCUSSION: dMURs are feasible and improve patient medicines use. The results 
indicate that dMUR potentially prevents hospital admissions and readmissions. 
dMURs offer an opportunity to support the self-care agenda and ensure homebound 
patients can successfully manage their medicines.
