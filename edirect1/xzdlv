Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) remain a significant cause of morbidity and 
mortality in many low-income and middle-income countries. Several NTDs, namely 
lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted 
helminthiases (STH) and trachoma, are predominantly controlled by preventive 
chemotherapy (or mass drug administration), following recommendations set by the 
WHO. Over one billion people are now treated for NTDs with this strategy per 
year. However, further investment and increased domestic healthcare spending are 
urgently needed to continue these programmes. Consequently, it is vital that the 
cost-effectiveness of preventive chemotherapy is understood. We analyse the 
current estimates on the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of the 
preventive chemotherapy strategies predominantly used for these diseases and 
identify key evidence gaps that require further research. Overall, the reported 
estimates show that preventive chemotherapy is generally cost-effective, 
supporting WHO recommendations. More specifically, the cost per DALY averted 
estimates relating to community-wide preventive chemotherapy for lymphatic 
filariasis and onchocerciasis were particularly favourable when compared with 
other public health interventions. Cost per DALY averted estimates of 
school-based preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis and STH were also 
generally favourable but more variable. Notably, the broader socioeconomic 
benefits are likely not being fully captured by the DALYs averted metric. No 
estimates of cost per DALY averted relating to community-wide mass antibiotic 
treatment for trachoma were found, highlighting the need for further research. 
These findings are important for informing global health policy and support the 
need for continuing NTD control and elimination efforts.

Non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTAP) has gained attention as a decontamination 
and shelf-life extension technology. In this study its effect on psychrotrophic 
histamine-producing bacteria (HPB) and histamine formation in fish stored at 
0-5°C was evaluated. Mackerel filets were artificially inoculated with 
Morganella psychrotolerans and Photobacterium phosphoreum and exposed to NTAP to 
evaluate its effect on their viability and the histidine decarboxylase (HDC) 
activity in broth cultures and the accumulation of histamine in fish samples, 
stored on melting ice or at fridge temperature (5°C). NTAP treatment was made 
under wet conditions for 30 min, using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) 
reactor. The voltage output was characterized by a peak-to-peak value of 13.8 kV 
(fundamental frequency around 12.7 KHz). This treatment resulted in a 
significant reduction of the number of M. psychrotolerans and P. phosphoreum (≈3 
log cfu/cm2) on skin samples that have been prewashed with surfactant (SDS) or 
SDS and lactic acid. A marked reduction of their histamine-producing potential 
was also observed in HDC broth incubated at either 20 or 5°C. Lower accumulation 
of histamine was observed in NTAP-treated mackerel filets that have been 
inoculated with M. psychrotolerans or P. phosphoreum and pre-washed with either 
normal saline or SDS solution (0.05% w/v) and stored at 5°C for 10 days. Mean 
histamine level in treated and control groups for the samples inoculated with 
either M. psychrotolerans or P. phosphoreum (≈5 log cfu/g) varied from 7 to 32 
and from 49 to 66 μg/g, respectively. No synergistic effect of SDS was observed 
in the challenge test on meat samples. Any detectable amount of histamine was 
produced in the meat samples held at melting ice temperature (0-2°C) for 7 days. 
The effects of NTAP on the quality properties of mackerel's filets were 
negligible, whereas its effect on the psychrotrophic HPB might be useful when 
time and environmental conditions are challenging for the cool-keeping capacity 
throughout the transport/storage period.

BACKGROUND: : Disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) inequalities by 
socioeconomic deprivation are widening, alongside rising prevalence of multiple 
long-term conditions (MLTCs). We use longitudinal data to assess whether MLTCs 
contribute to the widening DFLE inequalities by socioeconomic deprivation.
METHODS: : The Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS I and II) are large 
population-based studies of those ≥65 years, conducted in three areas in 
England. Baseline occurred in 1991 (CFAS I, n=7635) and 2011 (CFAS II, n=7762) 
with two-year follow-up. We defined disability as difficulty in activities of 
daily living, MLTCs as the presence of at least two of nine health conditions, 
and socioeconomic deprivation by area-level deprivation tertiles. DFLE and 
transitions between disability states and death were estimated from multistate 
models.
FINDINGS: : For people with MLTCs, inequalities in DFLE at age 65 between the 
most and least affluent widened to around 2.5 years (men:2.4 years, 95% 
confidence interval (95%CI) 0.4-4.4; women:2.6 years, 95%CI 0.7-4.5) by 2011. 
Incident disability reduced for the most affluent women (Relative Risk Ratio 
(RRR):0.6, 95%CI 0.4-0.9), and mortality with disability reduced for least 
affluent men (RRR:0.6, 95%CI 0.5-0.8). MLTCs prevalence increased only for least 
affluent men (1991: 58.8%, 2011: 66.9%) and women (1991: 60.9%, 2011: 69.1%). 
However, DFLE inequalities were as large in people without MLTCs (men:2.4 years, 
95%CI 0.3-4.5; women:3.1 years, 95% CI 0.8-5.4).
INTERPRETATION: : Widening DFLE inequalities were not solely due to MLTCs. 
Reduced disability incidence with MLTCs is possible but was only achieved in the 
most affluent.

BACKGROUND: Gender plays a well-recognized role in shaping health inequities. 
However, the population-level health consequences of gender inequalities have 
not been measured comprehensively. The goal of this study was to evaluate the 
association between gender inequality and health indicators in organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.
METHODS: Ecological study based on 1990-2017 panel data for OECD member 
countries. Gender inequality was measured using the Gender Inequality Index 
(GII). The population health parameters evaluated were life expectancy (LE), 
healthy life expectancy (HALE), years of life lost (YLL), years lived with 
disability (YLD), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and specific-cause 
mortality. Two-way fixed-effects linear models were used to assess the 
relationship between gender inequality and health outcomes. Models included 
potential mediating and confounding factors such as health spending, political 
model, and income inequalities.
FINDINGS: Greater gender inequality was associated with lower LE (-0·49%; CI95 
-0·63%- -0·31%; p-value < 0·0001), HALE (-0·47%; CI95 -0·63%- -0·31%; p-value 
< 0·0001) and with increased premature mortality YLL (6·82%; CI95 3·63%-10·75%; 
p-value < 0·0001) and morbidity measured in DALYs (1·50%; CI95 0·48%-2·46%; 
p-value = 0·0028) and YLD (2·59%; CI95 0·67%-4·77%; p-value = 0·0063) for each 
0·1 increments on the GII. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the results 
were robust to the various specifications of the causal models.
INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that gender inequality pose a sizable impact 
on population health outcomes. Promoting gender equality as part of public 
policies is vital for optimizing health on a population scale.

Background Optimal management of asymptomatic Brugada syndrome (BrS) with 
spontaneous type I electrocardiographic pattern is uncertain. Methods and 
Results We developed an individual-level simulation comprising 2 000 000 
average-risk individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I 
electrocardiographic pattern. We compared (1) observation, (2) 
electrophysiologic study (EPS)-guided implantable cardioverter-defibrillator 
(ICD), and (3) upfront ICD, each using either subcutaneous or transvenous ICD, 
resulting in 6 strategies tested. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), with cardiac deaths (arrest or procedural-related) as a secondary 
outcome. We varied BrS diagnosis age and underlying arrest rate. We assessed 
cost-effectiveness at $100 000/QALY. Compared with observation, EPS-guided 
subcutaneous ICD resulted in 0.35 QALY gain/individual and 4130 cardiac deaths 
avoided/100 000 individuals, and EPS-guided transvenous ICD resulted in 0.26 
QALY gain and 3390 cardiac deaths avoided. Compared with observation, upfront 
ICD reduced cardiac deaths by a greater margin (subcutaneous ICD, 8950; 
transvenous ICD, 6050), but only subcutaneous ICD improved QALYs (subcutaneous 
ICD, 0.25 QALY gain; transvenous ICD, 0.01 QALY loss), and complications were 
higher. ICD-based strategies were more effective at younger ages and higher 
arrest rates (eg, using subcutaneous devices, upfront ICD was the most effective 
strategy at ages 20-39.4 years and arrest rates >1.37%/year; EPS-guided ICD was 
the most effective strategy at ages 39.5-51.3 years and arrest rates 
0.47%-1.37%/year, and observation was the most effective strategy at ages >51.3 
years and arrest rates <0.47%/year). EPS-guided subcutaneous ICD was 
cost-effective ($80 508/QALY). Conclusions Device-based approaches (with or 
without EPS risk stratification) can be more effective than observation among 
selected patients with asymptomatic BrS. BrS management should be tailored to 
patient characteristics.

Biological nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase has attracted attention as an 
alternative method to chemical nitrogen fixation, which requires large amounts 
of fossil fuels. Azotobacter vinelandii, which produces an oxygen-sensitive 
nitrogenase, can fix nitrogen even under aerobic conditions; therefore, the 
heterologous expression of nif-related genes from A. vinelandii is a promising 
strategy for developing a biological nitrogen fixation method. We assembled 17 
nif-related genes, which are scattered throughout the genome of A. vinelandii, 
into synthetic gene clusters by overlap-extension-PCR and seamless cloning and 
expressed them in Escherichia coli. The transcription and translation of the 17 
nif-related genes were evaluated by RT-qPCR and LC-MS/MS, respectively. The 
constructed E. coli showed nitrogenase activity under anaerobic and microaerobic 
conditions. This strain would be a useful model for examining the effect of 
other genes from A. vinelandii on nitrogen fixation by expressing them in 
addition to the minimal set of nif-related genes.

OBJECTIVE: To review research progress of surgical treatment of patellar 
fractures.
METHODS: The domestic and foreign literature about patellar fracture treatment 
in recent years was extensively consulted, and the advantages, disadvantages, 
and indications of various surgical treatments were summarized.
RESULTS: The patella plays an important role in knee flexion and extension 
activities, and the fracture significantly affects the patient's quality of 
life. At present, the surgical methods include open reduction and internal 
fixation and patella resection. The internal fixation methods include 
ring/binding patella fixation, tension band wiring and improved technology, 
tension band wiring combined with other methods, screw fixation (including 
absorbable screws), steel plate fixation, and patella fixator fixation. Each 
surgical method has different indications, advantages, and disadvantages. 
Choosing an appropriate treatment plan plays a crucial role in clinical 
prognosis.
CONCLUSION: There are many surgical treatments for patellar fractures. In order 
to improve the effectiveness and reduce postoperative complications, it is 
necessary to choose the most appropriate treatment strategy for the type of 
fracture.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common and burdensome 
illness. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of the US Food and Drug 
Administration-approved CIC drugs to evaluate and quantify treatment preferences 
compared with usual care from insurer and patient perspectives.
METHODS: We evaluated the subset of patients with CIC and documented failure of 
over-the-counter (OTC) osmotic or bulk-forming laxatives. A RAND/UCLA consensus 
panel of 8 neurogastroenterologists informed model design. Treatment outcomes 
and costs were defined using integrated analyses of registered clinical trials 
and the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-supported cost databases. 
Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using health utilities 
derived from clinical trials. A 12-week time horizon was used.
RESULTS: With continued OTC laxatives, CIC-related costs were $569 from an 
insurer perspective compared with $3,154 from a patient perspective (considering 
lost wages and out-of-pocket expenses). CIC prescription drugs increased insurer 
costs by $618-$1,015 but decreased patient costs by $327-$1,117. Effectiveness 
of CIC drugs was similar (0.02 QALY gained/12 weeks or ∼7 healthy days 
gained/year). From an insurer perspective, prescription drugs (linaclotide, 
prucalopride, and plecanatide) seemed less cost-effective than continued OTC 
laxatives (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio >$150,000/QALY gained). From a 
patient perspective, the cost-effective algorithm started with plecanatide, 
followed by choosing between prucalopride and linaclotide starting at the 145-μg 
dose (favoring prucalopride among patients whose disease affects their work 
productivity). The patient perspective was driven by drug tolerability and 
treatment effects on quality of life.
DISCUSSION: Addressing costs at a policy level has the potential to enable 
patients and clinicians to move from navigating barriers in treatment access 
toward truly optimizing treatment choice.

BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and/or coronary heart 
disease (CHD) are at high risk to develop major depression. Preventing incident 
major depression may be an important tool in reducing the personal and societal 
burden of depression. The aim of the current study was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of a stepped care program to prevent major depression 
(Step-Dep) in diabetes mellitus type 2 and/or coronary heart disease patients 
with subthreshold depression in comparison with usual care.
METHODS: An economic evaluation with 12 months follow-up was conducted alongside 
a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial from a societal perspective. 
Participants received care as usual (n = 140) or Step-Dep (n = 96) which 
consisted of four sequential treatment steps: watchful waiting, guided 
self-help, problem solving treatment and referral to a general practitioner. 
Primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cumulative 
incidence of major depression. Costs were measured every 3 months. Missing data 
was imputed using multiple imputation. Uncertainty around cost-effectiveness 
outcomes was estimated using bootstrapping and presented in cost-effectiveness 
planes and acceptability curves.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in QALYs or depression incidence 
between treatment groups. Secondary care costs (mean difference €1644, 95% CI 
€344; €3370) and informal care costs (mean difference €1930, 95% CI €528; €4089) 
were significantly higher in the Step-Dep group than in the usual care group. 
The difference in total societal costs (€1001, 95% CI €-3975; €6409) was not 
statistically significant. The probability of the Step-Dep intervention being 
cost-effective was low, with a maximum of 0.41 at a ceiling ratio of €30,000 per 
QALY gained and 0.32 at a ceiling ratio of €0 per prevented case of major 
depression.
CONCLUSIONS: The Step-Dep intervention is not cost-effective compared to usual 
care in a population of patients with DM2/CHD and subthreshold depression. 
Therefore, widespread implementation cannot be recommended.

Many pollinator populations are experiencing declines, emphasizing the need for 
a better understanding of the complex relationship between bees and flowering 
plants. Using DNA metabarcoding to describe plant-pollinator interactions 
eliminates many challenges associated with traditional methods and has the 
potential to reveal a more comprehensive understanding of foraging behaviour and 
pollinator life history. Here we use DNA metabarcoding of ITS2 and rbcL gene 
regions to identify plant species present in pollen loads of 404 bees from three 
habitats in eastern Oregon. Our specific objectives were to (i) determine 
whether plant species identified using DNA metabarcoding are consistent with 
plant species identified using observations, (ii) compare characterizations of 
diet breadth derived from foraging observations to those based on plant species 
assignments obtained using DNA metabarcoding, and (iii) compare plant species 
assignments produced by DNA metabarcoding using a "regional" reference database 
to those produced using a "local" database. At the three locations, 31%-86% of 
foraging observations were consistent with DNA metabarcoding data, 8%-50% of 
diet breadth characterizations based on observations differed from those based 
on DNA metabarcoding data, and 22%-25% of plant species detected using the 
regional database were not known to occur in the study area in question. 
Plant-pollinator networks produced from DNA metabarcoding data had higher 
sampling completeness and significantly lower specialization than networks based 
on observations. Here, we examine some strengths and limitations of using DNA 
metabarcoding to identify plant species present in bee pollen loads, make 
ecological inferences about foraging behaviour and provide guidance for future 
research.

People with mental illness experience a shorter life expectancy compared to the 
general population. Poor physical health trajectory emerges following the onset 
of psychosis and is further compounded by the initiation of antipsychotic 
treatment. Young people are particularly at risk as the onset of mental illness 
mostly occurs between the age of 12 and 25 years. This represents a crucial 
period for early intervention to prevent a physical ill health trajectory. 
Furthermore, those who are at ultra-high risk for psychosis should also be 
targeted for early intervention. Lifestyle interventions have been identified as 
the first-line physical health promotion practice for improving the physical 
health of people with severe mental illness. The aim of this study was to 
conduct a scoping review following the JBI methodological guidance on scoping 
reviews to explore the current literature on lifestyle intervention trialled for 
early psychosis, including first-episode psychosis and those who are at 
ultra-high risk for psychosis. This review also explores the extent of 
literature examining physical health literacy in this specific population. The 
literature search was conducted on Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Scopus. 
Twenty-two studies were included for the purpose of this scoping review, 21 of 
which examined the effects of lifestyle interventions and one of which reported 
on physical health literacy. This scoping review indicates the need for 
co-designed lifestyle interventions with the involvement of service users, 
families and carers and a focus on promoting physical health literacy, social 
support, and an incorporation of a health behaviour change model focus on 
promoting autonomous motivation. The findings of this study can inform future 
development of a novel co-designed lifestyle intervention for the targeted 
population.

OBJECTIVES: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in the neck and shoulder region may 
be associated with significant impairment of quality of life and well-being. The 
study was to determine the prevalence of painful MSDs in Chinese dentists and 
evaluate somatosensory function and neck mobility compared with non-dental 
professional controls.
METHODS: One hundred dentists (age: 36.5 ± 9.8 years) and 102 controls (age: 
36.2 ± 10.0 years) were recruited between September 2019 and December 2020. The 
Medical Outcome Study 36-item short-form health survey questionnaire and 
information of MSDs history were recorded. The cervical range of motion (CROM) 
with and without pain, and the pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) of the facial and 
neck muscles were tested. Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test and multiple 
linear regression analysis were used to analyze the data. The factors in the 
multiple linear regression analysis were occupation, working age, and gender.
RESULTS: The prevalence rate of neck pain was significantly higher in dentists 
(73.0%) compared with the controls (52.0%) (P = .002). The regression models of 
cervical range of posterior extension, lateral flexion and rotation were 
statistically significant (P ≤ .001). The regression models of PPTs of the 
tested facial and neck muscles were statistically significant (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Dentists are at higher risk of neck pain. The bigger cervical range 
of left rotation of dentists could be related to the working posture. The lower 
PPTs in dentists may reflect a hypersensitivity in the facial and neck muscles. 
Preventive measures are needed to reduce occupational hazards in dentists.

Message frames are often used to communicate about invasive species due to the 
additional meaning they provide. They appear in calls to action like "join the 
battle against invasive species," "unwelcome exotics," or "Stop Aquatic 
Hitchhikers." However, little is known about how stakeholders respond to these 
message frames. This research tested five common message emphasis frames used in 
invasive species communication. These message frames were placed in social media 
advertisements about zebra mussels to determine the impact each message frame 
had on user online behavior. For cost-per-click (CPC), ANOVA showed effects for 
framing and gender. Model coefficients revealed that Hitchhiker and Protective 
had significantly higher CPC than Science, and that women had a higher CPC. For 
comments, ANOVA showed effects for framing and gender. Model coefficients 
revealed that no frame had a significantly different effect on comments than 
Science, and that women commented on posts less. For shares, ANOVA showed 
effects for framing. Model coefficients revealed that Hitchhiker was shared more 
than Science. It is important to note that neither Militaristic nor Nativist 
outperformed Science on any measured outcome. Coupled with ethical 
considerations, our results suggest the use of Nativist and Militaristic frames 
are not necessary to influence online behavior. Message frames without ethical 
issues can be used to achieve the outcomes we tested without compromising 
message effectiveness. Within this article, we provide background on commonly 
used invasive species message frames, explain our methods for testing how they 
impact user behavior, and suggest limitations and applications of this work.

PURPOSE: Clinicians face personal barriers that impede the provision of 
bereavement care and require education in hospice care. This study aims to 
investigate the effects of an educational bereavement program on emotional and 
cognitive barriers, self-efficacy, and professional quality of life among 
clinicians in hospice care.
METHODS: A pretest-posttest design was implemented. A total of 194 clinicians 
with working experience in hospice care were recruited. The participants 
underwent a 12-h workshop. The content included lectures, role-play, and group 
discussion. Emotional and cognitive barriers, self-efficacy, and professional 
quality of life were measured before and after the program and at 3-month 
follow-up.
RESULTS: After the educational program, negative emotional barriers (F (2, 
386) = 17.07, p < 0.001), lack of ability (F (2, 386) = 20.11, p < 0.001), 
belief in avoidance (F (2, 386) = 7.10, p = 0.001), outcome expectancy (F (2, 
386) = 11.32, p < 0.001), and burnout (F (2, 386) = 5.59, p = 0.005) decreased 
significantly. Self-efficacy (F (2, 386) = 5.37, p = 0.006) and compassion 
satisfaction (F (2, 386) = 127.99, p < 0.001) increased significantly.
CONCLUSION: The educational program addressed personal barriers to bereavement 
care. Role-play and group discussion about emotional and cognitive barriers can 
reduce barriers and improve self-efficacy in clinicians in hospice care.

BACKGROUND: Up to 70% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients develop vertebral 
metastasis and subsequent pathological vertebral fractures (PVF). With 
contemporary systemic therapies, life expectancy of MM patients has improved 
drastically, and the need to manage pain and associated disability from PVF is 
increasingly a high priority. The aim of this review is to provide an updated 
comprehensive synthesis of evidence in the use of vertebral augmentation, 
including percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), to 
treat MM-related PVF.
METHODS: A comprehensive multi-database search in accordance with PRISMA 
guidelines was performed up to 10 February 2021. Relevant English language 
articles were selected and critically reviewed.
FINDINGS: A total of 23 clinical studies have been included in the review. PV 
and BKP showed significant pain and functional improvements in terms of 
analgesia requirements, Cervical Spine Function Score, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group scale, EQ-5D score, Karnofsky score, Neck Pain Disability Index, 
Oswestry Disability Index, Short form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire and VAS pain 
scale. Both procedures also reported promising radiographic outcomes in terms of 
vertebral height improvement, maintenance and restoration, as well as kyphotic 
deformity correction. Asymptomatic cement leakage was commonly reported. There 
was no significant difference between the two procedures.
CONCLUSION: PV and BKP are safe and effective procedure that offers pain relief, 
reduction in pain associated disability and reduction of fracture incidence. Its 
minimally invasive approach is associated with minimal morbidity risk, making it 
a viable option in frail patients.

BACKGROUND: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) 
prevent thromboembolic events, but are associated with significant risk of 
bleeding.
OBJECTIVES: To explore associations between a wide range of biomarkers and 
bleeding risk in patients with AF on OAC.
METHOD: Biomarkers were analyzed in a random sample of 4200 patients, 204 cases 
with major bleedings, from ARISTOTLE. The replication cohort included 344 cases 
with major bleeding and 1024 random controls from RE-LY. Plasma samples obtained 
at randomization were analyzed by the Olink Proximity Extension Assay 
cardiovascular and inflammation panels and conventional immunoassays. The 
associations between biomarker levels and major bleeding over 1 to 3 years of 
follow-up were evaluated by random survival forest/Boruta analyses and Cox 
regression analyses to assess linear associations and hazard ratios for 
identified biomarkers.
RESULTS: Out of 268 proteins, nine biomarkers were independently associated with 
bleeding in both cohorts. In the replication cohort the linear hazard ratios 
(95% confidence intervals) per interquartile range were for these biomarkers: 
TNF-R1 1.748 (1.456, 2.098), GDF-15 1.653 (1.377, 1.985), EphB4 1.575 (1.320, 
1.880), suPAR 1.548 (1.294, 1.851), OPN 1.476 (1.240, 1.757), OPG 1.397 (1.156, 
1.688), TNF-R2 1.360 (1.144,1.616), cTnT-hs 1.232 (1.067, 1.423), and TRAIL-R2 
1.202 (1.069, 1.351).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AF on OAC, GDF-15, cTnT-hs, and seven novel 
biomarkers were independently associated with major bleedings and reflect 
pathophysiologic processes of inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, 
vascular calcification, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Investigations of the 
utility of these markers to refine risk stratification and guide the management 
of patients at high risk of bleeding are warranted.

In Greece, the provision of mental health shows inefficiencies in remote and 
inaccessible areas due to the lack of appropriate structures and access to 
healthcare. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the 
Mobile Mental Health Units (MMHUs) in Cyclades with and without MMHUs' operation 
based on Real-World Evidence (RWE). The study population consisted of 724 people 
who visited the MMHUs of the western and northeastern Cyclades in 2015. The data 
derived from the patients' medical records of EPAPSY classified by International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision 
(ICD-10) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. The analysis 
revealed that 60.9% of the participants were women and the average age was 50.1. 
50.4% of the people who visited MMHUs without referral from primary health care 
professionals and 18.8% with referral. The calculation of effectiveness was 
based on DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) and was performed according to 
the World Health Organization methodology. In the specific population, there are 
no recorded deaths caused by mental disorders and thus DALYs are equal to Years 
Lost due to Disability (YLDs) with MMHUs' operation. 18% of the population was 
diagnosed with mood disorders (F30-F39) and morbidity burden 9.49 (YLDs), while 
17.5% of the patients were diagnosed with neurotic, stress-related and 
somatoform disorders (F40-F48) and corresponding morbidity burden 4.53 (YLDs). 
Our results revealed that the effectiveness of MMHUs corresponds to 17.98 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted in 2015. The mood disorders and 
the neurotic, stress-related disorders have shown a high morbidity burden. 
Advanced age, non-permanent employment, existence of psychopathology in the 
family and referral on patients' own will were found to significantly affect the 
mental health status of the participants. The implementation and expansion of 
flexible and alternative community-based interventions, such as MMHUs, 
constitute a best practice both for obtaining higher clinical outcomes and for 
facing regional inefficiencies related to population's access to healthcare.

BACKGROUND: The determinants of access to immunizers are still poorly 
understood, leading to questions about which criteria were considered in this 
distribution. Given the above, the present study aimed to analyze the 
determinants of access to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by different countries.
METHODS: The study covered 189 countries using data from different public 
databases, and collected until February 19, 2021. We used eight explanatory 
variables: gross domestic product (GDP), extreme poverty, human development 
index (HDI), life expectancy, median age, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
cases, COVID-19 tests, and COVID-19 deaths. The endogenous variables were total 
vaccine doses, vaccine doses per thousand, and days of vaccination. The 
structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was applied to establish the causal 
relationship between the country's COVID-19 impact, socioeconomic variables, and 
vaccine access. To support SEM, we used confirmatory factor analysis, t-test, 
and Pearson's correlation.
RESULTS: We collected the sample on February 19, and to date, 80 countries 
(42.1%) had already received a batch of immunizers against COVID-19. The 
countries with first access to the vaccine (e.g., number of days elapsed since 
they took the first dose) were the United Kingdom (68), China (68), Russia (66), 
and Israel (62). The countries receiving the highest doses were the United 
States, China, India, and Israel. The countries with extreme poverty had lower 
access to vaccines and the richer countries gained priority access. Countries 
most affected by COVID (deaths and cases) also received immunizers earlier and 
in greater volumes. Unfortunately, similar to other vaccines, indicators, such 
as income, poverty, and human development, influence vaccines' access. Thus 
affecting the population of vulnerable and less protected countries. Therefore, 
global initiatives for the equitable distribution of COVID need to be discussed 
and encouraged.
CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of vaccine distribution consider the impact of the 
disease in the country and are also affected by favorable socioeconomic 
indicators. The COVID-19 vaccines need to be accessible to all affected 
countries, regardless of their social hands.
