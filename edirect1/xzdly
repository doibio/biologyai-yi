level was found to be an independent poor prognostic factor at 1 year after

BACKGROUND: As a first-line surgical treatment for treating metacarpophalangeal 
(MCP) joint extension contractures, mobilization surgery with open dorsal 
approach has been indicated. However, this procedure has the possibility to 
result in postoperative recurrence over the course of time because its invasive 
open dorsal approach has a negative impact on the postoperative gliding of the 
extensor mechanism. We report the preliminarily outcomes of patients who 
underwent a minimally invasive arthroscopic mobilization to alter and enhance 
their existing surgical strategy in place of MCP joint extension contractures.
METHODS: This retrospective study included seven patients with 13 MCP joint 
extension contractures who had received an arthroscopic release of the bilateral 
collateral ligament and/or dorsal capsule of affected MCP joint. The extension 
contractures were caused by long-time immobilization with inadequate extended 
position of the MCP joint after either hand and wrist fractures, extensor tendon 
injury, or peripheral nerve palsy. All patients received sufficient exercise 
under the supervision of a physical therapist for more than 3 months before 
surgery. However, physical therapy did not improve the MCP joint extension 
contractures. We measured the active and passive flexion angles preoperatively 
at 1 and 6 months after surgery. The passive flexion angle was also measured 
after arthroscopic mobilization on the operation table. Surgery-related 
complications regarding nerve, vessel, skin, and tendon were also assessed.
RESULTS: In all patients, significant improvements were observed in both the 
active and passive flexion angles 1 month after surgery, and continued to 
improve 6 months after surgery. Two out of 13 metacarpophalangeal joints 
developed blisters on the dorsal side of the joint, but conservatively 
recovered.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the positive improvements observed in our patients, we 
conclude that this minimally invasive arthroscopic technique has the potential 
to alter and enhance the surgical treatment strategy for MCP joint extension 
contractures.

OBJECTIVE: The Surprise Question (SQ) is a prognostic screening tool used to 
identify patients with limited life expectancy. We assessed the SQ's performance 
predicting 1-year mortality among patients in ambulatory heart failure (HF) 
clinics. We determined that the SQ's performance changes according to sex and 
other demographic (age) and clinical characteristics, mainly left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional 
classifications.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in two HF clinics. To assess 
the performance of the SQ in predicting 1-year mortality, we calculated the 
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and the 
positive and negative predictive values. To illustrate if the results of the SQ 
changes the probability that a patient dies within 1 year, we created Fagan's 
nomograms. We report the results from the overall sample and for subgroups 
according to sex, age, LVEF and NYHA functional class.
RESULTS: We observed that the SQ showed a sensitivity of 85% identifying 
ambulatory patients with HF who are in the last year of life. We determined that 
the SQ's performance predicting 1-year mortality was similar among women and 
men. The SQ performed better for patients aged under 70 years, for patients with 
reduced or mildly reduced ejection fraction, and for patients NYHA class III/IV.
CONCLUSIONS: We consider the tool an easy and fast first step to identify 
patients with HF who might benefit from an advance care planning discussion or a 
referral to palliative care due to limited life expectancy.

Acute heart failure (AHF) is a major cause of unplanned hospitalisations in the 
elderly and is associated with high mortality. Its prevalence has grown in the 
last years due to population aging and longer life expectancy of chronic heart 
failure patients. Although international societies have provided guidelines for 
the management of AHF in the general population, scientific evidence for 
geriatric patients is often lacking, as these are underrepresented in clinical 
trials. Elderly have a different risk profile with more comorbidities, 
disability, and frailty, leading to increased morbidity, longer recovery time, 
higher readmission rates, and higher mortality. Furthermore, therapeutic options 
are often limited, due to unfeasibility of invasive strategies, mechanical 
circulatory support and cardiac transplantation. Thus, the in-hospital 
management of AHF should be tailored to each patient's clinical situation, 
cardiopulmonary condition and geriatric assessment. Palliative care should be 
considered in some cases, in order to avoid unnecessary diagnostics and/or 
treatments. After discharge, a strict follow-up through outpatient clinic or 
telemedicine is can improve quality of life and reduce rehospitalisation rates. 
The aim of this review is to offer an insight on current literature and provide 
a clinically oriented, patient-tailored approach regarding assessment, treatment 
and follow-up of elderly patients admitted for AHF.

Objective: Lung cancer patients exhibit spinal metastases from a specific 
population, and with this study, we aimed to develop a model that can predict 
this particular group's survival. Methods: Data were retrospectively collected 
from 83 lung cancer patients who underwent spinal metastasis surgery at our 
center from 2009 to 2021. After the initial assessment of treatment and scoring 
effects, a nomogram for survival prediction was created by identifying and 
integrating critical prognostic factors, followed by a consistency index 
(C-index) to measure consistency, and finally, a subject working characteristic 
curve (ROC) to compare the predictive accuracy of the three existing models. 
Results: The mean postoperative survival was 14.7 months. Surgical treatment 
significantly improved the VAS and Frankel scores in lung cancer patients with 
spinal metastases. The revised Tokuhashi score underestimated the life 
expectancy of these patients. Six independent prognostic factors, including age, 
extraspinal bone metastasis foci, visceral metastasis, Frankel score, targeted 
therapy, and radiotherapy, were identified and incorporated into the model. 
Calibration curves for 3-, 6-, and 12-month overall survival showed a good 
concordance between predicted and actual risk. The nomogram C-index for the 
cohort study was 0.800 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.757-0.843). Model 
comparisons showed that the nomogram's prediction accuracy was better than 
revised Tokuhashi and Bauer's scoring systems. Conclusions: Spine surgery 
offered patients the possibility of regaining neurological function. Having 
identified shortcomings in existing scoring systems, we have recreated and 
validated a new nomogram that can be used to predict survival outcomes in 
patients with spinal metastases from lung cancer, thereby assisting spinal 
surgeons in making surgical decisions and personalizing treatment for these 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbours many genetic 
aberrations that can be targeted with systemic treatments. Whole-genome 
sequencing (WGS) can simultaneously detect these (and possibly new) molecular 
targets. However, the exact added clinical value of WGS is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the early cost 
effectiveness of using WGS in diagnostic strategies compared with currently used 
molecular diagnostics for patients with inoperable stage IIIB,C/IV non-squamous 
NSCLC from a Dutch healthcare perspective.
METHODS: A decision tree represented the diagnostic pathway, and a cohort state 
transition model represented disease progression. Three diagnostic strategies 
were modelled: standard of care (SoC) alone, WGS as a diagnostic test, and SoC 
followed by WGS. Treatment effectiveness was based on a systematic review. 
Probabilistic cost-effectiveness analyses were performed, and threshold analyses 
(using €80,000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) was used to explore the 
early cost effectiveness of WGS.
RESULTS: WGS as a diagnostic test resulted in more QALYs (0.002) and costs 
(€1534 [incremental net monetary benefit -€1349]), and SoC followed by WGS 
resulted in fewer QALYs (-0.002) and more costs (€1059 [-€1194]) compared with 
SoC alone. WGS as a diagnostic test was only cost effective if it was priced at 
€2000 per patient and identified 2.7% more actionable patients than SoC alone. 
Treating these additional identified patients with new treatments costing >€4069 
per month decreased the probability of cost effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that providing WGS as a diagnostic test is 
cost effective compared with SoC followed by WGS and SoC alone if costs for WGS 
decrease and additional patients with actionable targets are identified. This 
cost-effectiveness model can be used to incorporate new findings iteratively and 
to support ongoing decision making regarding the use of WGS in this rapidly 
evolving field.

An autopsy of the coloniality of suicide: Modernity's completed genocide.

X T(1), Polanco M(1).

Author information:
(1)San Diego State University, USA.

From the Latin American modernity/coloniality project, we address the 
inhospitality of the modern/colonial and globally designed world-system in 
relation to suicidality. In our vernacular Spanglish, guided by epistemological 
disobedience, and responding to epistemicide, we interpellate ourselves to 
unmask the hidden colonial structures of power of modernity's global design on 
suicide knowledge. Our intent is to argue, specifically from the perspective of 
coloniality and our racialized, gendered, and monetized bodies, that suicide is 
rather an extension of modernity's colonial genocide. From the decolonial geo 
and body-politics of knowledge, our discussion on modernity's Eurocentric 
rhetoric on suicide departs from the materialization of suicidality in our 
flesh. We story experiences of our bodies with life and pleas of death, within 
the context of our immigrant backgrounds, and as family therapists in the United 
States (U.S.). We adopt autopsy as an analogy from where to advance such 
analysis to contest Eurocentric configurations of suicide from within, but 
against modernity. We emphasize the hidden racism and capitalism of suicide 
embedded within the persuasive Eurocentric promises of the Anglo scientific 
method and the U.S. American Dream. We address the concepts of epistemicide, 
coloniality of knowledge and of being. It is our hope to contribute to further 
advance decolonizing possibilities to reinscribe options that would border with 
the current Western knowledge on suicide. This may require other configurations 
of the body, knowledge, hence ways of being, doing, thinking, sensing, feeling, 
imagining, and dreaming to coexist among pluriversal hospitable worlds of life 
and death.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the implementation of national 
lung cancer (LC) screening programme (SP) in a high-risk population from the 
perspective of the Spanish National Health System (NHS).
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis for a LC SP was carried out on a lifetime 
horizon. A Markov model was designed that assumed two scenarios, one with the 
implementation of the SP and another one without it. Effectiveness and cost of 
LC management, diagnosis and screening were included in the different health 
states. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
evaluate its robustness. A discount rate was set at 3% both for effectiveness 
and cost.
RESULTS: In the base-case, an increase of 4.80 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) per patient was obtained, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of €2345/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed the national LC 
SP to be cost-effective in 80% of cases (probability=0.8) for a 
willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to the gross domestic product per capita 
in Spain, which was set at €25 854/QALY in 2018 based on the per capita income 
of Spain. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the obtained results are 
robust in terms of changes in the presentation rates and costs, and the 
cost-effectiveness thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that the implementation of a LC SP in the 
high-risk Spanish population would be a cost-effective strategy for the Spanish 
NHS.

BACKGROUND: The benefit of surveillance colonoscopy in older adults is not well 
described.
AIMS: To quantify the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced polyps 
during surveillance colonoscopy in older adults with a history of colon polyps.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of 
Science, and Embase) for all published studies through May 2020 in adults 
age > 70 undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. The main outcome was CRC and 
advanced polyps detection. We performed meta-analysis to pool results by age 
(>70 vs. 50-70).
RESULTS: The search identified 6239 studies, of which 569 underwent full-text 
review and 64 data abstraction, of which 19 were included. The risk of detecting 
CRC (N = 11) was higher in those >70 compared to 50-70 (risk ratio 1.5 (95% CI 
1.1-2.2); risk difference 0.8% (95% CI -0.2%-1.8%)). Similarly, the risk of 
detecting advanced polyps (N = 8) was higher in those >70 compared to 50-70 
(risk ratio 1.3 (95% CI 1.2-1.3), risk difference 2.7% (95% CI 1.3%-4.0%)). Most 
studies did not stratify results by baseline polyp risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The detection of CRC and advanced polyps during surveillance 
colonoscopy in older individuals was higher than in younger controls; however, 
the absolute risk increase for both was small. These differences must be weighed 
against competing medical problems and limited life expectancy in older adults 
when making decisions about surveillance colonoscopy. More primary data on the 
risks of CRC and advanced polyps accounting for number of past colonoscopies, 
prior polyp risk, and duration of time since last polyp are needed.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is a major inflammatory disorder and causes 
substantial disability. Treatment goals span minimising disease activity, 
achieving remission and decreasing disability. In active rheumatoid arthritis, 
intensive management achieves these goals. As many patients with established 
rheumatoid arthritis have moderate disease activity, the TITRATE (Treatment 
Intensities and Targets in Rheumatoid Arthritis ThErapy) programme assessed the 
benefits of intensive management.
OBJECTIVES: To (1) define how to deliver intensive therapy in moderate 
established rheumatoid arthritis; (2) establish its clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness in a trial; and (3) evaluate evidence supporting intensive 
management in observational studies and completed trials.
DESIGN: Observational studies, secondary analyses of completed trials and 
systematic reviews assessed existing evidence about intensive management. 
Qualitative research, patient workshops and systematic reviews defined how to 
deliver it. The trial assessed its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness 
in moderate established rheumatoid arthritis.
SETTING: Observational studies (in three London centres) involved 3167 patients. 
These were supplemented by secondary analyses of three previously completed 
trials (in centres across all English regions), involving 668 patients. 
Qualitative studies assessed expectations (nine patients in four London centres) 
and experiences of intensive management (15 patients in 10 centres across 
England). The main clinical trial enrolled 335 patients with diverse 
socioeconomic deprivation and ethnicity (in 39 centres across all English 
regions).
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with established moderately active rheumatoid arthritis 
receiving conventional disease-modifying drugs.
INTERVENTIONS: Intensive management used combinations of conventional 
disease-modifying drugs, biologics (particularly tumour necrosis factor 
inhibitors) and depot steroid injections; nurses saw patients monthly, adjusted 
treatment and provided supportive person-centred psychoeducation. Control 
patients received standard care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease Activity Score for 28 joints based on the 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR)-categorised patients (active to 
remission). Remission (DAS28-ESR < 2.60) was the treatment target. Other 
outcomes included fatigue (measured on a 100-mm visual analogue scale), 
disability (as measured on the Health Assessment Questionnaire), harms and 
resource use for economic assessments.
RESULTS: Evaluation of existing evidence for intensive rheumatoid arthritis 
management showed the following. First, in observational studies, DAS28-ESR 
scores decreased over 10–20 years, whereas remissions and treatment intensities 
increased. Second, in systematic reviews of published trials, all intensive 
management strategies increased remissions. Finally, patients with high 
disability scores had fewer remissions. Qualitative studies of rheumatoid 
arthritis patients, workshops and systematic reviews helped develop an intensive 
management pathway. A 2-day training session for rheumatology practitioners 
explained its use, including motivational interviewing techniques and patient 
handbooks. The trial screened 459 patients and randomised 335 patients (168 
patients received intensive management and 167 patients received standard care). 
A total of 303 patients provided 12-month outcome data. Intention-to-treat 
analysis showed intensive management increased DAS28-ESR 12-month remissions, 
compared with standard care (32% vs. 18%, odds ratio 2.17, 95% confidence 
interval 1.28 to 3.68; p = 0.004), and reduced fatigue [mean difference –18, 95% 
confidence interval –24 to –11 (scale 0–100); p < 0.001]. Disability (as 
measured on the Health Assessment Questionnaire) decreased when intensive 
management patients achieved remission (difference –0.40, 95% confidence 
interval –0.57 to –0.22) and these differences were considered clinically 
relevant. However, in all intensive management patients reductions in the Health 
Assessment Questionnaire scores were less marked (difference –0.1, 95% 
confidence interval –0.2 to 0.0). The numbers of serious adverse events 
(intensive management n = 15 vs. standard care n = 11) and other adverse events 
(intensive management n = 114 vs. standard care n = 151) were similar. Economic 
analysis showed that the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
£43,972 from NHS and Personal Social Services cost perspectives. The probability 
of meeting a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000 was 17%. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio decreased to £29,363 after including patients’ personal 
costs and lost working time, corresponding to a 50% probability that intensive 
management is cost-effective at English willingness-to-pay thresholds. Analysing 
trial baseline predictors showed that remission predictors comprised baseline 
DAS28-ESR, disability scores and body mass index. A 6-month extension study 
(involving 95 intensive management patients) showed fewer remissions by 18 
months, although more sustained remissions were more likley to persist. 
Qualitative research in trial completers showed that intensive management was 
acceptable and treatment support from specialist nurses was beneficial.
LIMITATIONS: The main limitations comprised (1) using single time point 
remissions rather than sustained responses, (2) uncertainty about benefits of 
different aspects of intensive management and differences in its delivery across 
centres, (3) doubts about optimal treatment of patients unresponsive to 
intensive management and (4) the lack of formal international definitions of 
‘intensive management’.
CONCLUSION: The benefits of intensive management need to be set against its 
additional costs. These were relatively high. Not all patients benefited. 
Patients with high pretreatment physical disability or who were substantially 
overweight usually did not achieve remission.
FUTURE WORK: Further research should (1) identify the most effective components 
of the intervention, (2) consider its most cost-effective delivery and (3) 
identify alternative strategies for patients not responding to intensive 
management.

This research programme showed 12 months’ intensive management increased 
remissions and was acceptable to patients without increasing adverse events, 
although not all patients benefitted.

Vps13 family proteins are proposed to function in bulk lipid transfer between 
membranes, but little is known about their regulation. During sporulation of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Vps13 localizes to the prospore membrane (PSM) via the 
Spo71-Spo73 adaptor complex. We previously reported that loss of any of these 
proteins causes PSM extension and subsequent sporulation defects, yet their 
precise function remains unclear. Here, we performed a genetic screen and 
identified genes coding for a fragment of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase 
catalytic subunit and PI 4-kinase noncatalytic subunit as multicopy suppressors 
of spo73Δ. Further genetic and cytological analyses revealed that lowering PI4P 
levels in the PSM rescues the spo73Δ defects. Furthermore, overexpression of 
VPS13 and lowering PI4P levels synergistically rescued the defect of a spo71Δ 
spo73Δ double mutant, suggesting that PI4P might regulate Vps13 function. In 
addition, we show that an N-terminal fragment of Vps13 has affinity for the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and ER-plasma membrane (PM) tethers localize along 
the PSM in a manner dependent on Vps13 and the adaptor complex. These 
observations suggest that Vps13 and the adaptor complex recruit ER-PM tethers to 
ER-PSM contact sites. Our analysis revealed that involvement of a 
phosphoinositide, PI4P, in regulation of Vps13, and also suggest that distinct 
contact site proteins function cooperatively to promote de novo membrane 
formation.

OBJECTIVE: Post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading direct cause of maternal 
mortality in India. Uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) is recommended for atonic 
PPH cases not responding to uterotonics. This study assessed cost-effectiveness 
of three UBT devices used in Indian public health settings.
METHODS: A decision tree model was built to assess cost-effectiveness of 
Bakri-UBT and low-cost ESM-UBT alternatives as compared to the recommended 
standard of care i.e. condom-UBT intervention. A hypothetical annual cohort of 
women eligible for UBT intervention after experiencing atonic PPH in Indian 
public health facilities were evaluated for associated costs and outcomes over 
life-time horizon using a disaggregated societal perspective. Costs by 
undertaking primary costing and clinical parameters from published literature 
were used. Incremental cost per Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) averted, 
number of surgeries and maternal deaths with the interventions were estimated. 
An India specific willingness to pay threshold of INR 24,211 (USD 375) was used 
to evaluate cost-effectiveness. Detailed sensitivity analysis and expected value 
of information analysis was undertaken.
RESULTS: ESM-UBT at base-case Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of INR 
-2,412 (USD 37) per DALY averted is a cost-saving intervention i.e. is less 
expensive and more effective as compared to condom-UBT. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis however shows an error probability of 0.36, indicating a 
degree of uncertainty around model results. Bakri-UBT at an ICER value of INR 
-126,219 (USD -1,957) per DALY averted incurs higher incremental societal costs 
and is less effective as compared to condom-UBT. Hence, Bakri-UBT is not 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: For atonic PPH management in India, condom-UBT offers better value 
as compared to Bakri-UBT. Given the limited clinical effectiveness evidence and 
uncertainty in sensitivity analysis, cost-saving result for ESM-UBT must be 
considered with caution. Future research may focus on generating high quality 
comparative clinical evidence for UBT devices to facilitate policy decision 
making.

Cognitive Failures and the Role of Emotion in Dimensional Schizotypy: A 
Replication and Extension.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive failures are commonplace within the general population 
but may be particularly heightened in those with higher levels of schizotypy. 
This is especially salient in the context of enduring trait and momentary state 
negative emotion which often contributes to increases in daily impairments, 
leading to a more debilitating and distracted life. Particularly, individuals 
with elevated levels of schizotypy may be more likely to experience cognitive 
failures, especially in the presence of negative trait emotion such as 
depression, anxiety, and stress. However, little is known about the influence of 
state emotion and the distinct roles that state and trait emotion may have with 
cognitive failures and schizotypy.
METHODS: To replicate and extend previous findings, 306 (58% males) 
undergraduate students aged 18-50 years (M = 19.343; SD = 2.493) completed 
self-report measures of cognitive failures, trait and state emotion, and 
schizotypy. Mediation and moderation analyses were performed in SPSS to examine 
the potential effects of trait and state emotion on the relationship between 
schizotypy and cognitive failures.
RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings, mood symptomology, in addition to 
negative affect, mediated cognitive failures in those with higher levels of 
schizotypy. However, in our sample, positive affect did not appear to buffer 
against cognitive failures.
CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggest there may be a nuanced 
relationship between both negative trait and state emotions on the relationships 
between cognitive failures and schizotypy. Understanding the interaction of 
enduring versus momentary emotion on cognition as they relate to an elevated 
risk for developing schizophrenia-spectrum phenomena may be a point for earlier 
and more targeted interventions.

Opioid Use and Its Relationship to Cardiovascular Disease and Brain Health: A 
Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association.

Chow SL, Sasson C, Benjamin IJ, Califf RM, Compton WM, Oliva EM, Robson C, 
Sanchez EJ.

The misuse of opioids continues to be epidemic, resulting in dependency and a 
recent upsurge in drug overdoses that have contributed to a significant decrease 
in life expectancy in the United States. Moreover, recent data suggest that 
commonly used opioids for the management of pain may produce undesirable 
pharmacological actions and interfere with critical medications commonly used in 
cardiovascular disease and stroke; however, the impact on outcomes remains 
controversial. The American Heart Association developed an advisory statement 
for health care professionals and researchers in the setting of cardiovascular 
and brain health to synthesize the current literature, to provide approaches for 
identifying patients with opioid use disorder, and to address pain management 
and overdose. A literature and internet search spanning from January 1, 2012, to 
February 15, 2021, and limited to epidemiology studies, reviews, consensus 
statements, and guidelines in human subjects was conducted. Suggestions and 
considerations listed in this document are based primarily on published evidence 
from this review whenever possible, as well as expert opinion. Several federal 
and institutional consensus documents and clinical resources are currently 
available to both patients and clinicians; however, none have specifically 
addressed cardiovascular disease and brain health. Although strategic tools and 
therapeutic approaches for recognition of opioid use disorder and safe opioid 
use are available for health care professionals who manage patients with 
cardiovascular disease and stroke, high-quality evidence does not currently 
exist. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more research to identify the most 
effective approaches to improve care for these patients.

INTRODUCTION: The gradual changes over the decades in the longevity and ageing 
of European society as a whole can be directly related to the prolonged decline 
in the birth rate and increase in the life expectancy. According to the WHO, 
there is an increased risk of dementia or other cognitive disorders as the 
population ages, which have a major impact on public health. Mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) is described as a greater than expected cognitive decline for 
an individual's age and level of education, but that does not significantly 
interfere with activities of daily living. Patients with MCI exhibit a higher 
risk of dementia compared with others in the same age group, but without a 
cognitive decline, have impaired walking and a 50% greater risk of falling.The 
urban lifestyle and advent of smartphones, mobility and immediate access to all 
information via the internet, including health information, has led to a totally 
disruptive change in most general aspects.This systematic review protocol is 
aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of technology-based interventions in the 
detection, prevention, monitoring and treatment of patients at risk or diagnosed 
with MCI.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review protocol follows the recommendations of the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 
reporting guidelines. The search will be performed on MEDLINE (PubMed), CENTRAL, 
CINAHL Plus, ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases from 2010 to 2020. Studies 
of interventions either randomised clinical trials or pre-post non-randomised 
quasi-experimental designs, published in English and Spanish will be included. 
Articles that provide relevant information on the use of technology and its 
effectiveness in interventions that assess improvements in early detection, 
prevention, follow-up and treatment of the patients at risk or diagnosed with 
MCI will be included.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics committee approval not required. The results 
will be disseminated in publications and congresses.

OBJECTIVES: From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical practice and 
research globally have centred on the prevention of transmission and treatment 
of the disease. The pandemic has had a huge impact on the economy and stressed 
healthcare systems worldwide. The present study estimates disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), years of potential productive life lost (YPPLL) and cost of 
productivity lost (CPL) due to premature mortality and absenteeism secondary to 
COVID-19 in the state of Kerala, India.
SETTING: Details on sociodemographics, incidence, death, quarantine, recovery 
time, etc were derived from public sources and the Collective for Open Data 
Distribution-Keralam. The working proportion for 5-year age-gender cohorts and 
the corresponding life expectancy were obtained from the 2011 Census of India.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The impact of the disease was computed 
through model-based analysis on various age-gender cohorts. Sensitivity analysis 
was conducted by adjusting six variables across 21 scenarios. We present two 
estimates, one until 15 November 2020 and later updated to 10 June 2021.
RESULTS: Severity of infection and mortality were higher among the older 
cohorts, with men being more susceptible than women in most subgroups. DALYs for 
males and females were 15 954.5 and 8638.4 until 15 November 2020, and 83 853.0 
and 56 628.3 until 10 June 2021. The corresponding YPPLL were 1323.57 and 612.31 
until 15 November 2020, and 6993.04 and 3811.57 until 10 June 2021, and the CPL 
(premature mortality) were 263 780 579.94 and 41 836 001.82 until 15 November 
2020, and 1 419 557 903.76 and 278 275 495.29 until 10 June 2021.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the COVID-19 burden was contributed by years of life lost. 
Losses due to YPPLL were reduced as the impact of COVID-19 infection was lesser 
among the productive cohorts. The CPL values for individuals aged 40-49 years 
old were the highest. These estimates provide the data necessary for 
policymakers to work on reducing the economic burden of COVID-19 in Kerala.

Evaluation of the Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of the Dexcom G6 Continuous 
Glucose Monitor versus Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose in People with Type 1 
Diabetes in Canada.

BACKGROUND: The Dexcom G6 real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) 
system is one of the most sophisticated RT-CGM systems developed to date and 
became available in Canada in 2019. A health economic analysis was performed to 
determine the long-term cost-effectiveness of the Dexcom G6 RT-CGM system versus 
SMBG in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Canada.
METHODS: The analysis was performed using the IQVIA Core Diabetes Model. Based 
on clinical trial data, patients with mean baseline HbA1c of 8.6% were assumed 
to have a HbA1c reduction of 1.0% with RT-CGM versus 0.4% reduction with SMBG. 
RT-CGM was also associated with a quality of life (QoL) benefit owing to reduced 
incidence of hypoglycemia, reduced fear of hypoglycemia (FoH) and elimination of 
fingerstick testing. Direct medical costs were sourced from published 
literature, and inflated to 2019 Canadian dollars (CAD).
RESULTS: Dexcom G6 RT-CGM was projected to improve mean quality-adjusted life 
expectancy by 2.09 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to SMBG (15.52 
versus 13.43 QALYs) but mean total lifetime cots were CAD 35,353 higher with 
RT-CGM (CAD 227,357 versus CAD 192,004) resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CAD 16,931 per QALY gained. Sensitivity 
analyses revealed that assumptions relating to the QoL benefit associated with 
reduced FoH and the elimination of fingerstick testing with RT-CGM as well as 
SMBG usage and change in HbA1c were the key drivers of cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: For adults with T1D in Canada, RT-CGM is associated with improved 
glycemic control and QoL benefits owing to a reduced FoH and elimination of the 
requirement for fingerstick testing and over a lifetime time horizon is 
cost-effective relative to SMBG.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder caused by 
pathogenic variants in the gene coding for the extracellular matrix protein 
fibrillin-1. While the disease affects multiple organ systems, the most
