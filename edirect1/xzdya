PURPOSE: The Scottish Diabetes Research Network (SDRN)-diabetes research 
platform was established to combine disparate electronic health record data into 
research-ready linked datasets for diabetes research in Scotland. The resultant 
cohort, 'The SDRN-National Diabetes Dataset (SDRN-NDS)', has many uses, for 
example, understanding healthcare burden and socioeconomic trends in disease 
incidence and prevalence, observational pharmacoepidemiology studies and 
building prediction tools to support clinical decision making.
PARTICIPANTS: We estimate that >99% of those diagnosed with diabetes nationwide 
are captured into the research platform. Between 2006 and mid-2020, the cohort 
comprised 472 648 people alive with diabetes at any point in whom there were 
4 million person-years of follow-up. Of the cohort, 88.1% had type 2 diabetes, 
8.8% type 1 diabetes and 3.1% had other types (eg, secondary diabetes). Data are 
captured from all key clinical encounters for diabetes-related care, including 
diabetes clinic, primary care and podiatry and comprise clinical history and 
measurements with linkage to blood results, microbiology, prescribed and 
dispensed drug and devices, retinopathy screening, outpatient, day case and 
inpatient episodes, birth outcomes, cancer registry, renal registry and causes 
of death.
FINDINGS TO DATE: There have been >50 publications using the SDRN-NDS. Examples 
of recent key findings include analysis of the incidence and relative risks for 
COVID-19 infection, drug safety of insulin glargine and SGLT2 inhibitors, life 
expectancy estimates, evaluation of the impact of flash monitors on glycaemic 
control and diabetic ketoacidosis and time trend analysis showing that diabetic 
ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a major cause of death under age 50 years. The 
findings have been used to guide national diabetes strategy and influence 
national and international guidelines.
FUTURE PLANS: The comprehensive SDRN-NDS will continue to be used in future 
studies of diabetes epidemiology in the Scottish population. It will continue to 
be updated at least annually, with new data sources linked as they become 
available.

BACKGROUND: Different ice treatments were applied for the preservation of 
mackerel (Pneumatophorus japonicus). The quality changes of samples treated with 
flake ice (Control), slurry ice (SI) and slightly acidic electrolyzed 
water-slurry ice (SAEW-SI) in microbiological, physicochemical, protein 
characteristic, and sensory evaluation were investigated during chilled storage.
RESULTS: SAEW-SI showed a significant advantage for the inhibition of microbial 
growth, which could extend the shelf-life for another 144 h at least, compared 
with Control group. SAEW-SI treatment also showed a strong inhibition for the 
increase in pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), K-value, histamine and 
metmyoglobin (MetMb) content. Results of texture profile analysis (TPA) and 
water holding capacity (WHC) indicated that SAEW-SI can obviously suppress the 
decrease of hardness value, and have a better protective effect on muscle 
structure compared to flake ice and SI (P < 0.05). During the whole experiment, 
the highest sensory scores and a* were obtained in the SAEW-SI group, which 
indicated that SAEW-SI treatment could maintain better sensory characteristics. 
According to the results of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 
fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, SAEW-SI treatment could effectively retard 
protein degradation and lipid oxidation compared with Control and SI group. In 
maintaining the quality of mackerel, SAEW-SI shows a better effect than SI due 
to the synergistic effect of fence factors.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the shelf-life of mackerel could be 
extended and the quality of mackerel could be maintained effectively with 
SAEW-SI treatment during chilled storage. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

Viscum album L. is a plant of great importance due to its influence on the host 
trees and, by extension, entire ecosystems. The species is also significant to 
humans-on the one hand, because of its use in medicine, and on the other, 
because of the growing threat it poses to the stability of conifer stands. 
Therefore, it is important to recognize the future range of three mistletoe 
subspecies (Viscum album subsp. album, V. album subsp. austriacum, and V. album 
subsp. abietis). Modelling of the potential range of these subspecies was 
performed using MAXENT software. Locations were collected from literature and 
databases. A total number of 3335 stands were used. Bioclimatic data for the 
current conditions and three future scenarios (SSP 1.26, SSP 3.70, SSP 5.85) 
were downloaded from the CHELSA database. The results confirmed that the 
temperature is the key variable on the potential range of the analysed 
subspecies. V. album subsp. abietis is withdrawing from its range according to 
all scenarios. In the case of V. album subsp. austriacum, a slight range shift 
is visible. Only the V. album subsp. album will expand non-directionally. The 
reason is most likely a very large number of host species and greater genetic 
variability compared to the subspecies found on conifers.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity in pregnancy has been associated with increased 
childhood cardiometabolic risk and reduced life expectancy. The UK UPBEAT 
multicentre randomised control trial was a lifestyle intervention of diet and 
physical activity in pregnant women with obesity. We hypothesised that the 
3-year-old children of women with obesity would have heightened cardiovascular 
risk compared to children of normal BMI women, and that the UPBEAT intervention 
would mitigate this risk.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Children were recruited from one UPBEAT trial centre. 
Cardiovascular measures included blood pressure, echocardiographic assessment of 
cardiac function and dimensions, carotid intima-media thickness and heart rate 
variability (HRV) by electrocardiogram.
RESULTS: Compared to offspring of normal BMI women (n = 51), children of women 
with obesity from the trial standard care arm (n = 39) had evidence of cardiac 
remodelling including increased interventricular septum (IVS; mean difference 
0.04 cm; 95% CI: 0.018 to 0.067), posterior wall (PW; 0.03 cm; 0.006 to 0.062) 
and relative wall thicknesses (RWT; 0.03 cm; 0.01 to 0.05) following adjustment. 
Randomisation of women with obesity to the intervention arm (n = 31) prevented 
this cardiac remodelling (intervention effect; mean difference IVS -0.03 cm 
(-0.05 to -0.008); PW -0.03 cm (-0.05 to -0.01); RWT -0.02 cm (-0.04 to 
-0.005)). Children of women with obesity (standard care arm) compared to women 
of normal BMI also had elevated minimum heart rate (7 bpm; 1.41 to 13.34) 
evidence of early diastolic dysfunction (e prime) and increased sympathetic 
nerve activity index by HRV analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity was associated with left ventricular concentric 
remodelling in 3-year-old offspring. Absence of remodelling following the 
maternal intervention infers in utero origins of cardiac remodelling.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME AND REGISTRATION NUMBER: The UPBEAT trial is 
registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN89971375.

BACKGROUND: This study aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 3 which borders 
on "good health and well-being for people by ensuring healthy lives and 
promoting well-being for all at all ages". It contributes to the health 
literature by evaluating the roles of health expenditures and educational 
quality on three health outcomes (infant mortality, maternal mortality and life 
expectancy at birth).
METHODS: The study uses the panel spatial correlation consistent (PSCC) approach 
on balanced panel data on 25 selected sub-Saharan African countries from 2000 to 
2020 to interrogate the nexus.
RESULTS: The following findings are documented. First, health expenditures 
reveal significant asymmetric quadratic effects on health outcomes. Second, the 
interactions between health expenditures and educational quality reduce infant 
and maternal mortalities while enhancing life expectancy. Third, the threshold 
points from the interaction effects indicate that enhancing educational quality 
beyond some critical thresholds of 1.51 and 1.49 can induce a drop in maternal 
and child mortalities while a point beyond 1.84 exerts an improvement in life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Hence, policy makers should ensure that both health expenditures 
and educational quality exceed the established thresholds for sustainable health 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Investment in primary health care (PHC) to achieve universal health 
coverage (UHC) and better health outcomes remains a key global health agenda. 
This study aimed to assess the effects of PHC spending on UHC and health 
outcomes.
METHODS: The study used the Grossman Health Production Model and conducted 
econometric analyses using panel data from 2016 to 2019 covering 34 countries in 
SSA. Fixed and random effects panel regression models were used for the 
analyses. All the analyses in this study were carried out using the statistical 
software package STATA Version 15.
RESULTS: We found that PHC expenditure has a positive significant but inelastic 
effect on UHC and life expectancy at birth and a negative effect on infant 
mortality. Both the fixed and random effects models provided a robust 
relationship between PHC expenditure and UHC and health outcomes. Education, 
access to an improved water source, and the age structure of the population were 
found to be strongly associated with health outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The inelastic nature of the PHC expenditure means that the UHC goal 
might only be achieved at high levels of PHC expenditure. This implies that 
policymakers must make conscious effort to increase PHC expenditure to ensure 
the attainment of the UHC goal.

Donkeys' gut microbe is critical for their health and adaptation to the 
environment. Little research has been conducted on the donkey gut microbiome 
compared with other domestic animals. The Tibetan Plateau is an extreme 
environment. In this study, 6 Qinghai donkeys (QH) from the Tibetan Plateau and 
6 Dezhou donkeys (DZ) were investigated, and the contents of 4 parts-stomach, 
small intestine, cecum, and rectum-were collected. 16S rRNA sequencing and 
metagenomic sequencing were used to analyze the composition and diversity of gut 
microbial communities in donkeys. The results showed that the flora diversity 
and richness of the hindgut were significantly higher than those of the foregut 
(p < 0.01), with no sex differences, and the community structure and composition 
of the same or adjacent regions (stomach, small intestine, cecum, and rectum) 
were similar. Besides, the flora diversity and richness of QH on the Tibetan 
Plateau were significantly higher than those of DZ (p < 0.05). The major 
pathways associated with QH were signal transduction mechanisms and carbohydrate 
transport and metabolism, and Bacteroidales were the major contributors to these 
functions. Our study provides novel insights into the contribution of 
microbiomes to the adaptive evolution of donkeys.

Quantitative measuring the population-level diversity-scaling of human 
microbiomes is different from conventional approach to traditional 
individual-level diversity analysis, and it is of obvious significance. For 
example, it is well known that individuals are of significant heterogeneity with 
their microbiome diversities, and the population-level analysis can effectively 
capture such kind of individual differences. Here we reanalyze a dozen datasets 
of 2,115 human breast milk microbiome (BMM) samples with diversity-area 
relationship (DAR) to tackle the previous questions. Our focus on BMM is aimed 
to offer insights for supplementing the gut microbiome research from nutritional 
perspective. DAR is an extension to classic species-area relationship, which was 
discovered in the 19th century and established as one of a handful fundamental 
laws in community ecology. Our DAR modeling revealed the following numbers, all 
approximately: (i) The population-level potential diversity of BMM is 1,108 in 
terms of species richness (number of total species), and 67 in terms of typical 
species. (ii) On average, an individual carry 17% of population-level diversity 
in terms of species richness, and 61% in terms of typical species. (iii) The 
similarity (overlap) between individuals according to pair-wise diversity 
overlap (PDO) should be approximately 76% in terms of total species, and 92% in 
terms of typical species, which symbolizes the inter-individual heterogeneity. 
(iv) The average individual (alpha-) diversity of BMM is approximately 188 
(total-species) and 37 (typical-species). (v) To deal with the potential 
difference among 12 BMM datasets, we conducted DAR modeling separately for each 
dataset, and then performed permutation tests for DAR parameters. It was found 
that the DAR scaling parameter that measures inter-individual heterogeneity in 
diversity is invariant (constant), but the population potential diversity is 
different among 30% of the pair-wise comparison between 12 BMM datasets. These 
results offer comprehensive biodiversity analyses of the BMM from host 
individual, inter-individual, and population level perspectives.

Immunodeficiency Virus.

Introduction Significant advancements in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
treatment have led to an increasing life expectancy among patients living with 
HIV (PLWH). Given this rise in life expectancy, as well as the ability to lead a 
more active lifestyle, the rate of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in this 
population is increasing. Unfortunately, the current medical literature 
surrounding the safety and efficacy of TJA in this patient population is 
indeterminant. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if 
optimization of PLWH prior to TJA would result in any changes in the 
incidence of postoperative complications and hospital length of stay (LOS) when 
compared to historically reported data.  Materials and methods A retrospective 
study was performed of all PLWH 18 years and older who underwent either a 
primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA) between 
2009 and 2019 at our academic institution. Medical records were reviewed for 
each patient to assess demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory 
studies, operative details, length of hospital stay, complications, and 
follow-up time. Patients were optimized using our institution's current 
optimization guidelines: body mass index (BMI) less than 40 kg/m2, hemoglobin 
>12 g/dL, no tobacco use within 30 days of surgery, albumin >3.5 g/dL. 
Independent-sample t-tests and Pearson's chi-square tests were used to evaluate 
the continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Results This study 
included 47 TJA in PLWH, including 14 TKA and 33 THA. Out of the 47 patients, 13 
(27.7%) were fully optimized for all four variables: BMI, hemoglobin, 
non-smoking status, and albumin. There was no significant difference between the 
group of PLWH that was completely optimized and the group that was not in any 
patient characteristics, preoperative labs, intraoperative variables, or 
postoperative variables, including length of hospital stay and complications. A 
larger proportion of patients not completely optimized was found to be active 
smokers (p=0.0003). All complications occurred in cases in which the patients 
were not fully optimized. Subgroup analysis of PLWH, who were completely 
optimized, showed an average LOS of 4.3+/-1.5 days following TKA and 2.9+/-1.1 
days following THA. Subgroup analysis of PLWH not completely optimized showed 
that each case was optimized for at least one variable and that those optimized 
for albumin had the largest (12.2%) number of complications. Conclusion PLWH can 
achieve a low rate of complications and LOS similar to that of the general 
population if medically and nutritionally optimized. Additional research is 
necessary to reveal well-defined parameters for achieving a higher rate of 
optimization prior to surgery in this important patient population.

An increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels alleviates 
age-related disease progression and promotes healthy life expectancy. Several 
studies have demonstrated that NAD+ levels can be efficiently replenished via 
nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) intake; additionally, the safety of its oral 
ingestion has been confirmed in recent clinical trials. However, the efficacy 
and safety of intravenous NMN administration in humans remain unclear. 
Therefore, we verified its safety in 10 healthy volunteers. Intravenous 
administration of NMN did not affect electrocardiograms, pulse, and blood 
pressure, nor did it affect metabolic markers in the liver, heart, pancreas, and 
kidneys. These results indicate that intravenous NMN administration is safe and 
beneficial in humans. Furthermore, NMN administration significantly increased 
blood NAD+ levels without damaging blood cells and significantly reduced blood 
triglyceride (TG) levels. These findings imply that intravenous administration 
of NMN may lead to the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with 
increased TG levels, such as fatty liver and diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Over the past four decades, advances in HIV treatment have 
contributed to a longer life expectancy for people living with HIV (PLWH). With 
these gains, the prevention and management of chronic co-morbidities, such as 
diabetes, are now central medical care goals for this population. In the United 
States, food insecurity disproportionately impacts PLWH and may play a role in 
the development of insulin resistance through direct and indirect pathways. The 
Nutrition to Optimize, Understand, and Restore Insulin Sensitivity in HIV for 
Oklahoma (NOURISH-OK) will use a novel, multi-level, integrated framework to 
explore how food insecurity contributes to insulin resistance among PLWH. 
Specifically, it will explore how food insecurity may operate as an intermediary 
risk factor for insulin resistance, including potential linkages between 
upstream determinants of health and downstream consequences of poor diet, other 
behavioral risk factors, and chronic inflammation.
METHODS/DESIGN: This paper summarizes the protocol for the first aim of the 
NOURISH-OK study, which involves purposeful cross-sectional sampling of PLWH 
(n=500) across four levels of food insecurity to test our conceptual framework. 
Developed in collaboration with community stakeholders, this initial phase 
involves the collection of anthropometrics, fasting blood samples, non-blood 
biomarkers, 24-hour food recall to estimate the Dietary Inflammatory Index 
(DII®) score, and survey data. A 1-month, prospective observational sub-study 
(total n=100; n=25 for each food security group) involves weekly 24-hour food 
recalls and stool samples to identify temporal associations between food 
insecurity, diet, and gut microbiome composition. Using structural equation 
modeling, we will explore how upstream risk factors, including early life 
events, current discrimination, and community food access, may influence food 
insecurity and its potential downstream impacts, including diet, other lifestyle 
risk behaviors, and chronic inflammation, with insulin resistance as the 
ultimate outcome variable. Findings from these analyses of observational data 
will inform the subsequent study aims, which involve qualitative exploration of 
significant pathways, followed by development and testing of a low-DII® food as 
medicine intervention to reverse insulin resistance among PLWH 
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05208671).
DISCUSSION: The NOURISH-OK study will address important research gaps to inform 
the development of food as medicine interventions to support healthy aging for 
PLWH.

Facilitating bias in cost-effectiveness analysis: CHEERS 2022 and the creation 
of assumption-driven imaginary value claims in health technology assessment.

Langley P(1).

MN, 55455, USA.

The current standards for health technology cost-effectiveness assessment rest 
on the creation of lifetime assumption-driven modeled simulations for imaginary 
pricing and consequent patient access recommendations. A recent BMJ paper 
reports a detailed assessment of 8,192 cost-effectiveness analyses, concluding 
that industry-sponsored modeled claims were more likely to publish incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below a USD 50,000 threshold than non-industry 
sponsored studies, supporting the claim that the product was cost-effective. 
This is unsurprising; indeed, the opposite can occur with a modeled claim 
deliberately resulting in ICER is excess of USD 50,000. This methodology is well 
entrenched with the recently published Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation 
Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 guidance for creating imaginary 
cost-effectiveness modeled claims ensuring the opportunity for deliberately 
manipulated cost-effectiveness claims. This overlooks limitations imposed by 
fundamental measurement, rendering assumption-driven simulations redundant 
analytical exercises. Manipulation of ICERs and claims for cost-effectiveness 
are mathematically impossible; including cost-utility thresholds, because the 
preference or utilities supporting creation of quality-of-life years (QALYs) are 
ordinal scores. Nevertheless, with the promotion of CHEERS 2022, the belief in 
imaginary modeled value claims is both facilitated and reinforced. With CHEERS 
2022, there is a concerted effort, largely in self-interest, to perpetuate the 
current belief system. This is a self-defeating strategy. Rather than admitting 
to the deficiencies of assumption-driven simulated imaginary claims, leaders are 
maintaining that health system decision makers can ignore standards of normal 
science and fundamental measurement in value claims for pharmaceutical products. 
This disregard of standards that are commonplace in the sciences and mainstream 
social sciences perpetuates the opportunity for self-serving modeled claims; 
where models are a marketing vehicle leading to sponsored systematic bias in 
formulary submissions. This supports the need for a NEW START paradigm for 
health technology assessment, focusing on evaluable single-attribute value 
claims, meeting the required standards for normal science and fundamental 
measurement.

Mango fruit exhibit high postharvest losses due to physiological, biochemical, 
and pathological deterioration during storage. Edible coatings such as 
hydrocolloids (HC) bear promising potential for fruit quality preservation at 
ambient storage due to its triple action (physiological, biochemical and 
pathological) on fruit and thus widely researched in recent years. This study 
demonstrates the influence of health and eco-safe hydrocolloid edible coatings 
such as "Carboxymethyl cellulose" (CMC) (1%), "Guar gum" (1.5%), "Gum Arabica" 
(10%), and "Xanthan gum" (0.3%) as dip treatment to enhance the postharvest 
quality and storage life of mangoes at ambient storage (25 ± 4°C and 65 ± 5% 
RH). "Xanthan gum" (0.3%) treatment exhibited the highest efficacy in reducing 
the decay loss by more than threefold and physiological loss by twofold over 
control fruit. It lowered the physiological and fruit softening enzyme 
activities (PG, PME, and LOX), while maintaining the biochemicals. Moreover, it 
maintained both internal as well as external (consumer preference) quality of 
fruit and extended 6 days shelf life on the physiological loss standard basis 
(≤10%) than that of the control. The results recommend the application of 
"Xanthan gum" (0.3%) as an efficacious ecological, sustainable, and 
health-friendly surface edible coating for quality preservation and storage 
period extension of mango fruit under ambient storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: 
The selected hydrocolloid edible coatings dip treatment showed promising 
potential in controlling the physiological, biochemical, and pathological 
deterioration of mango fruit stored under ambient condition. The selected 
treatments extended the shelf life without diminishing fruit quality. However, 
among the attempted HC treatments, the "Xanthan gum" (0.3%) (XG) coating 
displayed the excellent results. It added the storage life of mango fruit by 
6 days over the control. XG treated fruit displayed the excellent results in 
terms of storage period extension, quality retention, consumer preference, and 
control over the fruit decay and softening enzymes activities. Postharvest 
preservation of mango fruit using HC is nonchemical, cost-effective approach 
which is GRAS (generally recognized as safe), health, and eco safe.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an acute, 
rapidly progressing and life-threatening form of cancer involving immature 
lymphocytes called lymphoblasts. ALL is the most common subtype of leukemia in 
children and adolescents. The aim of the present study was to assess the 
cost-utility of pegaspargase versus L-asparaginase, both followed by Erwinase in 
the therapy sequence, as a treatment option for pediatric, adolescent, and adult 
patients with ALL in Greece.
METHODS: A published cost-utility model comprising a decision tree and a 
state-transition Markov model was adapted from a public payer perspective to 
compare a pegaspargase treatment sequence with an L-asparaginase sequence. 
Efficacy and safety data, as well as utility values, were extracted from the 
published literature. Direct costs pertaining to drug acquisition, 
administration, and management of hypersensitivity were considered in the 
analysis (€2020). Model-extrapolated outcomes included quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). All 
future outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were 
used to explore the impact of changing input data.
RESULTS: The analysis showed that the pegaspargase sequence was estimated to 
produce 0.05 additional QALYs (18.12 vs. 18.07) and lower cost of - €1698 
compared with L-asparaginase, indicating that the pegaspargase sequence was a 
dominant treatment strategy (improved outcomes with reduced costs) compared with 
L-asparaginase. Deterministic sensitivity analysis confirmed the cost-effective 
profile of pegaspargase. At the defined willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€54,000/QALY gained, probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that pegaspargase 
had a 100% probability of being cost effective relative to the L-asparaginase 
sequence.
CONCLUSION: The pegaspargase sequence was found to be less costly and more 
effective (in terms of QALYs) in relation to the L-asparaginase sequence, 
representing a dominant strategic option for Greek public payers in ALL.

Burden of lung cancer attributable to household air pollution in the Chinese 
female population: trend analysis from 1990 to 2019 and future predictions.

This study analyzes the long-term trend of the burden of lung cancer 
attributable to household air pollution in the Chinese female population, from 
1990 to 2019, and make predictions for the next decade. Based the data from the 
2019 Global Burden of Diseases (GBD 2019), the joinpoint regression model was 
used to reflect the temporal trend of the burden of lung cancer attributable to 
household air pollution, and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) 
model was used to predict the burden of disease over the next decade. From 1990 
to 2019, the age-standardized mortality and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) rates of the Chinese female population were higher than the global 
rates, and the gap due to residential radon increased over time. The burden of 
lung cancer attributable to solid fuels has shown a significant downward trend 
while that due to residential radon has increased slightly overall, but remains 
lower than the former. The burden of lung cancer increased with age, and the 
peak age of DALYs rates changed from 70 < 75 years in 1990 to 75 < 80 years in 
2019. The model predicted that the burden of lung cancer attributable to solid 
fuels will gradually decrease over the next decade, whereas the burden of lung 
cancer due to residential radon will gradually increase and surpass the burden 
due to solid fuels in 2023. Residential radon will become a more important 
factor of household air pollution than solid fuels in the next decade for the 
Chinese female population. Future interventions targeted at household air 
pollution are needed to reduce the burden of lung cancer.

University, Seoul, Korea.

OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed inequities in excess mortality according to 
region and socioeconomic position to explain the distribution of excess 
mortality in Korea in 2020.
METHODS: We acquired weekly all-cause mortality data from January 2015 to 
December 2020 from (1) the National Health Insurance Database and (2) Vital 
Statistics. Excess mortality for 2020 was calculated by comparing the weekly 
observed and expected deaths from the same period (2015-2019) using 
quasi-Poisson regression.
RESULTS: An inequitable distribution of excess mortality was identified. The 
estimated excess mortality in Korea was -29,112 (95% confidence interval, 
-29,832 to -28,391), corresponding to -55 per 100,000, and the ratio of observed 
deaths to expected deaths was 0.91. Negative excess mortality was observed 
except for females in the 0-14 age group. Male Medical Aid beneficiaries showed 
positive excess mortality, while non-disabled and disabled groups showed similar 
negative values. When the standardized mortality ratio was calculated for the 
top 10 causes of death, deaths from Alzheimer's disease and septicemia 
increased, whereas those from diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular disease 
decreased. The decrease in mortality was primarily concentrated in older adults, 
while the mortality of young females increased due to increased intentional 
self-harm.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds essential evidence regarding the overall 
performance of Korea. The observed inequalities according to various 
socioeconomic variables indicate that the results of strict measures to control 
coronavirus disease 2019 were not distributed equitably. Efforts should be made 
to properly evaluate the current and future problems related to the pandemic.

BACKGROUND: The innovative pharmacological combination of low-dose rivaroxaban 
plus aspirin provides clinicians with an ideal opportunity to intensify the 
medical treatment of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and comorbid 
peripheral artery disease (PAD). We aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
PAD screening using the ankle-brachial index (ABI) test in patients with CAD 
(with rivaroxaban administered if the PAD screening was positive) compared with 
no-screening strategy in China.
METHODS: A Markov decision model using a 1-month cycle was developed to simulate 
the 25-year effectiveness and cost of PAD screening on 75-year-old patients with 
CAD in China, evaluating the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to assess the impact of variations in the key parameters 
for ICERs.
RESULTS: Our model found an incremental cost of RMB4,959 (US$740) and an 
incremental QALY of 0.054 after one-time ABI screening, leading to an ICER of 
RMB91,936 (US$13,717) per QALY gained over a 25-year period. The reduction in 
all-cause mortality related to rivaroxaban and its cost were the factors most 
affecting the ICER. The screening would become cost-effective by decreasing the 
monthly cost of rivaroxaban to RMB184.5 (US$27.5) or by using domestic-brand 
rivaroxaban according to the threshold of a willingness to pay RMB72,447 
(US$10,809) per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that ABI screening for PAD to decide on 
low-dose rivaroxaban administration was not cost-effective for patients with CAD 
in China. Nevertheless, policy-guided cost changes for domestic-brand 
rivaroxaban could easily resolve this issue.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that extreme heat likely increases the 
risk of road injuries. However, the global burden of road injuries due to high 
temperature and contributing factors remain unclear. This study aims to 
characterize the global, regional and national burden of road injuries due to 
high temperature from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019, we obtained the 
numbers and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) rates (ASDR) of the road injury due to 
high temperature at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2019. The 
world is divided into five climate zones according to the average annual 
temperature of each country: tropical, subtropical, warm temperate, cold 
temperate, and boreal. We used the generalized additive models (GAM) to model 
the trends of road injuries globally and by region.
RESULTS: Globally, between 1990 and 2019, the deaths of road injury attributable 
to high temperature increased significantly from 20,270 (95% uncertainty 
interval [UI], 7836 to 42,716) to 28,396 (95% UI, 13,311 to 51,178), and the 
DALYs increased from 1,169,309 (95% UI, 450,834 to 2,491,075) to 1,414,527 (95%
