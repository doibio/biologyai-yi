3-year intervals, was cost-effective for patients with pathogenic variants in 
MSH6 or PMS2, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simulation model to select optimal surveillance 
starting ages and intervals for patients with Lynch syndrome based on MMR 
variant. The model supports recommendations for intensive surveillance of 
patients with Lynch syndrome-associated variants in MLH1 or MSH2. However, for 
patients with Lynch syndrome-associated variants of MSH6 or PMS2, later 
initiation of surveillance at 35 and 40 years, respectively, and at 3-year 
intervals, can be considered.

Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from acute and chronic pulmonary 
infections with bacterial pathogens, which often determine their life quality 
and expectancy. Previous studies have demonstrated a downregulation of the acid 
ceramidase in CF epithelial cells resulting in an increase of ceramide and a 
decrease of sphingosine. Sphingosine kills many bacterial pathogens, and the 
downregulation of sphingosine seems to determine the infection susceptibility of 
cystic fibrosis mice and patients. It is presently unknown how deficiency of the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) connects to a marked 
downregulation of the acid ceramidase in human and murine CF epithelial cells. 
Here, we employed quantitative PCR, western blot analysis, and enzyme activity 
measurements to study the role of IRF8 for acid ceramidase regulation. We report 
that genetic deficiency or functional inhibition of CFTR/Cftr results in an 
upregulation of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) and a concomitant 
downregulation of acid ceramidase expression with CF and an increase of ceramide 
and a reduction of sphingosine levels in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells 
from both human individuals or mice. CRISPR/Cas9- or siRNA-mediated 
downregulation of IRF8 prevented changes of acid ceramidase, ceramide, and 
sphingosine in CF epithelial cells and restored resistance to Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa infections, which is one of the most important and common pathogens 
in lung infection of patients with CF. These studies indicate that CFTR 
deficiency causes a downregulation of acid ceramidase via upregulation of IRF8, 
which is a central pathway to control infection susceptibility of CF cells.

A correlated lifetime prediction concept for load cases without static preload, 
which argues with crack growth and particle size distribution from 3D computer 
tomography, has been shown by Ludwig et al. (2015). This method is extended to 
non-relaxing load cases i.e. with a static preload dependency. A force 
controlled dynamic fatigue test for a dumbbell specimen is performed to 
investigate the service life. In addition, a crack growth investigation is 
carried out using single edge notched tensile (SENT) specimens in displacement 
control mode to characterize the tearing energy and crack growth rate. The study 
with carbon black reinforced HNBR rubber shows a correlation between the Wöhler 
curve and the Paris-Erdogan plot. An extension of the empirical Paris-Erdogan 
equation considering static preload dependency allows the prediction of uniaxial 
lifetime statistics by means of particle size distribution. The calculated 
lifetime values are in reasonable concordance with the experimental findings.

INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability and 
is associated with decreased survival. Although it is generally accepted that 
TBI increases risk of death in acute and postacute periods after injury, causes 
of premature death after TBI in the long term are less clear.
METHODS: A cohort sample of Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents with confirmed 
TBI from January 1987 through December 1999 was identified. Each case was 
assigned an age- and sex-matched non-TBI referent case, called regular referent. 
Confirmed TBI cases with simultaneous nonhead injuries were identified, labeled 
special cases. These were assigned 2 age- and sex-matched special referents with 
nonhead injuries of similar severity. Underlying causes of death in each case 
were categorized using death certificates, International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 
Tenth Revision, and manual health record review. Comparisons were made over the 
study period and among 6-month survivors.
RESULTS: Case-regular referent pairs (n = 1,257) were identified over the study 
period, and 221 were special cases. In total, 237 deaths occurred among these 
pairs. A statistically significant difference was observed between total number 
of deaths among all cases (n = 139, 11%) and regular referents (n = 98, 8%) (p = 
0.006) over the entire period. This outcome was not true for special cases 
(32/221, 14%) and special referents (61/441, 14%) (p = 0.81). A greater 
proportion of deaths by external cause than all other causes was observed in all 
cases (52/139, 37%) versus regular referents (3/98, 3%) and in special cases 
(13/32, 41%) versus special referents (5/61, 8%) (p < 0.001 for both). Among all 
case-referent pairs surviving 6 months, no difference was found between total 
number of deaths (p = 0.82). The underlying cause of death between these 2 
groups was significantly different for external causes only (p < 0.01). For 
special cases surviving 6 months versus special referents, no difference was 
observed in total number of deaths (p = 0.24) or underlying causes of death (p = 
1.00) between groups.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This population-based case-matched referent study showed 
that increased risk of death after TBI existed only during the first 6 months 
after injury, and the difference was due to external causes.

Cost-effectiveness of single-use negative-pressure therapy compared with 
standard care for prevention of reconstruction failure in prepectoral breast 
reconstruction.

BACKGROUND: Single-use negative-pressure wound therapy (sNPWT) has been reported 
to reduce the incidence of reconstruction failure in prepectoral breast 
reconstruction compared with standard surgical dressings. The aim of this 
economic evaluation was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of sNPWT compared 
with standard care for the prevention of reconstruction failure in prepectoral 
breast reconstruction in the UK.
METHOD: A decision tree model was used to estimate the expected cost and 
effectiveness per patient. Effectiveness was measured both by the number of 
reconstruction failures avoided and the gain in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). The baseline incidence of reconstruction failure (8.6 per cent) was 
taken from a recently published study of 2655 mastectomies in the UK. The 
effectiveness of sNPWT used results from a clinical study comparing sNPWT with 
standard dressings. Previously published utility weights were applied. The cost 
of reconstruction failure was estimated from detailed resource data from 
patients with reconstruction failure, applying National Health Service reference 
costs. One-way, probabilistic, scenario and threshold analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The undiscounted cost per patient associated with reconstruction 
failure was estimated to be £23 628 (£22 431 discounted). The use of sNPWT was 
associated with an expected cost saving of £1706 per patient, an expected 
increase in QALYs of 0.0187 and an expected 0.0834 reconstruction failures 
avoided. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analysis demonstrated that, at a 
threshold of £20 000 per QALY, 99.94 per cent of the simulations showed sNPWT to 
be more cost-effective than standard care.
CONCLUSION: Among patients undergoing immediate prepectoral breast 
reconstruction, the use of sNPWT is more cost-effective than standard dressings.

BACKGROUND: Years of Life Lost (YLLs) measure the shortfall in life expectancy 
due to a medical condition and have been used in multiple contexts. Previously 
it was estimated that there were 1.2 million YLLs associated with coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths in the USA through 11 July 2020. The aim of this 
study is to update YLL estimates for the first full year of the pandemic.
METHODS: We employed data regarding COVID-19 deaths in the USA through 31 
January 2021 by jurisdiction, gender and age group. We used actuarial life 
expectancy tables by gender and age to estimate YLLs.
RESULTS: We estimated roughly 3.9 million YLLs due to COVID-19 deaths, which 
correspond to roughly 9.2 YLLs per death. We observed a large range across 
states in YLLs per 10 000 capita, with New York City at 298 and Vermont at 12. 
Nationally, the YLLs per 10 000 capita were greater for males than females 
(136.3 versus 102.3), but there was significant variation in the differences 
across states.
CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates provide further insight into the mortality effects of 
COVID-19. The observed differences across states and genders demonstrate the 
need for disaggregated analyses of the pandemic's effects.

BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction is a major risk factor for stillbirth. A 
routine late-pregnancy ultrasound scan could help detect this, allowing 
intervention to reduce the risk of stillbirth. Such a scan could also detect 
fetal presentation and predict macrosomia. A trial powered to detect stillbirth 
differences would be extremely large and expensive.
OBJECTIVES: It is therefore critical to know whether this would be a good 
investment of public research funds. The aim of this study is to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of various late-pregnancy screening and management strategies 
based on current information and predict the return on investment from further 
research.
METHODS: Synthesis of current evidence structured into a decision model 
reporting expected costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and net benefit over 20 
years and value-of-information analysis reporting predicted return on investment 
from future clinical trials.
RESULTS: Given a willingness to pay of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained, the most cost-effective strategy is a routine presentation-only scan for 
all women. Universal ultrasound screening for fetal size is unlikely to be 
cost-effective. Research exploring the cost implications of induction of labor 
has the greatest predicted return on investment. A randomized, controlled trial 
with an endpoint of stillbirth is extremely unlikely to be a value for money 
investment.
CONCLUSION: Given current value-for-money thresholds in the United Kingdom, the 
most cost-effective strategy is to offer all pregnant women a presentation-only 
scan in late pregnancy. A randomized, controlled trial of screening and 
intervention to reduce the risk of stillbirth following universal ultrasound to 
detect macrosomia or fetal growth restriction is unlikely to represent a value 
for money investment.

OBJECTIVES: Uncontrolled hypertension is a common cause of cardiovascular 
disease, which is the deadliest and costliest chronic disease in the United 
States. Pharmacists are an accessible community healthcare resource and are 
equipped with clinical skills to improve the management of hypertension through 
medication therapy management (MTM). Nevertheless, current reimbursement models 
do not incentivize pharmacists to provide clinical services. We aim to 
investigate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-led comprehensive MTM clinic 
compared with no clinic for 10-year primary prevention of stroke and 
cardiovascular disease events in patients with hypertension.
METHODS: We built a semi-Markov model to evaluate the clinical and economic 
consequences of an MTM clinic compared with no MTM clinic, from the payer 
perspective. The model was populated with data from a recently published 
controlled observational study investigating the effectiveness of an MTM clinic. 
Methodology was guided using recommendations from the Second Panel on 
Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, including appropriate sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Compared with no MTM clinic, the MTM clinic was cost-effective with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $38 798 per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. The incremental net monetary benefit was $993 294 considering a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY. Health-benefit benchmarks at 
$100 000 per QALY and $150 000 per QALY translate to a 95% and 170% increase 
from current reimbursement rates for MTM services.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows current reimbursement rates for pharmacist-led MTM 
services may undervalue the benefit realized by US payers. New reimbursement 
models are needed to allow pharmacists to offer cost-effective clinical 
services.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the impact of using EQ5D-5L (5L) compared with EQ5D-3L 
(3L) in cost-effectiveness analyses in 6 countries with 3L and 5L values: 
Germany, Japan, Korea, The Netherlands, China, and Spain.
METHODS: Eight cost-effectiveness analyses based on clinical studies with 3L 
provided 11 pairwise comparisons. We estimated cost-effectiveness by applying 
the appropriate country values for 3L to observed responses. We re-estimated 
cost-effectiveness for each country by predicting the 5L tariff score for each 
respondent, for each country, using a previously published mapping method. We 
compared results in terms of impact on estimated incremental quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gain and cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: For most countries the impact of moving from 3L to 5L is to lower the 
incremental QALY gain in the majority of comparisons. The only exception to this 
was Japan, where 4 out of 11 cases (37%) saw lower QALYs gained when using 5L. 
The mean and median reductions in health gain, in those case studies where 5L 
does lead to lower health gain, are largest in The Netherlands (84% mean 
reduction, 41% median reduction), Germany (68% and 27%), and Spain (30% and 
31%). For most countries, those studies where 5L leads to lower health gain see 
larger reductions than the gains in studies showing the opposite tendency.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 3L and 5L are not interchangeable in these countries. 
Differences between results are large, but the direction of change can be 
unpredictable. These findings should prompt further investigation into the 
reasons for differences.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of multitarget stool DNA testing 
(MT-sDNA) compared with colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for 
Alaska Native adults.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate the 3 screening test 
effects over 40 years. Outcomes included colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and 
mortality, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The study incorporated updated evidence on 
screening test performance and adherence and was conducted from December 15, 
2016, through November 6, 2019.
RESULTS: With perfect adherence, CRC incidence was reduced by 52% (95% CI, 46% 
to 56%) using colonoscopy, 61% (95% CI, 57% to 64%) using annual FIT, and 66% 
(95% CI, 63% to 68%) using MT-sDNA. Compared with no screening, perfect 
adherence screening extends life by 0.15, 0.17, and 0.19 QALYs per person with 
colonoscopy, FIT, and MT-sDNA, respectively. Colonoscopy is the most expensive 
strategy: approximately $110 million more than MT-sDNA and $127 million more 
than FIT. With imperfect adherence (best case), MT-sDNA resulted in 0.12 QALYs 
per person vs 0.05 and 0.06 QALYs per person by FIT and colonoscopy, 
respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses supported the base-case 
analysis. Under varied adherence scenarios, MT-sDNA either dominates or is 
cost-effective (ICERs, $1740-$75,868 per QALY saved) compared with FIT and 
colonoscopy.
CONCLUSION: Each strategy reduced costs and increased QALYs compared with no 
screening. Screening by MT-sDNA results in the largest QALY savings. In Markov 
model analysis, screening by MT-sDNA in the Alaska Native population was 
cost-effective compared with screening by colonoscopy and FIT for a wide range 
of adherence scenarios.

BACKGROUND: Knee extensor muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) 
are major components of physical fitness. Because the interactive association of 
knee extensor muscle strength and CRF with bone health remains unclear, we aimed 
to investigate such association in Japanese adults.
METHODS: Altogether, 8,829 Japanese adults (3,731 men and 5,098 women) aged ≥45 
years completed the maximum voluntary knee extension test, submaximal exercise 
test, medical examination, and a questionnaire on lifestyle habits. Using an 
osteo-sono assessment index, low bone stiffness tendency was defined as 80% 
under the young-adults mean. Multivariable odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated after confounder adjustment.
RESULTS: Overall, 542 men (14.5%) and 978 women (19.2%) had low bone stiffness 
tendency. We observed an inverse association between muscle strength and low 
bone stiffness tendency after adjustment for CRF in both sexes (P for linear 
trend <0.001). Compared with the lowest CRF, the multivariable ORs for low bone 
stiffness tendency in the highest CRF were 0.47 (95% CI, 0.36-0.62) for men and 
1.05 (95% CI, 0.82-1.35) for post-menopausal women (P < 0.001 and P = 0.704, 
respectively). No interactive association between muscle strength and CRF for 
low bone stiffness tendency existed in both sexes and irrespective of menopausal 
status.
CONCLUSION: Knee extensor muscle strength and CRF were associated additively, 
not synergistically, with bone health. Maintaining high levels of both physical 
fitness components may improve musculoskeletal health in the cohort. The 
relationship between physical fitness and bone status should be longitudinally

Though viruses have their own genomes, many depend on the nuclear environment of 
their hosts for replication and survival. A substantial body of work has 
therefore been devoted to understanding how viral and eukaryotic genomes 
interact. Recent advances in chromosome conformation capture technologies have 
provided unprecedented opportunities to visualize how mammalian genomes are 
organized and, by extension, how packaging of nuclear DNA impacts cellular 
processes. Recent studies have indicated that some viruses, upon entry into host 
cell nuclei, produce factors that alter host chromatin topology, and thus, 
impact the 3D organization of the host genome. Additionally, a variety of 
distinct viruses utilize host genome architectural factors to advance various 
aspects of their life cycles. Indeed, human gammaherpesviruses, known for 
establishing long-term reservoirs of latent infection in B lymphocytes, utilize 
3D principles of genome folding to package their DNA and establish latency in 
host cells. This manipulation of host epigenetic machinery by latent viral 
genomes is etiologically linked to the onset of B cell oncogenesis. Small DNA 
viruses, by contrast, are tethered to distinct cellular sites that support virus 
expression and replication. Here, we briefly review the recent findings on how 
viruses and host genomes spatially communicate, and how this impacts 
virus-induced pathology.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, causing considerable burden 
and mortality. Demographic and lifestyle transitions in low and low-middle 
income countries have given rise to its increased incidence. The successful 
management of cancer relies on evidence-based policies taking into account 
national epidemiologic settings. We aimed to report the national and subnational 
trends of breast cancer incidence, mortality, years of life lost (YLL) and 
mortality to incidence ratio (MIR) since 1990. As part of the National and 
Subnational Burden of Diseases project, we estimated incidence, mortality and 
YLL of breast cancer by sex, age, province, and year using a two-stage 
spatio-temporal model, based on the primary dataset of national cancer and death 
registry. MIR was calculated as a quality of care indicator. Age-period-cohort 
analysis was used to distinguish the effects of these three collinear factors. A 
significant threefold increase in age-specific incidence at national and 
subnational levels along with a twofold extension of provincial disparity was 
observed. Although mortality has slightly decreased since 2000, a positive 
mortality annual percent change was detected in patients aged 25-34 years, 
leading to raised YLLs. A significant declining pattern of MIR and lower 
provincial MIR disparity was observed. We observed a secular increase of breast 
cancer incidence. Further evaluation of risk factors and developing national 
screening policies is recommended. A descending pattern of mortality, YLL and 
MIR at national and subnational levels reflects improved quality of care, even 
though mortality among younger age groups should be specifically addressed.

Lumbar Spinal Canal Stenosis from the Perspective of Locomotive Syndrome and 
Metabolic Syndrome: A Narrative Review.

University, Aichi, Japan.

Patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSS) have impaired activities of 
daily living because of pain or motor paralysis, but no effective preventive 
treatment is currently available. The number of patients with LSS is predicted 
to continually increase as the average age of the global population increases. 
To provide a conceptual framework for improving healthy life expectancy, the 
Japanese Orthopaedic Association introduced the concept of locomotive syndrome, 
to which LSS is related. Ours and other studies have shown that LSS exacerbates 
locomotive syndrome and that surgical treatment is one method for improving it. 
Furthermore, we propose that the two-step test, a locomotive syndrome risk test, 
is effective for assessing the risk for falls and severity of LSS. Meanwhile, 
lumbar spinal epidural lipomatosis (LSEL), which is a manifestation of LSS, has 
been shown to be related to metabolic syndrome. Previous studies have suggested 
that the whole LSS can be also associated with metabolic syndrome. Although 
locomotive syndrome is very different from metabolic syndrome, which involves 
lipid metabolism, these two syndromes overlap, such as in LSS. Conducting 
research on LSS from the perspectives of both locomotive syndrome and metabolic 
syndrome may lead to novel methods for prevention and treatment of LSS and, 
conversely, may yield clues for resolving symptoms of the two syndromes. This 
review provides an overview of LSS from the perspective of locomotive syndrome 
and metabolic syndrome, along with findings from our research group.

Despite the same latitude on earth, Israel and South Africa have a wide variety 
of healthcare systems and approaches. Israel is a developed country with life 
expectancy within the first decile of the modern world. South Africa is a 
developing country where available resources and health care varies greatly 
across the country. Israeli policy makers have realized in 1999 the importance 
of early surgery for hip fractures as the single most important factor 
contributing to decreased mortality. After an introduction of a newer 
reimbursement system in 2004, and public advertising of early hip fracture 
treatment as a quality tag for hospitals, in more than 85% of the cases patients 
are operated on early (within 8 hours) with a significant decrease in mortality. 
However, other issues such as patient preparation, rehabilitation, and 
prevention are still at their beginning. South Africa deals with significant 
challenges with high energy hip fractures in a younger population, although 
osteoporosis is on the rise in certain parts of the country. Due to limited 
resources and distances, time to surgery differs among hospital systems in the 
country. In public hospitals, a delay up to a week may be common, whereas in 
private hospitals most patients are operated early within 48 to 72 hours. Due to 
decreased life expectancy, arthroplasty is more aggressively used in displaced 
femoral neck fractures. Rehabilitation is mostly done within the families. 
Prevention and orthogeriatric teamwork are not being commonly practiced. 
Generally speaking, more attention to hip fractures is needed from healthcare 
funders.

A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in El Salvador of an 
intervention ('Thula Sana') previously shown to enhance maternal sensitivity and 
infant security of attachment in a South African sample. In El Salvador, trained 
community workers delivered the intervention from late pregnancy to 6 months 
postpartum as part of a home-visiting programme. The sample comprised 64 
pregnant adolescent women, aged 14-19 years, living in predominantly rural 
settings. They were randomised to receive either the intervention or normal 
care. Demographic information was collected at baseline and, immediately 
post-intervention, blind assessments were made of parental sensitivity and 
infant emotion regulation. The intervention was found to have a substantial 
positive impact on maternal sensitivity. Further, compared to control group, 
infants in the intervention group showed more regulated behaviour: in a social 
challenge task they showed more attempts to restore communication, and in a 
non-social challenge task they showed more social and goal-directed behaviour. 
This replication and extension of the South African findings in a small El 
Salvador sample shows promise and justifies the conduct of a large-scale RCT in 
a Central or South American context.

sobre una intervención (‘Thula Sana’) que previamente había mostrado en un grupo 
muestra sudafricano el mejoramiento de la sensibilidad materna y la seguridad de 
la afectividad del infante. En El Salvador, trabajadores entrenados de la 
comunidad llevaron la intervención como parte de un programa de visitas a casa a 
partir de la última etapa del embarazo hasta seis meses después del parto. El 
grupo muestra estuvo compuesto por 64 mujeres adolescentes embarazadas, de entre 
14 y 19 años, que vivían en áreas predominantemente rurales. Ellas fueron 
asignadas al azar para recibir o la intervención o el cuidado normal. Al inicio, 
se recogió la información demográfica e, inmediatamente después de la 
intervención, se llevaron a cabo evaluaciones ciegas sobre la sensibilidad de la 
progenitora y la regulación de la emoción del infante. Se determinó que la 
intervención tenía un impacto positivo considerable sobre la sensibilidad 
materna. Es más, comparados con el grupo de control, los infantes en el grupo de 
intervención mostraron una conducta más regulada: en una tarea de reto social 
mostraron más intentos de restaurar la comunicación, y en una tarea que no era 
de reto social, mostraron una conducta más sociable y enfocada en el objetivo. 
La reproducción y extensión de los resultados sudafricanos en un pequeño grupo 
muestra en el Salvador es prometedora y justifica que se lleve a cabo un ensayo 
controlado al azar (RCT) a mayor escala dentro de un contexto centro o 
suramericano.

L’échantillon a consisté en 64 adolescentes enceintes, âgées de 14 à 19 ans, 
vivant principalement en milieux ruraux. Elles ont été randomisées afin de

l'intervention des évaluations aveugles ont été faites de la sensibilité 
parentale et de la régulation de l’émotion du bébé. Nous avons trouvé que 
l'intervention s'est avérée avoir un impact positif important sur la sensibilité 
maternelle. De plus, comparés au groupe contrôle, les nourrissons du groupe 
d'intervention ont fait preuve de plus de comportement régulé: lors d'une tâche 
de défi sociale ils ont fait preuve de plus de tentatives pour restaurer la 
communication et durant une tâche de défi non-social ils ont fait preuve d'un 
comportement plus social et plus orienté vers un but. Cette réplique et

Pilotstudie mit jugendlichen Müttern in El Salvador In El Salvador wurde eine 
randomisierte kontrollierte Pilotstudie mit einer Intervention („Thula Sana“) 
durchgeführt, bei der zuvor an einer südafrikanischen Stichprobe gezeigt werden 
konnte, dass sie sowohl mütterliche Sensibilität als auch kindliche

jugendliche Frauen im Alter von 14 bis 19 Jahren, die in überwiegend ländlichen 
Regionen lebten. Sie wurden randomisiert entweder der Interventionsgruppe oder 
einer Kontrollgruppe zugeteilt, die die übliche Betreuung erhielt. Zu 
Studienbeginn wurden demografische Daten gesammelt und unmittelbar nach der 
Intervention wurden verblindet Beurteilungen der elterlichen Sensibilität und 
der kindlichen Emotionsregulation vorgenommen. Es wurde festgestellt, dass die 
Intervention einen signifikanten positiven Einfluss auf die mütterliche 
Sensibilität hat. Im Vergleich zur Kontrollgruppe zeigten Säuglinge in der 
Interventionsgruppe ein stärker reguliertes Verhalten: Bei einer Aufgabe mit 
sozialer Herausforderung zeigten sie mehr Versuche, die Kommunikation 
wiederherzustellen, und bei einer Aufgabe mit einer nicht-sozialen 
Herausforderung zeigten sie mehr soziales und zielgerichtetes Verhalten. Diese 
Replikation und Erweiterung der südafrikanischen Ergebnisse in einer kleinen

すでに南アフリカの対象者に関して報告されている、母親の感受性と乳児の安定したアタッチメントを向上させるための介入“トゥラサナ”の予備的な無作為化比較試験がエルサルバドルで実施された。エルサルバドルでは、訓練を受けた自治体の職員が家庭訪問プログラムの一環として、妊娠後期から産後6か月まで介入を提供した。対象者は、主に農村部に住む14〜19歳の青年期の妊婦64名であった。対象者は、この介入もしくは通常のケアのいずれかを受けるように無作為に振分けられた。ベースラインとして人口統計学的情報が収集され、介入直後に、養育の感受性と乳児の感情調整について盲検評価が行われた。この介入は、母親の感受性に実質的な正の影響を与えることがわかった。さらに、介入群の乳児は対照群と比較して、より調整された行動を示した。すなわち、社会的挑戦課題ではコミュニケーションを回復するためにより多くの試みを示し、非社会的挑戦課題において、より社会的で目標志向的な行動を示した。エルサルバドルの小規模サンプルにおいて南アフリカでの実施知見の再現と拡張が見られたことは、中南米の状況における大規模なRCT 
(無作為化比較試験) の実施に見込みと正当性があることを示している。.

OBJECTIVE: The aim: To analyze the data of social health determinants - life 
expectancy of population and infant mortality in neighboring countries: Ukraine 
and Poland in cut-away of territory habitation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The statistical materials of the 
Ukrainian and Polish information sources were used in this work: SI "The center 
of medical statistics of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine", The state 
statistics service of Ukraine, The central statistical management of Poland 
(Główny Urząd Statystyczny). Methods of system approach, bibliosemantic, 
statistical, analytical were used for analysis.
RESULTS: Results: In both countries, Poland and Ukraine, the general dynamics as 
to the growth of an average life expectancy (ALE) among men and women was 
observed during 28 years of surveillance, and in both countries it was revealed 
that the ALE indices in women were much higher than in men. Within the last five 
years, there is a considerable tendency of decrease in the infant death rate in 
Ukraine, while in Poland this index is particularly invariable. This may be due 
to the fact that the level of infant mortality in Poland is half the level in 
Ukraine; moreover, this correlation is approximate within the last five years of 
observation. A significant place in the structure of all the causes of infant 
mortalityin 2019 is occupied by the ХVІ chapter in accordance with ICD-10 
"Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period" - 54.39 % in Ukraine 
and 53.05 % in Poland, the last - "Diseases of the Urogenital system" (chapter 
ХІV) - 0 % and 0.7 %, correspondingly.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: With a view of an incessant improvement of a 
high-quality information which is registered when the statistical data are 
formed, it is necessary to promote a broad intersector cooperation inside the 
countries and international collaboration between the countries.

Repurposing Licensed Drugs for Use Against Alzheimer's Disease.

Norins LC(1).

Author information:
(1)Alzheimer's Germ Quest, Naples, FL, USA.

Substantial evidence, composed of drug mechanisms of action, in vivo testing, 
and epidemiological data, exists to support clinical testing of FDA-approved 
drugs for repurposing to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Licensed 
compound investigation can often proceed at a faster and more cost-effective 
manner than un-approved compounds moving through the drug pipeline. As the 
prevalence of AD increases with life expectancy, the current rise in life 
expectancy amalgamated with the lack of an effective drug for the treatment of 
AD unnecessarily burdens our medical system and is an urgent public health 
concern. The unfounded reluctance to examine repurposing existing drugs for 
possible AD therapy further impedes the possibility of improving the quality of 
patient lives with a terminal disease. This review summarizes some evidence 
which exists to suggest certain already-approved drugs may be considered for the 
treatment of AD and will perhaps encourage physicians to off-label prescribe 
these safe therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness and fatigability, the prominent symptoms of 
autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG), negatively impact daily function and quality 
of life (QoL). It is currently unclear as to what extent symptoms limit activity 
and whether physical activity (PA) behaviours are associated with reduced QoL.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe habitual PA patterns and explore 
relationships between PA metrics, clinical MG characteristics, and 
health-related QoL (HRQoL).
METHODS: PA data from a tri-axial trunk accelerometer worn for seven days, was 
collected from females with generalized, stable MG and compared to control 
subjects. MG-specific evaluations, the six-minute walk test and knee extension 
strength were assessed in individuals with MG (IwMG). Mann-Whitney tests were 
used to study between-group differences. Spearman rank correlation coefficient 
was performed to explore relationships between variables.
RESULTS: Thirty-three IwMG (mean (SD) age 45 (11) years) and 66 control subjects 
were included. IwMG perform less vigorous-intensity PA than control subjects 
(p = 0.001), spend more time sedentary (p = 0.02) and engage in less and shorter 
durations of moderate-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA). For IwMG, habitual PA 
correlated positively with 6 min walking distance (rho = 0.387, p = 0.029) and 
negatively with body mass index (rho = -0.407, p = 0.019). We did not find any 
association between PA or sedentary behaviour and; HRQoL, symptom severity nor 
lower limb strength.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with stable MG perform less PA, at lower intensities, 
and are more inactive than control individuals. Further research is warranted to 
understand factors influencing PA patterns in MG and whether interventions could 
be successful in increasing PA quantity and intensity in IwMG.
