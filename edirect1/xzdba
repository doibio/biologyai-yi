Inflammation has been linked to the development of nonmotor symptoms in 
Parkinson's disease (PD), which greatly impact patients' quality of life and can 
often precede motor symptoms. Suitable animal models are critical for our 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease and the associated prodromal 
disturbances. The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine 
(MPTP)-treated monkey model is commonly seen as a "gold standard" model that 
closely mimics the clinical motor symptoms and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic 
loss of PD, however MPTP toxicity extends to other nondopaminergic regions. Yet, 
there are limited reports monitoring the MPTP-induced progressive central and 
peripheral inflammation as well as other nonmotor symptoms such as 
gastrointestinal function and microbiota. We report 5 cases of progressive 
parkinsonism in non-human primates to gain a broader understanding of 
MPTP-induced central and peripheral inflammatory dysfunction to understand the 
potential role of inflammation in prodromal/pre-motor features of PD-like 
degeneration. We measured inflammatory proteins in plasma and CSF and performed 
[18F]FEPPA PET scans to evaluate translocator proteins (TSPO) or microglial 
activation. Monkeys were also evaluated for working memory and executive 
function using various behavior tasks and for gastrointestinal hyperpermeability 
and microbiota composition. Additionally, monkeys were treated with a novel TNF 
inhibitor XPro1595 (10 mg/kg, n = 3) or vehicle (n = 2) every three days 
starting 11 weeks after the initiation of MPTP to determine whether XPro1595 
would alter inflammation and microglial behavior in a progressive model of PD. 
The case studies revealed that earlier and robust [18F]FEPPA PET signals 
resulted in earlier and more severe parkinsonism, which was seen in male cases 
compared to female cases. Potential other sex differences were observed in 
circulating inflammation, microbiota diversity and their metabolites. Additional 
studies with larger group sizes of both sexes would enable confirmation and 
extension of these findings. If these findings reflect potential differences in 
humans, these sex differences have significant implications for therapeutic 
development of inflammatory targets in the clinic.

INTRODUCTION: Detailed data on the life expectancy of patients with parkinsonism 
from the general population are largely lacking. This study aimed to determine 
the absolute life expectancy of patients newly-diagnosed with parkinsonism.
METHODS: This study was part of the Rotterdam Study, an ongoing, 
population-based cohort study in the Netherlands. We included 12,789 
participants of 50 years and older, free of parkinsonism. Patients diagnosed 
with parkinsonism were matched to controls on sex, birth year, dementia status, 
cancer status, and coronary heart disease status. We used Gompertz regression 
and lifetables to estimate the remaining life expectancy per year of age.
RESULTS: The mean age of our study population was 65.0 (SD 9.7) years and 57.6% 
were women. During an average follow-up of 12 years, 297 participants were 
diagnosed with parkinsonism. The mean age at parkinsonism diagnosis was 78.6 (SD 
8.1) years. Once diagnosed with parkinsonism, the life expectancy was lower than 
matched controls across a wide age range. At 65 years, the life expectancy of 
patients with parkinsonism was reduced with 6.7 [95% CI: 2.4;10.7] years 
compared to controls. At 85, the difference in life expectancy was 1.2 [95% CI: 
-2.2;4.5] years compared to controls.
CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with parkinsonism have a reduced life expectancy 
compared to their peers in the general population. The absolute life expectancy 
is mainly reduced if parkinsonism is diagnosed before the age of 70.

INTRODUCTION: The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data extracted from 
cancer-specific questionnaires are often non-preference based, while patient 
preference-based utility data are required for health economic evaluation. This 
study aimed to map Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) 
subscales onto the Short Form six Dimension as an independent instrument 
(SF-6Dv2ind-6) using the data gathered from patients with breast cancer.
METHODS: Data for 420 inpatient and outpatient patients with breast cancer were 
gathered from the largest academic center for cancer patients in Iran. The OLS 
and Tobit models were used to predict the values of the SF-6Dv2ind-6 with regard 
to the FACT-B subscales. Prediction accuracy of the models was determined by 
calculating the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The 
relationship between the fitted and observed SF-6Dv2ind-6 values was examined 
using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC). Goodness of fit of models 
was assessed using the predicted R2 (Pred R2) and adjusted R2 (Adj R2). A 
tenfold cross-validation method was used for validation of models.
RESULTS: Data of 416 patients with breast cancer were entered into final 
analysis. The model included main effects of FACT-B subscales, and statistically 
significant clinical and demographic variables were the best predictor for 
SF-6Dv2ind-6 (Model S3 of OLS with Adj R2 = 61.02%, Pred R2 = 59.25%, 
MAE = 0.0465, RMSE = 0.0621, ICC = 0.678, AIC = -831.324, BIC = -815.871).
CONCLUSION: The best algorithm developed for SF-6Dv2ind-6 enables researchers to 
convert cancer-specific instruments scores into preference-based scores when the 
data are gathered using cancer-specific instruments.

Purulent pericardial effusion is a rare and life-threatening complication of 
pyogenic liver abscess if not diagnosed and intervened early. Due to its 
nonspecific presentation, diagnosis of pyogenic liver abscess is challenging. 
Herein, we discuss the case of a 31-year-old healthy male that presented with 
acute chest tightness for one day in the setting of spontaneous rupture of 
pyogenic liver abscess and developed transdiaphragmatic extension of purulent 
pericardial effusion. The abscess resolved with antibiotic therapy 
(beta-lactam), ultrasound-guided aspiration, and pericardial window. Culture of 
pericardial fluid yielded the Streptococcus anginosus group. He was subsequently 
discharged following clinical resolution and normalization of liver function 
tests after 15 days of treatment. Follow-up ultrasonography revealed that the 
liver abscess and pericardial effusion were resolved in 8 weeks post treatment 
and intervention.

Systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg has been defined 
as stage I hypertension by the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines. 
Drug treatment is recommended for stage I hypertensive patients aged ≥65 years 
without cardiovascular disease in the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice 
Guidelines but not in the 2018 Chinese guidelines. However, the 
cost-effectiveness of drug treatment among this subgroup of Chinese patients is 
unclear. This study developed a microsimulation model to compare costs and 
effectiveness of drug treatment and nondrug treatment for the subgroup of stage 
I hypertensive patients over a lifetime horizon from a government affordability 
perspective. Event rates of mortality and cardiovascular complications were 
estimated from 3 cohorts in the Chinese population. Costs and health utilities 
were obtained from the national statistics report and published literature. The 
model predicted that drug treatment generated quality-adjusted life-years of 
13.52 and associated with expected costs of $6825 in comparison with 13.81 and 
$7328 produced by nondrug treatment over a lifetime horizon among stage I 
hypertensive patients aged ≥65 years without cardiovascular disease. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $8836/quality-adjusted life-year (the GDP per 
capita in 2017), drug treatment only had a 1.8% probability of being 
cost-effective compared with nondrug treatment after 10 000 probabilistic 
simulations. Sensitivity analysis of treatment costs, benefits expected from 
treatment, health utilities, and discount rates did not change the results. Our 
results suggested that drug treatment was not cost-effective compared with 
nondrug treatment for stage I hypertensive patients aged ≥65 years without 
cardiovascular disease in China.

PURPOSE: Premature mortality offers an alternative approach for monitoring the 
burden of mortality; however, little is known about its measures for stomach 
cancer. In the present study, we investigated temporal changes in premature 
mortality because of stomach cancer in the Japanese population from 1980 to 
2015.
METHODS: Mortality data for stomach cancer were obtained from the World Health 
Organization mortality database. Years of life lost (YLL) was calculated using 
Japanese life tables. The average lifespan shortened was calculated and defined 
as the ratio of YLL in relation to the expected lifespan.
RESULTS: Over a 35-year time frame, the age-standardized rates adjusted to the 
World Standard Population for deaths from stomach cancer substantially decreased 
in both sexes. The results from the average YLL (AYLL) measure showed that 
lifespan of stomach cancer patients was prolonged by about 3 and 5 years in men 
and women, respectively. The average lifespan shortened measure showed that 
stomach cancer led to a loss of 18.5% of lifespan among men and of 21.9% among 
women in 1980, but these numbers were reduced to 13.6% and 14.5%, respectively, 
in 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated decreasing trends in premature mortality for 
stomach cancer in Japan over a 35-year period.

BACKGROUND: While much effort has focused on quantifying disease burden in 
occupational health, no study has simultaneously assessed disease burden in 
terms of mortality and morbidity. We aimed to propose a new comprehensive method 
of quantifying the disease burden in the workplace.
METHODS: The data were obtained from the Japan Epidemiology Collaboration on 
Occupational Health (J-ECOH) Study, a large-scale prospective study of 
approximately 80,000 workers. We defined disease burden in the workplace as the 
number of working years lost among the working population during a 6-year period 
(April 2012 to March 2018). We calculated the disease burden according to 
consequences of health problems (ie, mortality, sickness absence [SA], and 
ill-health retirement) and disease category. We also calculated the age-group- 
(20-39 and 40-59 years old) and sex-specific disease burden.
RESULTS: The largest contributors to disease burden in the workplace were mental 
and behavioural disorders (47.0 person-years lost per 10,000 person-years of 
working years; ie, per myriad [proportion]), followed by neoplasms (10.8 per 
myriad) and diseases of the circulatory system (7.1 per myriad). While mental 
and behavioural disorders made a greater contribution to SA and ill-health 
retirement compared to mortality, the latter two disorders were the largest 
contributors to the disease burden in the workplace due to mortality. The number 
of working years lost was greater among younger versus older female 
participants, whereas the opposite trend was observed in males.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach is in contrast to those in previous studies that 
focused exclusively on mortality or morbidity.

BACKGROUND: We describe the evidence of the effects of early life exposures on 
health and aging during adulthood.
METHODS: A narrative review of cohorts and systematic reviews of studies 
initiated early in life and followed up to adulthood was conducted.
RESULTS: Most studies were carried out in developed countries. The long-term 
effects of birth weight and, to a lesser extent, height at birth on 
chronic-degenerative diseases, functionality, bone, renal and respiratory 
pathology, and mortality have been consistent. Breastfeeding is associated with 
metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and functionality. Adiposity, bone 
pathophysiology, functionality in old age, and high blood pressure are 
associated with socioeconomic status at birth.
CONCLUSIONS: Several exposures from intrauterine life to adolescence that exert 
discrete but significant effects on adult health have been consistently 
described. It is necessary to carry out these studies in developing countries.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: En este artículo se describe la evidencia acerca de los 
efectos de las exposiciones tempranas sobre la salud y el envejecimiento en la 
edad adulta.
MÉTODOS: Revisión narrativa de cohortes y revisiones sistemáticas de estudios 
iniciados en la vida temprana y seguidos hasta la edad adulta.
RESULTADOS: La mayoría de los estudios se realizaron en países desarrollados. 
Los efectos a largo plazo del peso al nacer, y en menor medida de la talla al 
nacer, en las enfermedades crónico-degenerativas, la funcionalidad, la 
fisiopatología ósea, renal y respiratoria, y la mortalidad, han sido 
consistentes. La lactancia materna se ha asociado con enfermedades metabólicas y 
cardiovasculares, y con la funcionalidad. La adiposidad, la fisiopatología ósea, 
la funcionalidad en la vejez y la hipertensión arterial están asociadas con el 
nivel socioeconómico al nacer.
CONCLUSIONES: Diferentes exposiciones desde la vida intrauterina hasta la 
adolescencia ejercen efectos discretos, pero significativos, sobre la salud de 
los adultos. Se requiere realizar estos estudios en las poblaciones que viven en 
países en desarrollo.

With improvements in treatments for primary tumor and brain metastases (BM), the 
life expectancy of patients with advanced cancers is increasing; thus, helping 
patients with BM maintain quality of life is becoming increasingly important. 
Sense of coherence (SOC) has been found to be closely related to health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic diseases, however, this 
relationship has not been validated in patients with BM. This study first 
examined the relationship between SOC and HRQoL in patients with BM, and further 
identified factors associated with SOC in these patients. Patients with BM 
reported lower scores for most of the functioning subscales and for the general 
rating of quality of life, and higher scores for most of the symptom subscales, 
compared with a normative sample. SOC was significantly correlated with most 
aspects of HRQoL in patients with BM. Further, SOC in the patients was 
associated with awareness of the disease, possession of religious belief, and 
type of primary cancer. These results validate the close relationship between 
SOC and HRQoL in patients with BM, and indicate that SOC is associated with 
awareness of illness and religious belief.

life-threating nosocomial infection with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. 
Evolutions of multi-drug-resistant and hyper-virulent strains of K. pneumoniae 
make the situation worse. Currently, there is no incisive drug molecule 
available for drug-resistant hyper-virulent K. pneumoniae infection that 
emphasizes the need for identification of novel and more promising drug targets 
in K. pneumoniae. Recently, various non-canonical structures of nucleic acids 
especially G-quadruplex (G4) motifs have been identified as potential 
therapeutic targets against several human pathogenic bacteria and viruses 
including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, and Nipah. Therefore, in present study we 
screened the K. pneumoniae genomes for identification of evolutionary conserved 
G4 structure-forming motifs as promising anti-bacterial drug targets. 
Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of six highly conserved G4 motifs 
in the promoter region of five essential genes that play a critical role in 
nutrient transport and metabolism. Biophysical studies showed the formation of 
G4 structure by these conserved motifs. Circular Dichroism melting analysis 
showed the stabilization of these G4 motifs by a well-known G4-stabilizing 
agent, BRACO-19. The stabilization of these motifs by BRACO-19 was also able to 
stop the primer extension process, which is an essential phenomenon for 
expression of the G4-harboring gene. The addition of G4-specific ligand at low 
micromolar range was observed to be lethal for the growth of this bacteria and 
negatively controlled the expression of the G4-harboring genes via G4 structure 
stabilization. These observations strengthen the formation of G4 structures by 
the predicted G4 motif in vivo, which can be stabilized by G4 ligands like 
BRACO-19. This stabilization of G4 structures can attenuate the expression of 
G4-harboring essential genes and thus play a critical role in the regulation of 
gene expression. Thus, taking all given result in consideration, for the first 
time, this study showed the new therapeutic avenue for combating K. pneumoniae 
infection by characterizing the conserved G4 motifs as promising therapeutic 
targets.

Postnatal administration of phencyclidine (PCP) in rodents causes major brain 
dysfunction leading to severe disturbances in behavior lasting into adulthood. 
This model is routinely employed to model psychiatric disorders such as 
schizophrenia, as it reflects schizophrenia-related brain disturbances including 
increased apoptosis, and disruptions to myelin and plasticity processes. 
Leucine-rich repeat and Immunoglobin-like domain-containing protein 1 (Lingo-1) 
is a potent negative regulator of both axonal myelination and neurite extension. 
The Nogo receptor (NgR)/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor orphan Y (TROY) 
and/or p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75) complex, with no lysine (K) (WNK1) and 
myelin transcription factor 1 (Myt1) are co-receptors or cofactors in Lingo-1 
signaling pathways in the brain. We have examined the developmental trajectory 
of these proteins in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia using PCP to 
determine if Lingo-1 pathways are altered in the prefrontal cortex throughout 
different stages of life. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with PCP (10 mg/kg) 
or saline on postnatal days (PN)7, 9, and 11 and killed at PN12, 5 or 14 weeks 
for measurement of Lingo-1 signaling proteins in the prefrontal cortex. Myt1 was 
decreased by PCP at PN12 (P=0.045), and at 14 weeks PCP increased Lingo-1 
(P=0.037), TROY (P=0.017), and WNK1 (P=0.003) expression. This is the first 
study reporting an alteration in Lingo-1 signaling proteins in the rat 
prefrontal cortex both directly after PCP treatment in early development and in 
adulthood. We propose that Lingo-1 pathways may be negatively regulating 
myelination and neurite outgrowth following the administration of PCP, and that 
this may have implications for the cortical dysfunction observed in 
schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND: Goalball is a Paralympic sport for visually impaired athletes. 
Although it is widely practiced, a great variety of tests are adopted to 
evaluate athletes' physical fitness. Therefore, the objective was to identify 
the physical fitness tests adopted in this sport to find the common aspects 
between them and, eventually, to propose a standard operating procedure.
METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were adopted. The studies 
were extracted from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. A selection process by 
title, abstract, and full-text, according to the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, was performed. The results were discussed with narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: A total of 7 papers and 222 participants were included. A wide variety 
of tests were adopted and the Brockport Physical Fitness Test (BPFT) was the 
only battery included to evaluate general athletes' well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: Although few literature exists on Goalball, the BPFT could be the 
battery for evaluating Goalball athletes though the test battery should be 
standardized to the characteristics of this sport.

BACKGROUND: The Cancer-VTE Registry evaluates the occurrence and management of 
venous thromboembolism in Japanese participants with major solid tumors. Using 
Registry data, we evaluated the frequency of concurrent venous thromboembolism 
in cancer patients prior to treatment initiation by cancer type.
METHODS: The Cancer-VTE Registry is an ongoing (March 2017-September 2020) 
prospective cohort study using a nationwide, multicentre clinical registry. 
Participants aged ≥20 years with colorectal, lung, stomach, pancreatic, breast 
or gynecologic cancer, confirmed staging, ≥6 months life expectancy 
post-registration and who had undergone venous thromboembolism screening were 
managed with routine clinical care. Venous thromboembolism frequency at 
registration was evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 9735 participants, 571 (5.9%) had venous thromboembolism at 
baseline, including asymptomatic [5.5% (n = 540)] and symptomatic venous 
thromboembolism [0.3% (n = 31)]. Most participants with venous thromboembolism 
(n = 506, 5.2%) had deep vein thrombosis only; 65 (0.7%) had pulmonary embolism 
with/without deep vein thrombosis. The prevalence of distal and proximal deep 
vein thrombosis was 4.8% (n = 466) and 0.9% (n = 83), respectively. The highest 
prevalence of venous thromboembolism was for pancreatic cancer (8.5%) and the 
lowest for breast cancer (2.0%). Venous thromboembolism prevalence increased as 
cancer stage advanced.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there was a marked difference in venous thromboembolism by 
cancer type, the data suggest that cancer stage is an important risk factor for 
venous thromboembolism. Thus, metastasis seems a critical risk factor for venous 
thromboembolism. This is the first demonstration of venous thromboembolism 
prevalence and risk factors in Japanese cancer patients prior to treatment.

BACKGROUND: Cannabidiol (CBD) is a novel therapy for the treatment of 
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), a rare, treatment-refractory epileptic 
encephalopathy. Two pivotal trials found CBD 20 mg/kg/day conferred a reduction 
from baseline in median drop seizure frequency of 44% and 42%, respectively, 
compared with 22% and 17%, respectively, in the usual care arms. No economic 
evaluations have been published to date. This analysis assessed the cost 
effectiveness of CBD adjunct therapy compared with usual care alone in LGS from 
the US payer perspective.
METHODS: We developed a lifetime horizon Markov decision analytic model. 
Efficacy, healthcare costs (2020 US$), and health state utilities were 
ascertained from published clinical trials, retrospective analyses, and time 
trade-off interviews conducted in the UK, respectively. Fifteen-year-old 
patients entering the model transitioned to states representing a percentage 
reduction in drop seizure frequency from baseline, where they remained until 
reverting back to baseline drop seizure frequency, or death. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate parameter 
uncertainty, and scenario analyses investigated the impact of various 
assumptions. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%.
RESULTS: Compared with usual care alone, CBD yielded 0.7 additional 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and $314,900 additional healthcare 
expenditure, resulting in $451,800 per QALY. Uncertainty in health state 
utilities were the largest contributor to uncertainty in the results. Results 
from the 5000-simulation probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 0% 
chance of CBD being cost effective at a $150,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay 
threshold, with a 95% credible range for the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $325,300-$690,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: CBD does not appear to be a cost-effective therapeutic option in LGS 
patients at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY.

IMPORTANCE: Primary care physicians have limited time to discuss preventive 
care, but it is unknown how they prioritize recommended services.
OBJECTIVE: To understand primary care physicians' prioritization of preventive 
services.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This online survey was administered to 
primary care physicians in a large health care system from March 17 to May 12, 
2017. Physicians were asked whether they prioritize preventive services and 
which factors contribute to their choice (5-point Likert scale). Results were 
analyzed from July 8, 2017, to September 19, 2019.
EXPOSURES: A 2 × 2 factorial design of 2 hypothetical patients: (1) a 
50-year-old white woman with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, 
obesity, a 30-pack-year history of smoking, and a family history of breast 
cancer; and (2) a 45-year-old black man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
obesity, a 30-pack-year history of smoking, and a family history of colorectal 
cancer. Two visit lengths (40 minutes vs 20 minutes) were given. Each patient 
was eligible for at least 11 preventive services.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physicians rated their likelihood of discussing each 
service during the visit and reported their top 3 priorities for patients 1 and 
2. Physician choices were compared with the preventive services most likely to 
improve life expectancy, using a previously published mathematical model.
RESULTS: Of 241 physicians, 137 responded (57%), of whom 74 (54%) were 
female and 85 (62%) were younger than 50 years. Physicians agreed they 
prioritized preventive services (mean score, 4.27 [95% CI, 4.12-4.42] of 5.00), 
mostly by ability to improve quality (4.56 [95% CI, 4.44-4.68] of 5.00) or 
length (4.53 [95% CI, 4.40-4.66] of 5.00) of life. Physicians reported more 
prioritization in the 20- vs 40-minute visit, indicating that they were likely 
to discuss fewer services during the shorter visit (median, 5 [interquartile 
range {IQR}, 3-8] vs 11 [IQR, 9-13] preventive services for patient 1, and 4 
[IQR, 3-6] vs 9 [IQR, 8-11] for patient 2). Physicians reported similar top 3 
priorities for both patients: smoking cessation, hypertension control, and 
glycemic control for patient 1 and smoking cessation, hypertension control, and 
colorectal cancer screening for patient 2. Physicians' top 3 priorities did not 
usually include diet and exercise or weight loss (ranked in their top 3 
recommendations for either patient by only 48 physicians [35%]), although these 
were among the 3 preventive services most likely to improve life expectancy 
based on the mathematical model.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study, physicians prioritized 
preventive services under time constraints, but priorities did not vary across 
patients. Physicians did not prioritize lifestyle interventions despite large 
potential benefits. Future research should consider whether physicians and 
patients would benefit from guidance on preventive care priorities.

BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia, MDR-TB has become a significant public health threat; 
therefore, the Ministry of Health introduced two treatment approaches for MDR-TB 
cases: treatment initiative center (TIC) and treatment follow-up center (TFC). 
TIC is where patients usually are diagnosed and start the treatment. At TFC, we 
follow MDR-TB patients until they completed the treatment. However, there is no 
evidence about the cost-effectiveness of the approaches. Therefore, this study 
aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of MDR-TB treatment in TIC and TFC.
METHODS: In this study, we employed a full economic evaluation from a providers' 
perspective. We followed a hypothetical cohort of individuals from the age of 15 
for a lifetime using a Markov model with five mutually exclusive health states. 
We used both primary and secondary data sources for the study. Ingredient-based 
costing approach was used. The costs include healthcare provider costs 
(recurrent and capital cost) and patient-side costs (direct and indirect). We 
use a human capital approach to estimate the indirect cost. The cost estimates 
were reported in the 2017 United States Dollar (US$), and effectiveness was 
measured using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. Both costs and 
health benefits were discounted using a 3% discount rate. Both average and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were reported calculated. One-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were reported to determine the robustness 
of the estimates.
RESULTS: The cost per HIV negative patient successfully treated for MDR-TB was 
$8,416 at TIC and $6,657 at TFC. The average cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY 
averted at TFC was $671 and $1,417 per DALY averted at TIC. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MDR-TB treatment at TIC was $1,641 per DALYs 
averted.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the treatment of MDR-TB at both TIC and 
TFC are cost-effective interventions compared with the willingness to pay 
threshold of three-times the GDP per capita in Ethiopia.

OBJECTIVE: An upward trend in life expectancy has been observed in a majority of 
developed countries and leading to increasing in aging-related diseases. Aging 
is a risk factor for the development of widespread clinical conditions such as 
cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, cancer, infections. Although studies 
have been very active, the problem of aging still remains one of the most 
obscure aspects of human biology. Regulatory T (Treg) cells with 
immunosuppressive properties have a pivotal role in the maintenance of immune 
homeostasis. Alterations in Treg cell functionality appear to be of great 
importance in the development of immune senescence and contribute to increased 
susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases with age.
DESIGN: This review highlights recent findings regarding the age-related changes 
in the numbers and functional activity of human Tregs. Some of the mechanisms 
that maintain the balance of Tregs during human aging are discussed. The 
possible roles of Tregs in the pathogenesis of diseases associated with advanced 
age are also considered.
RESULTS: Age-related systemic changes, such as thymic involution, hormonal 
status, and epigenetic modifications, may affect the state of the Treg 
population and trigger various diseases. These changes involve decline or 
amplification in the functional activity of Tregs, an increase in the memory 
Treg subset and shifting of a Th17/Treg balance.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, the reviewed data suggest equal or even increased 
Treg functionality with age. Thus, age-mediated Treg expansion and higher Treg 
activity may contribute to elevated immune suppression and increased risk of 
infections and cancer.

Biotin protein ligase (BPL) is an essential enzyme in all kingdoms of life, 
making it a potential target for novel anti-infective agents. Whilst bacteria 
and archaea have simple BPL structures (class I and II), the homologues from 
certain eukaryotes such as mammals, insects and yeast (class III) have evolved a 
more complex structure with a large extension on the N-terminus of the protein 
in addition to the conserved catalytic domain. The absence of atomic resolution 
structures of any class III BPL hinders structural and functional analysis of 
these enzymes. Here, two new class III BPLs from agriculturally important moulds 
Botrytis cinerea and Zymoseptoria tritici were characterised alongside the 
homologue from the prototypical yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Circular 
dichroism and ion mobility-mass spectrometry analysis revealed conservation of 
the overall tertiary and secondary structures of all three BPLs, corresponding 
with the high sequence similarity. Subtle structural differences were implied by 
the different thermal stabilities of the enzymes and their varied Michaelis 
constants for their interactions with ligands biotin, MgATP, and 
biotin-accepting substrates from different species. The three BPLs displayed 
different preferences for fungal versus bacterial protein substrates, providing 
further evidence that class III BPLs have a 'substrate validation' activity for
