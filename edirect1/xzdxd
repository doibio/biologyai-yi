arthroplasty (THA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with hip arthrosis and an indication 
for THA were included (N = 123). Sagittal full-body radiographs were acquired in 
free standing position and in extension. QOL questionnaires were administered 
before and after surgery. Spinopelvic parameters were measured, including the 
pelvic-femur angle (PFA). Patients with low pelvic incidence (< 45°) were 
included in the hip contracture group if PFA > 5°, or PFA > -5° when pelvic 
incidence ≥ 45°.
RESULTS: 29% of patients were in the hip flexion contracture group, and they 
showed lower pelvic tilt than the no-contracture group (p < 0.001), larger 
lumbar lordosis (LL) and smaller PI-LL (p < 0.001), as well as a forward 
position of the head. 16% of patients still had hip contracture 12-months 
postop. Contracture patients showed higher QOL scores after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method to diagnose hip contracture group allowed to 
define a group of patients who showed a specific pattern of sagittal spinopelvic 
alignment. These patients improved their alignment and quality of life 
postoperatively, but their hip mobility was not always restored. Diagnosing 
these patients is a first step toward the development of more specific surgical 
approaches, aiming to improve their surgical outcome.

Multiclass Classification of Prostate Tumors Following an MR Image 
Analysis-Based Radiomics Approach.

Jaen-Lorites JM, Ruiz-Espana S, Pineiro-Vidal T, Santabarbara JM, Maceira AM, 
Moratal D.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men, with symptoms that may 
be confused with those caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. One of the key 
aspects of treating prostate cancer is its early detection, increasing life 
expectancy and improving the quality of life of those patients. However, the 
tests performed are often invasive, resulting in a biopsy. A non-invasive 
alternative is the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based PI-RADS v2 
classification. The aim of this work was to find objective biomarkers that allow 
the PI-RADS classification of prostate lesions using a radiomics approach on 
Multiparametric MRI. A total of 90 subjects were analyzed. From each segmented 
lesion, 609 different texture features were extracted using five different 
statistical methods. Two feature selection methods and eight multiclass 
predictive models were evaluated. This was a multiclass study in which the best 
AUC result was 0.7442 ± 0.0880, achieved with the Naïve Bayes model using a 
subset of 120 features. Valuable results were also obtained using the Random 
Forests model, obtaining an AUC of 0.7394 ± 0.0965 with a lower number of 
features (52). Clinical Relevance- The current study establishes a methodology 
for classifying prostate cancer and supporting clinical decision-making in a 
fast and efficient manner and avoiding additional invasive procedures using MRI.

Global warming in the twenty-first century has gradually made high temperatures 
a major threat to the global population. Health problems associated with extreme 
temperatures have become a growing public health concern worldwide. This study 
aimed to estimate road injuries stratified by sex, age, geographic location, and 
sociodemographic status attribute to high, low, and non-optimal temperatures in 
21 regional and global. We used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study Results 
Tool to examine the age-standardized death rates (ASDR) and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) due to road injuries in 2019 by Joinpoint regression. In 
addition, we reported high, low, and non-optimal temperature exposures for road 
injuries across different groups by gender, age, region, and disease. Moreover, 
we examined temporal trends in the burden of road disease caused by high, low, 
and non-optimum temperatures from 1990 to 2019. Trend analyzes were conducted 
for five sociodemographic index (SDI) regions. Globally, both ASDR and DALY 
declined from 1990 to 2019, with average annual percent change (AAPC) values 
of - 1.3% and - 1.2%, respectively. In 2019, the indicators (death and DALYs) 
steadily declined, while SDI quintile increased in most regions. Road injuries 
related to death and DALYs rate attributed to high temperatures were 0.17 and 
8.50, respectively, in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, DALYs for road injuries caused 
by low temperatures showed the most significant upward trend in most regions, 
especially in low-latitude countries. This study provides a comprehensive 
understanding of the road injury burden caused by high, low, and non-optimum 
temperatures, which remains high in regions with low SDI. Therefore, special 
attention should be paid to road injuries in poor countries or in areas with 
extreme temperatures.

The therapeutic outcomes of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have improved 
dramatically since tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) became available in 
clinical practice. Life expectancy of patients with CML is now close to that of 
the general population. Patients with CML who achieve sustained deep molecular 
response may discontinue TKI therapy. However, most patients still require TKI 
therapy for long periods without sustained deep molecular response. Given the 
awareness of increased incidence of arterial occlusive events in patients on TKI 
therapy, the optimal TKI selection should be based on age, comorbidities, risk 
classification, and goals of treatment. Dose optimization of TKI therapy reduces 
the incidence of adverse events while maintaining efficacy in CML.

Arabidopsis abscisic acid ABA-Insensitive RING Proteins (AtAIRP1-4) are RING E3s 
that play significant roles in ABA-signaling pathways. However, it is still 
unclear whether they have other functions. Here, AtAIRP4 was determined to play 
a role in response to gibberellin A3 (GA3) in Arabidopsis thaliana. After 
proAtAIRP4::GUS transgenic lines were treated with GA3, the GUS activity 
decreased in hypocotyls. Increased hypocotyl elongation in response to GA3 seen 
in WT was not observed in the AtAIRP4-overexpression lines, whereas 
AtAIRP4-overexpression lines were hypersensitive to Paclobutrazol (PAC, an 
inhibitor of GA biosynthesis) during the seed germination stage. Additionally, 
AtAIRP4-overexpressing lines showed the lowest level of primary root elongation 
in the presence of GA3. The levels of endogenous GA3 in 35S::AtAIRP4 lines were 
lower than those in wild-type. In addition, among the plants, the mRNA levels of 
the GA synthetic gene GIBBERELLIN 20-OXIDASE1 (GA20ox1) was the lowest in 
overexpressing line. However, the expression of the response gene DELLA 
RGA-LIKE3 (RGL3) was the highest in overexpressing lines after treatment with 
GA3. Thus, AtAIRP4 plays a negative role in GA-mediated hypocotyl elongation and 
root growth, and it inhibits the synthesis of endogenous biologically active GA3 
to some extent.

The movements of animal appendages are determined by extrinsic and intrinsic 
forces. Extrinsic forces include gravity or friction,1,2 whereas intrinsic 
forces are generated by active muscle contraction or passive musculoskeletal 
elements.3,4 For lightweight appendages, such as insect limbs, movements depend 
more upon intrinsic than extrinsic forces.5,6 Indeed, passive movements of 
insect limbs can be large and oppose or aid joint flexion, extension, or both.4 
Yet, how passive properties contribute to insects' goal-directed limb movements, 
such as targeted reaching and searching,7-10 remains unclear. Here, we show that 
mantids make targeted reaches and searches to objects by using their raptorial 
forelimbs, employing braking to slow passive flexion of the femoro-tibial (FTi) 
joint. In most reaches, tibial flexion ensures the forelimb contacts the object. 
Such tibial flexion is particularly clear when the forelimb misses the object 
and continues on a downward trajectory or during directed searching movements. 
We characterize the passive properties of the FTi joint by combining passive 
movements of excised limbs with apodeme ablations and muscle stimulation. These 
experiments show that passive properties of the flexor tibiae muscle-apodeme 
complex are the primary structural element producing tibial flexion in excised 
limbs. During reaching and searching, however, tibial flexion is slower and 
smaller than predicted. This is due to braking, which opposes passive flexion, 
thereby reducing the magnitude and velocity of tibial flexion. Braking retarding 
passive movements is a novel behaviorally relevant control strategy for the 
goal-directed movements of lightweight limbs, such as those of insects.

The UV-protection films based on renewable materials extracted from natural 
sources are being one of the most interesting targets for the packaging 
industry. In this paper, the UV-protection films were produced based on modified 
lignin and cellulose nanocrystals, both were extracted from the Argania 
nutshell. The lignin was extracted via the alkylation process followed by 
chemical modification using epichlorohydrin. The chemical modification and the 
in-use temperature range of the films were investigated via FTIR and TGA, where 
the chemical modification of lignin improves the thermal property which is an 
essential parameter during the thermo-sealing of food packaging. On the other 
hand, the CNCs were extracted via acid hydrolysis treatment with the smallest 
size around 300 nm generating smooth texture of films. Finally, the produced 
films were shown a maximum absorption of the UV light in the range of 450-200 nm 
and great results in food packaging.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 15 million people in the UK live with obesity, around 
5 million of whom have severe obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥35kg/m2). Having 
severe obesity markedly compromises health, well-being and quality of life, and 
substantially reduces life expectancy. These adverse outcomes are prevented or 
ameliorated by weight loss, for which sustained behavioural change is the 
cornerstone of treatment. Although NHS specialist 'Tier 3' Weight Management 
Services (T3WMS) support people with severe obesity, using individual and 
group-based treatment, the current evidence on optimal intervention design and 
outcomes is limited. Due to heterogeneity of severe obesity, there is a need to 
tailor treatment to address individual needs. Despite this heterogeneity, there 
are good reasons to suspect that a structured group-based behavioural 
intervention may be more effective and cost-effective for the treatment of 
severe obesity compared to usual care. The aims of this study are to test the 
feasibility of establishing and delivering a multi-centre randomised controlled 
clinical trial to compare a group-based behavioural intervention versus usual 
care in people with severe obesity.
METHODS: This feasibility randomised controlled study is a partially clustered 
multi-centre trial of PROGROUP (a novel group-based behavioural intervention) 
versus usual care. Adults ≥18 years of age who have been newly referred to and 
accepted by NHS T3WMS will be eligible if they have a BMI ≥40, or ≥35 kg/m2 with 
comorbidity, are suitable for group-based care and are willing to be randomised. 
Exclusion criteria are participation in another weight management study, planned 
bariatric surgery during the trial, and unwillingness or inability to attend 
group sessions. Outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation and 
success of blinding will be evaluated. Clinical measures will be collected at 
baseline, 6 and 12 months post-randomisation. Secondary outcome measures will be 
self-reported and collected remotely. Process and economic evaluations will be 
conducted.
DISCUSSION: This randomised feasibility study has been designed to test all the 
required research procedures and additionally explore three key issues; the 
feasibility of implementing a complex trial at participating NHS T3WMS, training 
the multidisciplinary healthcare teams in a standard intervention, and the 
acceptability of a group intervention for these particularly complex patients.

Obesity represents a risk factor for disability with a major bearing on life 
expectancy. Neuroimaging techniques are contributing to clarify its 
neurobiological underpinnings. Here, we explored whether structural brain 
abnormalities might accompany altered brain activations in obesity. We combined 
and compared data from brain activation studies for food stimuli and the data 
reported in structural voxel-based morphometry studies. We found that obese 
individuals have reduced grey matter density and functional activations in the 
thalamus and midbrain. A functional connectivity analysis based on these two 
clusters and its quantitative decoding showed that these regions are part of the 
reward system functional brain network. Moreover, we found specific grey matter 
hypo-densities in prefrontal cortex for the obese subjects, regions involved in 
controlled behaviour. These results support theories of obesity that point to 
reduced bottom-up reward processes (i.e., the Reward Deficit Theory), but also 
top-down theories postulating a deficit in cognitive control (i.e., the 
Inhibitory Control Deficit Theory). The same results also warrant a more 
systematic exploration of obesity whereby the reward of food and the intentional 
control over consummatory behaviour is manipulated.

Patients with disseminated cancer at higher risk for postoperative mortality see 
improved outcomes with altered clinical management. Being able to risk stratify 
patients immediately after their index surgery to flag high risk patients for 
healthcare providers is vital. The combination of physician uncertainty and a 
demonstrated optimism bias often lead to an overestimation of patient life 
expectancy which can precent proper end of life counseling and lead to 
inadequate postoperative follow up. In this cohort study of 167,474 
postoperative patients with multiple types of disseminated cancer, patients at 
high risk of 30-day postoperative mortality were accurately identified using our 
machine learning models based solely on clinical features and preoperative lab 
values. Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression 
machine learning models were developed on the cohort. Among 167,474 disseminated 
cancer patients, 50,669 (30.3%) died within 30 days of their index surgery; 
After preprocessing, 28 features were included in the model development. The 
cohort was randomly divided into 133,979 patients (80%) for training the models 
and 33,495 patients (20%) for testing. The extreme gradient boosting model had 
an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.926-0.931), the random forest model had an AUC of 0.93 
(95% CI: 0.930-0.934), and the logistic regression model had an AUC of 0.90 (95% 
CI: 0.900-0.906 the index operation. Ultimately, Machine learning models were 
able to accurately predict short-term postoperative mortality among a 
heterogenous population of disseminated cancer patients using commonly 
accessible medical features. These models can be included in electronic health 
systems to guide clinical judgements that affect direct patient care, 
particularly in low-resource settings.

Cancer is a leading cause of death in both developing and developed countries. 
With the increase in the average global life expectancy, it has become a major 
health problem and burden for most public healthcare systems worldwide. Due to 
the fewer side effects of natural compounds than of chemotherapeutic drugs, 
increasing scientific attention is being focused on the development of 
anti-cancer drugs derived from natural sources. Marine algae are an interesting 
source of functional compounds with diverse health-promoting activities. Among 
these compounds, polysaccharides have attracted considerable interest for many 
years because of their excellent anti-cancer abilities. They improve the 
efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs with relatively low toxicity to 
normal human cells. However, there are few reviews summarising the unique 
anti-cancer effects and underlying mechanisms of marine algae polysaccharides 
(MAPs). Thus, the current review focuses on updating the advances in the 
discovery and evaluation of MAPs with anti-cancer properties and the elucidation 
of their mechanisms of action, including the signalling pathways involved. This 
review aims to provide a deeper understanding of the anti-cancer functions of 
the natural compounds derived from medicinal marine algae and thereby offer a 
new perspective on cancer prevention and therapy with high effectiveness and 
safety.

BACKGROUND: As people living with HIV now have a life expectancy approaching 
that of the general population, clinical care focuses increasingly on the 
management and prevention of comorbidities and conditions associated with aging. 
We aimed to assess the prevalence of physical function (PF) limitation among gay 
and bisexual men (GBM) and determine whether HIV is associated with severe PF 
limitation in this population.
METHODS: We analysed cross-sectional data from GBM aged ≥55years in the 
Australian Positive and Peers Longevity Evaluation Study who completed a 
self-administered survey on health and lifestyle factors. PF was measured using 
the Medical Outcomes Study-Physical Functioning scale. Factors associated with 
severe PF limitation were assessed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 381 men: 186 without HIV and 195 with HIV. 
Median age was 64.3years for GBM without HIV and 62.1years for GBM with HIV. 
Compared with men without HIV, those with HIV had higher proportions of severe 
(13.3% vs 8.1%) and moderate-to-severe (26.7% vs 24.2%) PF limitation. Severe PF 
limitation commonly involved difficulty with vigorous activity (95% with severe 
PF limitation described being limited a lot), climbing several flights of stairs 
(68.4% limited a lot), bending, kneeling or stooping (60.5% limited a lot), and 
walking 1km (55.0% limited a lot). In a model adjusted for age, body mass index, 
typical duration of physical activity, psychological distress, and number of 
comorbidities, we found a significant association between HIV and severe PF 
limitation (adjusted odds ratio 3.3 vs not having HIV, 95% confidence interval 
1.3-8.7).
CONCLUSIONS: The biological mechanisms underlying this association require 
further investigation, particularly given the growing age of the HIV population 
and inevitable increase in the burden of PF limitation.

Despite establishing a so-called universal, taxpayer funded health system from 
1938, New Zealand's health system has never delivered equitable health outcomes 
for its indigenous population, the Māori people. This article, using a case 
study approach focusing on Māori, documents these historic inequalities and 
discusses policy attempts to address them from the 1970s when the principles of 
the Treaty of Waitangi were first introduced in legislation. This period is one 
of increasing self-determination for Māori, but notwithstanding this, Māori 
continued to have significantly shorter life expectancy than the population as a 
whole and suffered poor health at much higher rates. Neo-liberal policies were 
introduced and expanded during the 1980s and 1990s in New Zealand, including in 
healthcare from the early 1990s. The introduction of the purchaser-provider 
split in health services and the focus on devolving responsibility to 
communities provided an opportunity for Māori health providers to be 
established. However, the neo-liberal economic and social welfare policies 
implemented during this time also worked against Māori and adversely affected 
their health. By analysing attempts to reduce inequity in health outcomes for 
Māori, we explore why these collective attempts, including by Māori themselves, 
did not result in overall improved health and increased life expectancy for 
Māori. There was often a significant gap between government rhetoric and action, 
and we suggest that a predominantly universal healthcare system did not 
accommodate cultural and ethnic differences, and this is a potential explanation 
for the failure to reduce inequities. While this is true for all minority ethnic 
groups it is even more crucial for Māori as New Zealand's tangata whenua (first 
people) who had been progressively disadvantaged under colonialism. However, the 
seeds of ideas around Māori-led healthcare were planted in this period and have 
become part of the current Labour Government's policy on health reform.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative biomechanics after hip arthroscopy for 
femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) are an outcome of interest, but 
correlation with patient-reported outcomes (PROs) remains unclear.
PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation 
between changes in hip biomechanics in FAIS patients after hip arthroscopy and 
changes in PRO scores. We hypothesized that gait analysis would demonstrate 
significant correlations between pre- and postoperative changes in biomechanics 
and changes in PRO scores.
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study.
METHODS: FAIS patients without dysplasia or arthritis who underwent primary hip 
arthroscopy for labral repair and femoroplasty underwent preoperative and 1-year 
postoperative 3-dimensional motion tracking and biomechanical testing during 
normal gait. Joint kinematics calculated included flexion/extension (sagittal 
plane), abduction/adduction (frontal plane), and internal/external rotation 
(transverse plane). Peak hip angles and moments were compared between baseline 
and 1-year postoperative measures. At baseline, 1-year, and 2-year 
postoperatively, patients completed the following PRO surveys: 12-Item Short 
Form Health Survey (SF-12), modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), and Hip disability 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). Joint kinematics that significantly 
improved 1 year after surgery were assessed for correlations with PRO scores.
RESULTS: A total of 10 patients (12 hips) were enrolled prospectively. PROs 
significantly improved at 1 and 2 years postoperatively compared with baseline 
values for HOOS, mHHS, and SF-12 Physical Component Score, with all patients 
achieving the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) on the HOOS 
Sport/Recreation and Quality of Life subscales. From preoperatively to 1-year 
postoperatively, significant improvements were seen in peak hip abduction angle 
(from -2.3° ± 1.8° to -4.6° ± 1.8°; P = .0058) and peak hip extension moment 
(from -1.03 ± 0.19 to -0.85 ± 0.20 N·m/kg; P = .014); however, there were no 
significant correlations between these changes and the pre- to postoperative 
changes on any PRO scores.
CONCLUSION: Gait analysis of FAIS patients after hip arthroscopy demonstrated 
small, albeit significant, changes in postoperative hip kinetics and kinematics; 
however, these changes did not correlate with the large, clinically significant 
improvements in PROs at 1 year after surgery.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that the degree of 
improvement in short-term PROs after hip arthroscopy for FAIS may not be related 
to small changes in biomechanics postoperatively.

Health-related quality of life in hemoglobinopathies: A systematic review from a 
global perspective.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia are inherited blood 
disorders, which can lead to life-threatening events and chronic organ damage. 
Recent advances in treatments have increased life expectancy, and 
hemoglobinopathies have become chronic illnesses with social and emotional 
impairments. Thus, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessment has a 
fundamental role in disease management and treatment, and generic and 
disease-specific questionnaires are reliable and validated measures to estimate 
disease burden. The heterogeneous distribution of treatment opportunities 
worldwide influences physical, social, and emotional disease perception.
OBJECTIVES: To review publications concerning HRQOL for SCD and thalassemia in 
different areas of the world in order to gather a global perspective of 
questionnaires used and outcomes evaluated.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted according to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
guidelines. The Medline databases were searched on 29 September 2021. Inclusion 
criteria were as follows: (1) studies of HRQOL assessment in SCD and thalassemia 
patients by using the PROMIS, the SF-36, the SCSES, the PedsQL-SCD, the PedsQOL 
generic core scale, the ASCQ-Me, and the TranQoL; and (2) every article type, 
including non-English studies. We excluded studies that were not limited to SCD 
or thalassemia and studies that were not specific to hemoglobinopathies, and not 
consistent with the topic of HRQOL assessment. We did not include the gray 
literature. A total of 102 out of 124 articles from PubMed, Cochrane Library, 
and Google Scholar were eligible for inclusion (66 SCD articles and 36 
thalassemia articles). The quality of studies was assessed through Critical 
Appraisal tools for use in JBI Systematic Reviews. Data extraction was conducted 
using a standardized data collection form (authors, year and country of 
publication, study design, age and number of patients, HRQOL questionnaires, 
questionnaire language, and clinical outcomes).
RESULTS: The evaluation of HRQOL was conducted on all continents, but 
differences in the worldwide frequency of HRQOL assessment were observed. HRQOL 
of SCD patients was less investigated in Europe. HRQOL of thalassemia patients 
was less investigated in South-East Asia and Africa. Generic HRQOL 
questionnaires (PROMIS, SF-36, and PedsQL) were frequently adopted, while 
disease-specific ones (ASCQ-Me, SCSES for SCD, and TranQoL for thalassemia) were 
less used. Translation into local languages has been often performed.
CONCLUSION: Health-related quality of life is a complex outcome that has been 
increasingly incorporated in clinical research and clinical practice worldwide, 
although with regional differences. Disease-specific outcomes (pain for SCD and 
transfusion burden for thalassemia) and healthcare system characteristics, 
particularly in low-income countries, have an impact on HRQOL and should be 
considered in healthcare plans.

Objectives: This paper examines the gender gap in unhealthy life expectancy 
across education levels and age in Spain to understand the extent to which the 
gender paradox exists over education and across ages. Methods: Death 
registrations and vital status were taken from the Spanish Statistical Office, 
while the three health measures (chronic conditions, bad-self rated health and 
cognitive impairment) from the 2019 European Health Interview Survey. We used 
Sullivan's method to compute unhealthy life expectancy by education level. We 
computed the gender and the education ratios of the proportion of unhealthy life 
years in each health measure by education and age. Results: At almost all ages 
and all education levels, women significantly lived longer but in poorer health 
than men. Marked gender differences are seen across most age-groups, 
particularly among the low educated. We detected greater health inequalities by 
education level for women (confirming the gender paradox) and a health gradient 
due to aging and across the health measures charting the disablement process. 
Conclusion: The new education distribution might improve the unhealthy life 
expectancy and might reduce the gender gap in the number of years spent in poor 
health.

In cancer patients, a cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a prevalent occurrence. 
When a patient has both heart disease and cancer, the treatment can be 
complicated because treatment for one condition can have an adverse effect on 
the outcome of the other. A cardiovascular disease that involves heart failures, 
coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, pericardial diseases, arrhythmias, and 
valve and vascular dysfunction is a serious worry for long-term cancer patients. 
Because preclinical research is limited, it is critical to comprehend the 
pathophysiology of CVD as a consequence of anticancerous therapies while taking 
into account the developing and expanding heart. As a result, in this research, 
we look at the epidemiological characteristics of cancer patients who also have 
cardiovascular illness. Low-dose chest computed tomography, cardiac CT, and 
cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to acquire the data and 
perform the screening. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as anthracyclines and 
trastuzumab are used to treat the condition. Univariate analysis is used to 
examine risk factors and predict cardiovascular damage. Sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, life 
expectancy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and longitudinal strain 
are among the metrics examined.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (HPVOPSCC) usually affects a younger patient population. As such, the 
risk for long term toxicity associated with therapy is an important 
consideration. Multiple trials focused on de-escalation of therapy to preserve 
survival outcomes while minimizing treatment toxicity are currently in progress, 
however the question of which patients are ideal candidates for de-escalation 
remains unanswered. Circulating tumor DNA (cfHPVDNA) has emerged as a means of 
monitoring disease in patients with HPVOPSCC. Undetectable postoperative 
cfHPVDNA levels portend a better prognosis and by extension, may identify ideal 
candidates for de-escalation therapy. We propose an overview and rationale for a 
new institutional clinical trial protocol focusing on the use of cfHPVDNA to 
risk stratify patients for adjuvant therapy. We hypothesize that many surgical 
patients currently receiving radiation therapy may be clinically observed 
without adjuvant therapy.
METHODS: Patients with measurable cfHPVDNA and clinically resectable HPVOPSCC 
will undergo TORS resection of tumors and neck dissection. Patients with 
undetectable cfHPVDNA at 3 weeks post-op will be allocated to low or high-risk 
treatment protocol groups. The low risk group consists of patients with <4 
positive lymph nodes, ≤2 mm extranodal extension (ENE), and perineural invasion 
(PNI) or lymphovascular invasion (LVI) alone. The high-risk group is made up of 
patients with ≥4 positive lymph nodes, gross ENE, positive margins, N2c disease 
and/or the combination of both PNI and LVI. The low-risk group will be allocated 
to an observation arm, while the high-risk group will receive 46 Gy of adjuvant 
radiotherapy and weekly cisplatin therapy. The primary outcome of interest is 
2-year disease recurrence with secondary outcomes of 2-year disease free 
survival, locoregional control, overall survival, and quality of life measures. 
A sample of 126 patients in the low-risk group and 73 patients in the high-risk 
group will be required to evaluate non-inferiority to the standard of care.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide much needed recurrence and survival data for 
patients that undergo primary TORS followed by observation or de-escalated 
adjuvant therapy. Additionally, it will help delineate the role of cfHPVDNA in 
the risk stratification of patients that undergo treatment de-intensification.

Against the backdrop of population aging and growing strain on pension systems, 
monitoring the development of Working Life Expectancy (WLE) is vital to assess 
whether the policies taken are effective. This is the first study investigating 
time trends and educational inequalities in WLE based on German health insurance 
data. The analyses are based on the data of the AOK Lower Saxony (N = 3,347,912) 
covering three time periods (2006-08, 2011-13, and 2016-18). WLE is defined as 
years spent in the labor force (i.e. in employment and unemployment) and was 
calculated for each age between 18 and 69 years for the three periods to depict 
changes over time using multistate life table analysis. Educational inequalities 
in 2011-13 are reported for two educational levels (8-11 years and 12-13 years 
of schooling). WLE increased in both sexes with increases being stronger among 
women. This holds irrespective of whether WLE at age 18 (35.8-38.3 years in men, 
27.5-34.0 years in women) or the older working-age (e.g. at age 50 10.2-11.7 
years in men, 7.8-10.5 years in men) is considered. Among women at all ages and 
men from their mid-20s onwards, WLE was higher among higher-educated 
individuals. Inequalities were most pronounced among women (e.g. Δ3.1 years in 
women, Δ1.3 years in men at age 50). The study supports previous research 
indicating that measures to extend working life are effective, but that 
noticeable inequalities in WLE exist. Health insurance data represent a valuable 
source for such research that has so far remained untapped. The data provide a 
suitable basis to investigate trends and inequalities in WLE. Future research 
should build on the strengths of the data by broadening the research towards a 
more comprehensive analysis of the development of WLE from a health perspective.

Frailty in the context of COVID-19 pandemic: A life-threatening condition.

da Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.

The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused emerging 
challenges for healthcare systems regarding the assistance to the older adult 
population which, added to the increased life expectancy, may be exposing frail 
older adults to an increased risk of unfavorable health outcomes. Frailty has a 
pathogenesis of multifactorial etiology and is defined as a condition 
characterized by progressive decline in physiological function, weakness, 
decreased strength, and reduced resilience to stressors, leading to 
vulnerability and an increased risk of fractures, falls, institutionalization, 
and death. In the context of COVID-19, frail older adults accounted for 
approximately 51% of hospitalized patients with confirmed cases and elevated 
risk of mortality in-hospital. In addition, frailty may be associated with 
recent "excess mortality" reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 
terms of the full death toll associated directly (due to the disease) or 
indirectly (due to the pandemic's impact on health systems and society) to 
COVID-19. Therefore, this mini review aimed to provide a summarized discussion 
from meta-analyses data regarding the impact of frailty in community-dwelling 
older adults hospitalized with COVID-19 on short-term mortality risk.
