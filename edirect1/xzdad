PURPOSE: The Attune® Knee System provides new instrumentation to achieve 
symmetric flexion/extension gaps in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, 
there is limited information on the optimal TKA technique using this system. The 
aim of this randomised controlled trial was to determine which surgical 
technique results in better postoperative clinical outcomes after TKA using the 
contemporary Attune® Knee System: the measured resection or gap balancing 
technique.
METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted with 100 
patients undergoing TKA using measured resection (n = 50) or gap balancing 
(n = 50) technique. The measured femoral sizer was used in the measured 
resection group, while the balanced femoral sizer was used in the gap balancing 
group. Functional outcomes and quality of life were assessed preoperatively and 
at 6 months and 2 years post-surgery, using the Knee Society Function Score 
(KSFS), Knee Society Knee Score (KSKS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), the Physical 
Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) of Short-Form 36 (SF-36). 
Using weight-bearing coronal radiographs, the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), 
coronal femoral component angle (CFA), coronal tibial component angle (CTA) and 
joint line height were also evaluated for each patient.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the functional scores or the 
proportion of patients from each group who were satisfied or had their 
expectations fulfilled at 6 months or 2 years post-surgery. There was also no 
significant difference in the number of patients who attained minimum clinically 
important difference (MCID) postoperatively between the groups. Postoperatively, 
there was no significant difference in the number of HKA outliers between the 
groups (p = 0.202). The postoperative CFA (p = 0.265) and CTA (p = 0.479) were 
similar between the groups. There was also no significant difference in the 
absolute change (p = 0.447) or proportion of outliers (p = 0.611) for joint line 
height between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Both measured resection and gap balancing techniques resulted in 
comparable functional and quality of life outcomes up to 2 years post-surgery. 
Both techniques appear to be equally effective in achieving excellent outcomes 
with the Attune® Knee System.

Radical prostatectomy (RP), performed as an open, laparoscopic or robotic 
procedure, remains the "gold standard" for patients with localised prostate 
cancer who can be cured with surgery and have a life expectancy of at least 10 
years. Today, RP is also used as a first-line treatment for locally advanced 
prostate cancer, possibly in a multimodal setting with adjuvant 
radiation/hormonal therapy. The increasing experience of surgeons, better 
knowledge of anatomy and refinements of surgical techniques have greatly 
improved oncological and functional outcomes. In our article we would like to 
give an overview of the complications associated with this surgical procedure.

Publisher: Die radikale Prostatektomie (RP) als offener, laparoskopischer oder 
robotergestützter Eingriff stellt nach wie vor den kurativen „Goldstandard“ für 
Patienten mit einem lokal begrenzten Prostatakarzinom dar. Heutzutage wird die 
RP zudem als Erstbehandlung für ein lokal fortgeschrittenes Prostatakarzinom, 
eventuell im Rahmen eines multimodalen Settings mit adjuvanter 
Strahlen-/Hormontherapie angewendet. Die zunehmende Erfahrung der Chirurgen, die 
bessere Kenntnis der Anatomie und die Verfeinerungen der Operationstechniken 
haben die onkologischen sowie funktionellen Ergebnisse immens verbessert. In 
unserem Artikel möchten wir einen Überblick über die mit der Operation 
verbundenen Komplikationen geben.

Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the centrosomal pericentrin gene (PCNT) 
cause microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPDII), which 
is characterized by extreme growth retardation, microcephaly, skeletal 
dysplasia, and dental anomalies. Life expectancy is reduced due to a high risk 
of cerebral vascular anomalies. Here, we report two siblings with MOPDII and 
attenuated growth restriction, and pachygyria. Compound heterozygosity for two 
novel truncated PCNT variants was identified. Both truncated PCNT proteins were 
expressed in patient's fibroblasts, with a reduced total protein amount compared 
to control. Patient's fibroblasts showed impaired cell cycle progression. As a 
novel finding, 20% of patient's fibroblasts were shown to express PCNT 
comparable to control. This was associated with normal mitotic morphology and 
normal co-localization of mutated PCNT with centrosome-associated proteins 
γ-tubulin and centrin 3, suggesting some residual function of truncated PCNT 
proteins. These data expand the clinical and molecular spectrum of MOPDII and 
indicate that residual PCNT function might be associated with attenuated growth 
restriction in MOPDII.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the current 'gold standard' 
operation of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) compared to the new 
laser technique of thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate 
(ThuVARP) in men with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) within the UK National 
Health Service (NHS).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trial was conducted across seven UK centres (four 
university teaching hospitals and three district general hospitals). A total of 
410 men aged ≥18 years presenting with either bothersome lower urinary tract 
symptoms (LUTS) or urinary retention secondary to BPO, and suitable for surgery, 
were randomised (whilst under anaesthetic) 1:1 to receive the TURP or ThuVARP 
procedure. Resource use in relation to the operation, initial inpatient stay, 
and subsequent use of NHS services was collected for 12 months from 
randomisation (equivalent to primary effectiveness outcome) using hospital 
records and patient questionnaires. Resources were valued using UK reference 
costs. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the EuroQoL five 
Dimensions five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire completed at baseline, 3- and 
12-months. Total adjusted mean costs, QALYs and incremental Net Monetary Benefit 
statistics were calculated: cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and 
sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty.
RESULTS: The total adjusted mean secondary care cost over the 12 months in the 
TURP arm (£4244) was £9 (95% CI -£376, £359) lower than the ThuVARP arm (£4253). 
The ThuVARP operation took on average 21 min longer than TURP. The adjusted mean 
difference of QALYs (0.01 favouring TURP, 95% CI -0.01, 0.04) was similar 
between the arms. There is a 76% probability that TURP is the cost-effective 
option compared with ThuVARP at the £20 000 per QALY willingness to pay 
threshold used by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
CONCLUSION: One of the anticipated benefits of the laser surgery, reduced length 
of hospital stay with an associated reduction in cost, did not materialise 
within the study. The longer duration of the ThuVARP procedure is important to 
consider, both from a patient perspective in terms of increased time under 
anaesthetic, and from a service delivery perspective. TURP remains a highly 
cost-effective treatment for men with BPO.

OBJECTIVE: Colchicine prophylaxis to prevent gout flares when commencing 
urate-lowering therapy is recommended by international rheumatology society 
guidelines. Whether this is a cost-effective intervention is currently unknown. 
Our objective was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis using both a US cost 
input model and an Australian cost input model.
METHODS: This cost-effectiveness analysis was completed from the point of view 
of the third-party payer. We used a 2-arm decision tree with 1 arm commencing 
allopurinol with no colchicine prophylaxis and the other with colchicine 
prophylaxis. Model inputs were drawn from published literature where available. 
We completed a univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to confirm the 
robust nature of the modeling. The time frame for the model was 6 months.
RESULTS: The colchicine prophylaxis arm resulted in a cost of $1,276 and 0.49 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), while in the placebo arm the cost was $516 
and 0.47 QALYs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $34,004 per QALY 
gained. In Australia, where cost of colchicine was much lower, the colchicine 
arm dominated the placebo ($208 [Australian] in the colchicine arm versus $415 
[Australian] in the placebo). Univariate and probability sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that results were robust to changes in input parameters. In the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of colchicine prophylaxis 
being the most cost-effective option was 93% in the US and 100% in the 
Australian setting.
CONCLUSION: Colchicine prophylaxis to prevent gout flares while commencing 
allopurinol in gout is very cost-effective.

Patients with complex chronic lower extremity wounds require a great deal of 
interaction with outpatient and inpatient services. Paradoxically, these are the 
very patients that, because of their chronic comorbidities, are at greatest risk 
for COVID-related morbidity and mortality. Disinfected Phaenicia (Lucilia) 
sericata (Medical Maggots; Monarch Labs, Irvine, California) were applied in a 
standardised fashion by a home-health nurse with direct monitoring, guidance, 
and collaboration of the attending surgeon. A family member was able to change 
the outer dressing daily based on normal wound exudate. The inner maggot 
debridement therapy (MDT) dressing was changed at 2 days showing dramatic 
reduction in necrotic tissue, elimination of profound malodor, and no evidence 
of local or advancing infection. The entire initial telehealth-guided 
application took approximately 20 minutes. The first telehealth-guided MDT 
dressing change took 14 minutes. We used an artificial-intelligence-based 
algorithm to measure changes in wound characteristics. At day 0, 46% of the 
total surface area was covered in malodorous black, necrotic tissue. The first 
dressing change saw an elimination in assessed malodor with necrotic tissue 
constituting 14% of total surface area. The second dressing change at 5 days 
showed a greater than 99% reduction in necrotic tissue. This manuscript 
constitutes what we believe to be the first telehealth-guided MDT conducted 
during a resource-limited peri-pandemic period. We believe that MDT, which is an 
extension of efforts regularly performed in clinic and hospital, may have the 
potential to reduce resource usage while potentially improving care and quality 
of life for people with limb and life-threatening complications of diabetes and 
other chronic diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Numerous guidelines exist for the management of pancreatic cysts. 
We sought to compare the guideline-directed management strategies for pancreatic 
cysts by comparing 2 approaches (2017 International Consensus Guidelines and 
2015 American Gastroenterological Association Guidelines) that differ 
significantly in their thresholds for imaging, surveillance, and surgery.
METHODS: We developed a Monte Carlo model to evaluate the outcomes for a cohort 
of 10,000 patients managed per each guideline. The primary outcome was mortality 
related to pancreatic cyst management. Secondary outcomes included all-cause 
mortality, missed cancers, number of surgeries, number of imaging studies, 
cumulative cost, and quality-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: Deaths because of pancreatic cyst management and quality-adjusted life 
years were similar in both guidelines at a significantly higher cost of $3.6 
million per additional cancer detected in the Consensus Guidelines. Deaths from 
"unrelated" causes (1,422) vastly outnumbered deaths related to pancreatic cysts 
(125). Secondary outcomes included more missed cancers in the American 
Gastroenterological Association guideline (71 vs 49), more surgeries and imaging 
studies in the Consensus guideline (711 vs 163; 116,997 vs 68,912), and higher 
cost in the Consensus guideline ($168.3 million vs $89.4 million). As the rate 
of malignant transformation increases, a more-intensive guideline resulted in 
fewer deaths related to pancreatic cyst management.
DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates trade-offs between more- and less-intensive 
management strategies for pancreatic cysts. Although deaths related to 
pancreatic cyst management were similar in each strategy, fewer missed cancers 
in the more-intensive surveillance strategy is offset by a greater number of 
surgical deaths and higher cost. In conclusion, our study identifies that if the 
rate malignant transformation of pancreatic cysts is low (0.12% annually), a 
less-intensive guideline will result in similar deaths to a more-intensive 
guideline at a much lower cost.

OBJECTIVE: The menopausal transition has a negative effect on peripheral 
dilation in response to various stimuli including shear stress and exercise. 
Whether the presence of elevated traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
factors in women going through menopause exacerbates the adverse effect on 
peripheral vasodilation is unclear.
METHODS: Forty-four perimenopausal women with relatively low CVD risk were 
divided into tertiles based on atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) 10-year risk scores 
(lowest: 0.1%-0.5%, middle: 0.6%-0.9%, higher: >1%). Comparisons were made 
across tertile groups for the femoral artery vascular conductance (FVC) response 
to single-leg knee extension exercise (0, 5, 10, 15 W) as measured using Doppler 
ultrasound.
RESULTS: At higher exercise intensities, FVC was lower in women in the tertile 
group with the highest ASCVD 10-year risk scores (10 W: 6 ± 2 mL/min/mm Hg, 
15 W: 8 ± 3 mL/min/mm Hg) compared to women in the lowest tertile group (10 W: 
9 ± 3 mL/min/mm Hg, P = 0.01; 15 W: 12 ± 3 mL/min/mm Hg, P < 0.01) and middle 
tertile group (10 W: 10 ± 4 mL/min/mm Hg, P < 0.01; 15 W: 12 ± 5 mL/min/mm Hg, 
P < 0.01). The overall increase in FVC during exercise from 0 to 15 W remained 
lower (P ≤ 0.01) in women with the highest ASCVD risk scores compared to the 
other two tertile groups even after adjustment for chronological age, arterial 
stiffness, and fat-free mass adjusted aerobic fitness level.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the presence of mild differences in ASCVD risk 
scores may be associated with a blunted active limb blood flow during leg 
exercise in mid-life women transitioning through menopause.

IMPORTANCE: During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there may be too few 
ventilators to meet medical demands. It is unknown how many US states have 
ventilator allocation guidelines and how these state guidelines compare with one 
another.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the number of publicly available US state guidelines for 
ventilator allocation and the variation in state recommendations for how 
ventilator allocation decisions should occur and to assess whether unique 
criteria exist for pediatric patients.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: This systematic review evaluated publicly available guidelines 
about ventilator allocation for all states in the US and in the District of 
Columbia using department of health websites for each state and internet 
searches. Documents with any discussion of a process to triage mechanical 
ventilatory support during a public health emergency were screened for 
inclusion. Articles were excluded if they did not include specific ventilator 
allocation recommendations, were in draft status, did not include their state 
department of health, or were not the most up-to-date guideline. All documents 
were individually assessed and reassessed by 2 independent reviewers from March 
30 to April 2 and May 8 to 10, 2020.
FINDINGS: As of May 10, 2020, 26 states had publicly available ventilator 
guidelines, and 14 states had pediatric guidelines. Use of the Sequential Organ 
Failure Assessment score in the initial rank of adult patients was recommended 
in 15 state guidelines (58%), and assessment of limited life expectancy from 
underlying conditions or comorbidities was included in 6 state guidelines (23%). 
Priority was recommended for specific groups in the initial evaluation of 
patients in 6 states (23%) (ie, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Pennsylvania, and Utah). Many states recommended exclusion criteria in adult (11 
of 26 states [42%]) and pediatric (10 of 14 states [71%]) ventilator allocation. 
Withdrawal of mechanical ventilation from a patient to give to another if a 
shortage occurs was discussed in 22 of 26 adult guidelines (85%) and 9 of 14 
pediatric guidelines (64%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that although allocation 
guidelines for mechanical ventilatory support are essential in a public health 
emergency, only 26 US states provided public guidance on how this allocation 
should occur. Guidelines among states, including adjacent states, varied 
significantly and could cause inequity in the allocation of mechanical 
ventilatory support during a public health emergency, such as the coronavirus 
disease 2019 pandemic.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Theory of Mind (ToM) deficits are present in several 
mental disorders and closely related to problems in social functioning and lower 
quality of life. While several trainings are aimed at improving ToM performance, 
it is unknown whether positive expectations on a persons' ToM performance might 
cause better ToM achievement.
METHODS: Participants (n = 131) first completed a mock ToM test and were then 
randomly assigned to either receive standardized positive, negative or no 
feedback on their ToM performance. Secondly, their expectations on their own ToM 
performance were assessed. Thirdly, ToM was assessed using the Movie Task for 
the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC).
RESULTS: Participants who received positive feedback resulted in positive 
expectations on their ToM performance and showed enhanced ToM performance, 
whereas negative feedback did not lead to negative expectations and negative 
expectations did not affect a change in ToM performance.
LIMITATIONS: In the present exploratory study, the effect of positive 
expectations on ToM performance was assessed in a community sample. Thus, the 
study should be replicated in a clinical sample for more in-depth results.
CONCLUSIONS: ToM performance could be enhanced by inducing positive expectations 
on one's ToM performance, whereas negative feedback had no effect. The present 
study suggest that interventions that focus on strengthening positive 
expectations on one's ToM performance could enhance the efficacy of present ToM

OBJECTIVE: Ubiquitous computing has supported personalized health through a vast 
variety of wellness and healthcare self-quantification applications over the 
last decade. These applications provide insights for daily life activities but 
unable to portray the comprehensive impact of personal habits on human health. 
Therefore, in order to facilitate the individuals, we have correlated the 
lifestyle habits in an appropriate proportion to determine the overall impact of 
influenced behavior on the well-being of humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To study the combined impact of personal behaviors, we 
have proposed a methodology to derive the comprehensive Healthy Behavior Index 
(HBI) consisting of two major processes: (1) Behaviors' Weight-age 
Identification (BWI), and (2) Healthy Behavior Quantification and Index (HBQI) 
modeling. The BWI process identifies the high ranked contributing behaviors 
through life-expectancy based weight-age, whereas HBQI derives a mathematical 
model based on quantification and indexing of behavior using wellness 
guidelines.
RESULTS: The contributing behaviors are identified through text mining technique 
and verified by seven experts with a Kappa agreement level of 0.379. A 
real-world user-centric statistical evaluation is applied through User 
Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) method to evaluate the impact of HBI service. 
This HBI service is developed for the Mining Minds, a wellness management 
application. This study involves 103 registered participants (curious about the 
chronic disease) for a Korean wellness management organization. They used the 
HBI service over 12 weeks, the results for which were evaluated through UEQ and 
user feedback. The service reliability for the Cronbach's alpha coefficient 
greater than 0.7 was achieved using HBI service whereas the stimulation 
coefficient of the value 0.86 revealed significant effect. We observed an 
overall novelty of the value 0.88 showing the potential interest of 
participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive HBI has demonstrated positive user experience 
concerning the stimulation for adapting the healthy behaviors. The HBI service 
is designed independently to work as a service, so any other wellness management 
service-enabled platform can consume it to evaluate the healthy behavior index 
of the person for recommendation generation, behavior indication, and behavior 
adaptation.

This work examined the dependence of the health care waste generation rates 
(HCWGR) from economic factors (gross domestic product per capita, health 
expenditure per capita), social and health-related factors (human development 
index, life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling, deaths due to 
tuberculosis, under-five mortality rate, hospital beds, improved sanitation 
facilities, physicians, nurses and midwives, diabetes prevalence, deaths due to 
cancer, deaths due to asthma, deaths due to influenza and pneumonia), and one 
environmental sustainability factor (carbon dioxide emissions) from 41 countries 
using multiple linear regression modeling and principal component analysis 
(PCA). In addition, the Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for all 
pairwise comparisons and a geographical grouping of the HCWGR was performed. The 
examined HCWGR included both the hazardous and the municipal fraction of health 
care waste (HCW). Results showed that the CO2 emissions and the life expectancy 
at birth positively correlated to the HCWGR (kg/bed/d) and can be used as 
adequate statistical predictors. The resulting best reduced model explained 
84.7% of the variability. The hospital beds and the deaths due to cancer were 
not correlated to any principal component due to their low loadings. Only the 
diabetes prevalence was correlated to the F2 principal component. The other 
fourteen variables were correlated to the F1, which was the most significant 
principal component. Thus, the HCWGR and the other thirteen variables that were 
grouped to the F1 component have strong autocorrelation and can be treated as 
one variable.

Efforts to reduce insecticide inputs against plum curculio, Conotrachelus 
nenuphar, a key pest of apples in eastern North America, include perimeter-row 
insecticide sprays applied after the whole-orchard petal fall spray to manage 
dispersing adults and, more recently, insecticide sprays confined to odor-baited 
trap trees. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are virulent to ground-dwelling 
stages of C. nenuphar, and may be applied to the ground underneath trap-tree 
canopies. Here, we (1) compared the efficacy of the odor-baited trap tree 
approach with grower-prescribed (=grower standard) sprays to manage C. nenuphar 
populations over a six-year period in seven commercial apple orchards in New 
England; and (2) assessed the performance of the EPN Steinernema riobrave at 
suppressing ground-dwelling stages of C. nenuphar. In addition, the performance 
of S. riobrave was compared against that of S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae in one 
year. Across the six years, percent fruit injury on trap tree plots averaged 
11.3% on odor-baited trap trees and 1.4% on unbaited trees in grower standard 
plots, highlighting the ability of trap trees to aggregate C. nenuphar activity 
and subsequent injury. Mean percentage injury on fruit sampled from interior 
trees, the strongest measure of treatment performance, in trap tree plots did 
not differ significantly from that recorded on interior trees in grower standard 
spray plots (0.95 vs. 0.68%, respectively). Steinernema riobrave consistently 
reduced C. nenuphar populations as indicated by the significantly lower number 
of adult C. nenuphar that emerged from the soil, when compared to water control. 
Steinernema carpocapsae and S. riobrave performed similarly well, and both EPN 
species outperformed S. feltiae. Our combined findings indicate that an IPM 
approach that targets multiple life stages of C. nenuphar has the potential to 
manage this pest more sustainably in a reduced-spray environment.

INTRODUCTION: This study is one of the first real-world cost-effectiveness 
analyses of one-year adjuvant trastuzumab used in HER2-positive early female 
breast cancer in comparison to chemotherapy alone. It is just the second one in 
Europe, the first one in Cyprus, and the fourth one worldwide ever carried out 
using real-world data.
METHODS: Using a Markov model (four health states), a cost-effectiveness 
analysis was carried out both over 20 years and for a lifetime horizon. The 
sampling method used in this study was the randomized sampling of 900 women.
RESULTS: The findings for the 20-year horizon showed that all trastuzumab arms 
were more cost-effective, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of only €60,000 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) [incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICER): €40,436.10/QALY]. For the lifetime horizon, with thresholds of €20,000, 
€40,000, and €60,000/QALY, all trastuzumab arms were found to be more 
cost-effective (ICER: €17,753.85/QALY). Moreover, for the 20-year and the 
lifetime horizons, with thresholds of €20,000/QALY, €40,000/QALY, and 
€60,000/QALY, the most cost-effective of the three subgroups (anthracyclines and 
then trastuzumab, no anthracyclines and then trastuzumab, and anthracyclines, 
taxanes, and trastuzumab) was that of anthracyclines and then trastuzumab (ICER: 
€18,301.55/QALY and €8954.97/QALY, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that adjuvant trastuzumab for one year in female 
HER2-positive early breast cancer can be considered cost-effective.

Cancer is considered one of the most threatening diseases worldwide. Although 
many therapeutic approaches have been developed and optimized for ameliorating 
patient's conditions and life expectancy, however, it frequently remains an 
incurable pathology. Notably, conventional treatments may reveal inefficient in 
the presence of metastasis development, multidrug resistance and inability to 
achieve targeted drug delivery. In the last decades, nanomedicine has gained a 
prominent role, due to many properties ascribable to nanomaterials. It is worth 
mentioning their small size, their ability to be loaded with small drugs and 
bioactive molecules and the possibility to be functionalized for tumor 
targeting. Natural vehicles have been exploited, such as exosomes, and designed, 
such as liposomes. Biomimetic nanomaterials have been engineered, by 
modification with biological membrane coating. Several nanoparticles have 
already entered clinical trials and some liposomal formulations have been 
approved for therapeutic applications. In this review, natural and synthetic 
nanocarriers functionalized for actively targeting cancer cells will be 
described, focusing on their advantages with respect to conventional treatments. 
Recent innovations related to biomimetic nanoparticles camouflaged with 
membranes isolated from different types of cells will be reported, together with 
their promising applications. Finally, a short overview on the latest advances 
in carrier-free nanomaterials will be provided.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer has a high impact on both patients and relatives due to 
the high disease burden and short life expectancy. Previous studies looked into 
treatment goals patients have before starting a systemic treatment. However, 
studies on relatives' perceptions of treatment at the end of life are scarce. 
Therefore, we studied the perspectives of relatives in hindsight on the 
achievement of treatment goals and the choice to start treatment for metastatic 
lung cancer of their loved one.
METHODS: We conducted a structured telephone interview study in six hospitals 
across the Netherlands, one academic and five non-academic hospitals, between 
February 2017 and November 2019. We included 118 relatives of deceased patients 
diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer who started a systemic treatment as part 
of usual care (chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapy with tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and who completed a questionnaire on their treatment 
goals before the start of treatment and when treatment was finished. We asked 
the relatives about the achievement of patients' treatment goals and relatives' 
satisfaction with the choice to start treatment. This study is part of a larger 
study in which 266 patients with metastatic lung cancer participated who started 
a systemic treatment and reported their treatment goals before start of the 
treatment and the achievement of these goals after the treatment.
RESULTS: Relatives reported the goals 'quality of life', 'decrease tumour size' 
and 'life prolongation' as achieved in 21, 37 and 41% respectively. The majority 
of the relatives (78%) were satisfied with the choice to start a treatment and 
even when none of the goals were achieved, 70% of the relatives were satisfied. 
About 50% of relatives who were satisfied with the patients' choice mentioned 
negative aspects of the treatment choice, such as the treatment did not work, 
there were side effects or it would not have been the relatives' choice. 
Whereas, 80% of relatives who were not satisfied mentioned negative aspects of 
the treatment choice. The most mentioned positive aspects were that they tried 
everything and that it was the patient's choice.
CONCLUSION: The majority of relatives reported patients' treatment goals as not 
achieved. However, relatives were predominantly satisfied about the treatment 
choice. Satisfaction does not provide a full picture of the experience with the 
treatment decision considering that the majority of relatives mentioned (also) 
negative aspects of this decision. At the time of making the treatment decision 
it is important to manage expectations about the chance of success and the 
possible side effects of the treatment.

Pathogenic bacteria acquire the acquisition of iron from the host to ensure 
their survival. Salmonella spp. utilizes siderophores, including salmochelin, 
for high affinity aggressive import of iron. Although the iroBCDEN operon is 
reportedly responsible for the production and the transport of salmochelin, the 
molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of its gene expression have not 
yet been characterized. Here, we analyzed the expression pattern of iroB using 
the lacZY transcriptional reporter system and determined the transcription start 
site in response to iron availability using primer extension analysis. We 
further examined the regulation of iroB expression by the ferric uptake 
regulator (Fur), a key regulatory protein involved in the maintenance of iron 
homeostasis in various bacteria, including Salmonella. Using sequence analysis 
followed by a gel shift assay, we verified that the Fur box lies within the 
promoter region of iroBCDE. The Fur box contained the consensus sequence 
(GATATTGGTAATTATTATC) and overlapped with the -10-element region. The expression 
of iroB was repressed by Fur in the presence of iron, as determined using an 
in vitro transcription assay. Therefore, we found that the iron acquisition 
system is regulated in a Fur-dependent manner in Salmonella.

Randomized clinical trials are essential for determining the efficacy of 
interventions, but have limitations. The types of limitations discussed in this 
review may be grouped in 11 categories including incorrect statistical 
inference, low internal or external validity, misinterpretation of the 
difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistical approaches, publication 
bias, that healthy persons with a given condition participate in clinical trials 
although they are not representative of the population as a whole, the rather 
short duration (3 to 5 years) that does not give correct estimates of the 
lifetime effects of the interventions or the legacy effect when participants who 
receive active therapy derive residual benefit after the end of the study when 
all participants receive active medication and the tension between the 
generalizability of the evidence versus the reliability of the findings of 
different types of clinical trials and the difficulty in applying the findings 
of randomized clinical trials to individual patients. These limitations are 
described and illustrated by examples and figures from the literature. In 
conclusion, this review will be useful to clinical trialists, clinical trial 
participants and regulatory agents.
