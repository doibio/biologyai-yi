Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: La baja frecuencia de casos y muertes por el virus 
SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 en algunos países de África llamó nuestra atención sobre el 
comportamiento inusual de esta enfermedad. La ivermectina se considera un 
fármaco de elección para diversas enfermedades parasitarias y virales, y se ha 
demostrado que tiene efectos in vitro contra el SARS-CoV-2.
OBJETIVOS: Nuestro estudio tiene el objetivo describir las tasas de infección y 
mortalidad del SARS-CoV-2 en los países africanos que participaron en una 
campaña intensiva masiva de ivermectina para el control de la oncocercosis y 
compararlas con las de los países que no participaron.
MÉTODOS: Los datos de 19 países que participaron en el Programa Africano para el 
Control de la Oncocercosis (APOC) patrocinado por la Organización Mundial de la 
Salud (OMS), desde 1995 hasta 2015, se compararon con 35 países que no fueron 
incluidos (NO APOC). La información sobre casos y muertes por COVID-19 se obtuvo 
de la base de datos https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. Se utilizaron 
modelos de regresión de Poisson para obtener estimaciones del efecto del estado 
APOC sobre las tasas acumuladas de infección y mortalidad por SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTADOS: Después de controlar diferentes factores, incluido el Índice de 
Desarrollo Humano (IDH), los países APOC (frente a los no APOC) mostraron una 
mortalidad 28% menor (razón de tasas ajustada: RR= 0.72, IC 95%: 0.67-0.78) y 
una tasa de infección 8% menor (RR= 0.92, IC 95%: 0.91-0.93) por COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONES: Las tasas de mortalidad e infección son significativamente más 
bajas en países APOC en comparación con los países no APOC. Una campaña 
preventiva masiva de salud pública contra el COVID-19 pudo haber tenido lugar 
inadvertidamente en algunos países africanos con un uso masivo de ivermectina en 
la comunidad es una hipótesis atractiva. Se necesitan estudios adicionales para 
confirmarlo.

Germany has set itself the goal of reducing the premature mortality of under 
70-year-old men to 190/100,000 and of women to 100/100,000 (age-standardized) by 
2030. This is in line with the targets of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG) (2015-2030) to reduce premature mortality by 34% for 
both men and women during this period. For the years 2010 to 2018, the premature 
mortality of 0-69-year-old men and women was calculated and standardized to the 
European population. On this basis, two linear trend calculations were made and 
compared with each other: 1. with the data of the target for Germany up to the 
year 2030, and 2. with the real figures achieved so far. The goal of reducing 
premature mortality by 34% within 15 years can, according to the current trend, 
only be achieved to 13.5% for men and 5.2% for women. Conclusions will be drawn 
from this as to how premature mortality can be reduced more significantly.

Publisher: Deutschland hat sich das Ziel gesetzt, die vorzeitige Sterblichkeit 
der unter 70-jährigen Männer auf 190/100.000 und der Frauen auf 100/100.000 
(altersstandardisiert) bis zum Jahr 2030 zu senken. Das entspricht den 
Zielstellungen der Nachhaltigen Entwicklungsziele (SDG) der Vereinten Nationen 
(UN) (2015–2030), die vorzeitige Sterblichkeit in diesem Zeitraum um 34% für 
Männer und Frauen zu senken.Für die Jahre 2010 bis 2018 wurde die vorzeitige 
Sterblichkeit der unter 70-jährigen Männer und Frauen berechnet und auf die 
Europa-Bevölkerung standardisiert. Auf dieser Grundlage wurden zwei lineare 
Trendberechnungen vorgenommen und miteinander verglichen: 1. Mit den Daten der 
Zielstellung für Deutschland bis zum Jahr 2030 und 2. mit den bisher real 
erreichten Zahlen.Das Ziel, die vorzeitige Mortalität um 34% innerhalb von 15 
Jahren zu senken, kann nach dem gegenwärtigen Trend nur bis 13,5% für Männer und 
bis 5,2% für Frauen erreicht werden. Daraus werden Schlussfolgerungen 
abgeleitet, wie die vorzeitige Sterblichkeit stärker abgesenkt werden kann.

Neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases are a major public health 
problem worldwide, especially with the increase of life-expectancy observed 
during the last decades. For many of these diseases, we still lack a full 
understanding of their etiology and pathophysiology. Nonetheless their 
association with mitochondrial dysfunction highlights this organelle as an 
important player during CNS homeostasis and disease. Markers of Parkinson (PD) 
and Alzheimer (AD) diseases are able to induce innate immune pathways induced by 
alterations in mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis leading to neuroinflammation. 
Additionally, exacerbated type I IFN responses triggered by mitochondrial DNA 
(mtDNA), failures in mitophagy, ER-mitochondria communication and mtROS 
production promote neurodegeneration. On the other hand, regulation of 
mitochondrial dynamics is essential for CNS health maintenance and leading to 
the induction of IL-10 and reduction of TNF-α secretion, increased cell 
viability and diminished cell injury in addition to reduced oxidative stress. 
Thus, although previously solely seen as power suppliers to organelles and 
molecular processes, it is now well established that mitochondria have many 
other important roles, including during immune responses. Here, we discuss the 
importance of these mitochondrial dynamics during neuroinflammation, and how 
they correlate either with the amelioration or worsening of CNS disease.

AIMS: Long-term data on TNFi treatment in patients with axSpA is scarce. The 
objective of this analysis was to assess long-term clinical efficacy of 
etanercept in early axSpA [including both non-radiographic and radiographic 
axSpA forms], who participated in the long-term (until year 10) extension of the 
ESTHER-trial.
METHODS: In the previously reported ESTHER-trial, patients with early active 
axSpA were randomized to treatment with etanercept (n = 40) or sulfasalazine 
(n = 36) during the first year. Patients in remission discontinued their therapy 
and were followed up until the end of year 2; in case of remission-loss, 
etanercept was (re)-introduced and continued until the end of year 10. If 
remission was not achieved at year 1, patients continued receiving (or were 
switched to) etanercept for up to 10 years.
RESULTS: A total of 19 patients (12 with r-axSpA and 7 with nr-axSpA at 
baseline) out of the initial 76 patients (= 25%) completed year 10 of the study. 
In the entire group, a sustained clinical response was seen over 10 years of 
follow up in the as-observed analysis. Completers were significantly more often 
male and showed lower values of patient and physician global assessments of 
disease activity, Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), and 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life questionnaire (ASQoL) scores at baseline 
as compared with non-completers. When analyzing clinical data of the completers, 
mean Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Bath 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) values were constantly below 2 
and mean ASDAS below 2.1 during follow up with no statistically significant 
differences between the r-axSpA and nr-axSpA subgroups. A total of 39 serious 
adverse events were documented over the 10 years, while six of them were seen as 
possibly associated with the etanercept treatment, which led in five patients to 
treatment discontinuation.
CONCLUSION: A sustained clinical response was observed over the 10 years of the 
study with comparable response and drop-out rates between r-axSpA and nr-axSpA. 
Etanercept was well tolerated across the entire treatment period and showed a 
good safety profile with no new safety signals.

BACKGROUND: People with schizophrenia have a 15-20-year reduction in life 
expectancy, driven in part by the metabolic effects of antipsychotics. Clozapine 
is associated with the highest rates of weight gain. As clozapine remains the 
most effective antipsychotic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), 
identifying treatments to ameliorate clozapine-induced weight gain (CIWG) is 
urgently needed to reduce this morality gap.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed digital health records of patients with TRS 
aged 18-65 newly initiated on clozapine at four tertiary hospitals in south-east 
Queensland from 1 March 2017 to 30 June 2019. Our primary outcome was the effect 
of metformin on change in percentage bodyweight at 12 months after clozapine 
initiation, with secondary outcome being proportion with >5% or >7% bodyweight 
change. We also explored impact on bodyweight change of other variables 
including sex, tobacco smoking, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), age, clozapine level and 
dose and clozapine/norclozapine ratio.
RESULTS: Among 90 patients initiated on clozapine, metformin use (n = 48) was 
associated with a smaller increase in percentage bodyweight (1.32% versus 5.95%, 
p = 0.031), lower rates of >7% gain in bodyweight (37.8% versus 63.0%, 
p = 0.025) but not >5% gain in bodyweight. Age below the median (32.0 years) was 
associated with greater bodyweight gain (5.55% versus 1.22%, p = 0.046). Sex, 
tobacco smoking, T2DM, clozapine dose and level and clozapine/norclozapine ratio 
were not associated with differences in change in bodyweight.
CONCLUSION: In this small retrospective cohort study, use of metformin within 
12-months of clozapine initiation was associated with a statistically and 
clinically significant reduction in CIWG. Although there is increasing evidence 
for the role of metformin to ameliorate bodyweight gain at time of clozapine 
initiation, our findings need replication and testing in a randomised controlled 
trial before recommending metformin co-commencement with clozapine as standard 
clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: We are trying to create a platform for social innovation to extend 
life span.
METHODS: Since 2005, health data (approximately 3000 items per person as of 
2020) of approximately 1000 adults have been collected each year during the 
Iwaki Health Promotion Project. The industry, government, academia, and citizens 
have involvements in data collection, aiming to build a platform that encourages 
societal innovation and subsequently extends life expectancy in Aomori. The 
Iwaki Health Promotion Project has been supported financially by the Japanese 
government since it was selected as the Center of Innovation program in 2013.
RESULTS: Since the numbers of academia, industries, governments, and citizens 
involved in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project increased over the years, the big 
data produced during the project has become increasingly pluripotent and 
adaptable. It has been used to promote public health, which has also created a 
stronger partnership among companies and research organizations. Consequently, 
the amount of data collected from the project has gained attention and became 
more open to companies and researchers participating in the Iwaki Health 
Promotion Project, resulted in establishing a larger platform. It also led to 
the acquisition of external funding, publications of numerous research papers, 
creation of new health examinations, and the establishment of the Health 
Promotion Center (an institution for cultivating health volunteers).
CONCLUSION: The Iwaki Health Promotion Project aims not only to produce a 
pluripotent big data but also to improve the average life expectancy of Aomori 
by creating a large platform in the society. Its positive impact in the future 
is infinite and will keep growing as long as it is maintained by the society.

Immunotherapy-Resistant Vitreoretinal Metastatic Melanoma.

Venkat A(1), Binkley EM(1), Srivastava S(1), Karthik N(1), Singh AD(1).

Author information:
(1)Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

PURPOSE: To describe 2 cases of vitreoretinal metastases in patients treated 
with immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma.
METHODS: Retrospective case series.
RESULTS: We pre-sent 2 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with systemic 
immunotherapy with subsequent development of ocular vitreoretinal metastasis. 
The first patient was a male with metastatic melanoma from a site of unknown 
origin that was in complete remission following a course of ipilimumab and 
nivolumab therapy. He presented to an outside provider for evaluation of 
vitritis and a pigmented lesion in the right eye that was presumed secondary to 
toxoplasmosis. After failing initial management with oral antibiotics, he 
underwent diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy, and vitreous biopsy was consistent 
with metastatic melanoma to the vitreous. He was additionally found to have an 
elevated pigmented retinal mass consistent with a retinal metastasis from 
melanoma that initially failed treatment with plaque brachytherapy and 
ultimately required enucleation. The second case was a monocular male with 
metastatic melanoma from cutaneous melanoma with decreased vision 3 months after 
the initiation of nivolumab therapy. He presented with dense vitreous debris in 
his seeing eye and was thought to have nivolumab-associated inflammation. He was 
initially treated with difluprednate with improved vision and decrease in 
vitreous debris, but developed dense pigment deposition in the affected eye 
later in the treatment course. Diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy was performed, 
and vitreous biopsy was positive for malignant melanoma cells. His systemic 
disease was in remission at the time of diagnosis of ocular metastasis. External 
beam radiation was recommended given his monocular status.
CONCLUSION: Vitreoretinal metastasis can develop despite favorable systemic 
response to immunotherapy in patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Lack 
of ocular penetration and extension of life span with immunotherapeutic agents 
may be the underlying mechanism for vitreoretinal metastasis.

Increased expression of Polδ does not alter the canonical replication program in 
vivo.

Zach R(1), Carr AM(1).

Road, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, BN1 9RQ, UK.

Background: In vitro experiments utilising the reconstituted Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae eukaryotic replisome indicated that the efficiency of the leading 
strand replication is impaired by a moderate increase in Polδ concentration. It 
was hypothesised that the slower rate of the leading strand synthesis 
characteristic for reactions containing two-fold and four-fold increased 
concentration of Polδ represented a consequence of a relatively rare event, 
during which Polδ stochastically outcompeted Polε and, in an inefficient manner, 
temporarily facilitated extension of the leading strand. Inspired by this 
observation, we aimed to determine whether similarly increased Polδ levels 
influence replication dynamics in vivo using the fission yeast 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model system. Methods: To generate S. pombe 
strains over-expressing Polδ, we utilised Cre-Lox mediated cassette exchange and 
integrated one or three extra genomic copies of all four Polδ genes. To estimate 
expression of respective Polδ genes in Polδ-overexpressing mutants, we measured 
relative transcript levels of cdc1 + , cdc6 + (or cdc6 L591G ), cdc27 + and cdm1 
+ by reverse transcription followed by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). To assess the 
impact of Polδ over-expression on cell physiology and replication dynamics, we 
used standard cell biology techniques and polymerase usage sequencing. Results: 
We provide an evidence that two-fold and four-fold over-production of Polδ does 
not significantly alter growth rate, cellular morphology and S-phase duration. 
Polymerase usage sequencing analysis further indicates that increased Polδ 
expression does not change activities of Polδ, Polε and Polα at replication 
initiation sites and across replication termination zones. Additionally, we show 
that mutants over-expressing Polδ preserve WT-like distribution of replication 
origin efficiencies. Conclusions: Our experiments do not disprove the existence 
of opportunistic polymerase switches; however, the data indicate that, if 
stochastic replacement of Polε for Polδ does occur i n vivo, it represents a 
rare phenomenon that does not significantly influence canonical replication 
program.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss changes in female demographic parameters in the US 
and associated increase in utilization of fertility services.
RECENT FINDINGS: Fractions of women earning bachelor's, master's, and doctoral 
degrees increased from 1970 to 2018 (32.6 vs 64.8; 7.9 vs 27.3; 0.54 vs 5.7 per 
10,000 women; P < .001; respectively). This was associated with decrease in 
percentage of married women (61.9% vs 50.8%) and increase in median age at first 
marriage (20.8 vs 27.8). In parallel, mean age of mothers at first birth 
increased (21.4 vs 26.8), and pregnancy rates of women aged 35-39 and 
40-44 years doubled between 1980 and 2010 (0.036 vs 0.077; 0.009 vs 0.019 per 
1,000 women). With later pregnancy attempts, female fertility rates decreased 
from 1970 to 2017 (87.9% vs 60.3%; P < .001). Women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technologies (ART) treatment with a DOR diagnosis increased (12% vs 
31%), and ART cycles using donor eggs increased (16,161 vs 24,300), between 2005 
and 2016.
SUMMARY: Participation of women in education is paralleled by increased female 
employment, later occurrence of marriage, increased age of childbearing, 
decreased fertility rates, and increased DOR diagnosis.

The increase in life expectancy and the migration of individuals with Chagas 
disease (ChD) from rural to urban centers exposes them to the development of 
chronic-degenerative abnormalities that may increase the prevalence of metabolic 
syndrome (MetS). The present study aimed to identify the prevalence of MetS and 
its components in individuals with chronic ChD. This is a cross-sectional study 
with 361 patients of both sexes, aging >18 years, followed at a national 
reference center (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). MetS diagnosis followed the 
International Diabetes Federation 2005 criteria. The association between the 
variables was determined through logistic regression models. The mean age was 
and 60.7±10.8 years. About half (56.2%) were female and the majority 
self-reported their race as mulatto (59.8%). The percentage of individuals with 
MetS was 40.4%. The variables independently associated with MetS were age (OR 
1.06; 95%CI 1.04-1.09), high education levels (OR 0.36; 95%CI 0.17-0.79) and 
cardiac form with heart failure (OR 0.34; 95%CI 0.17-0.68). Therefore, a high 
prevalence of MetS was found in this Brazilian chronic ChD cohort. The 
identification of the associated factors can facilitate the development of 
effective approaches for preventing and managing MetS in ChD patients.

BACKGROUND: Opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy or as an 
alternative to bilateral tubal ligation may reduce the incidence of ovarian 
cancer, because it has been demonstrated that most serous ovarian cancers begin 
in the fallopian tubes. However, salpingectomy at the time of sterilization is 
not always financially covered by third-party payers, and this represents a 
barrier to adoption. Routine salpingectomy has become more common but is not 
always practiced at the time of hysterectomy.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the impact of opportunistic 
salpingectomy as an alternative tubal ligation and routine salpingectomy at the 
time of hysterectomy on ovarian cancer mortality and overall cost.
STUDY DESIGN: An 8-state Markov state transition model was constructed, 
including hysterectomy, tubal ligation, and ovarian cancer. Transition 
probabilities were informed by previously reported population data and include 
age-adjusted rates of elective sterilization and hysterectomy. This model was 
used to predict ovarian cancer incidence and the cost effectiveness of 
opportunistic salpingectomy. Testing of this model suggested that it accurately 
predicted overall life expectancy and closely predicted the rate of hysterectomy 
in the population. The model may underestimate the rate of tubal sterilization, 
making it conservative with respect to the benefits of salpingectomy.
RESULTS: The recursive Markov model was run from ages 20 to 85 years in 1-year 
intervals with a half step correction and included age-adjusted rates of tubal 
ligation, hysterectomy (with and without oophorectomy), and ovarian cancer. The 
model predicts that opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of tubal ligation 
will reduce ovarian cancer mortality by 8.13%. Opportunistic salpingectomy at 
the time of hysterectomy will reduce ovarian cancer mortality by 6.34% for a 
combined decrease of 14.5%. Both strategies are cost effective when considering 
only the cost of the opportunistic salpingectomy. The excess cost of 
opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of tubal ligation was $433.91 with an 
incremental cost-effective ratio of $6401 per life-year and $5469 per 
quality-adjusted life year gained when adjusting for ovarian cancer with a 
utility of 0.64. The incremental cost-effective ratio for opportunistic 
salpingectomy during hysterectomy at a cost of $124.70 was $2006 per life-year 
and $1667 per quality-adjusted life year. When considering the impact of ovarian 
cancer prevention with respect to the cost of ovarian cancer treatment, 
opportunistic salpingectomy may produce a substantial healthcare savings. 
Utilizing a 3% discount rate, it is estimated that the total savings for 
universal salpingectomy could be as high as $445 million annually in the United 
States. A sensitivity analysis around the benefit of opportunistic salpingectomy 
suggests that this procedure will be cost effective even if salpingectomy 
provides only a modest reduction in the risk of ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSION: It is estimated that universal opportunistic salpingectomy may 
prevent 1854 deaths per year from ovarian cancer and may reduce healthcare 
costs. Given these data, universal opportunistic salpingectomy should be 
considered at the time of tubal ligation and hysterectomy and covered by 
third-party payers.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is currently one of the most common chronic diseases. 
As life expectancy increases, its prevalence and incidence are expected to rise. 
At present, more and more evidences prove the correlation between the complement 
system and osteoarthritis (OA). This study aims to investigate complement C5's 
influence on the effect of MK801 on osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts 
(OA-SFs).
METHODS: We used IL-1b to induce OA-SFs derived from mice to obtain OA-SFs. And 
we performed RT-PCR and Western Blot assays to evaluate the expression levels of 
associated mRNA and protein. The alteration of MAC expression on OA-SFs cell 
membrane was evaluated by immunofluorescence assay. The expression of related 
inflammatory factors of OA-SFs was evaluated by ELISA experiment.
RESULTS: MK801 could significantly inhibit the expression of osteoarthritis (OA) 
marker factors, such as: membrane attack complex (MAC), tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α) and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13). Meanwhile, MK801 can 
significantly inhibit the expression of complement C5 (C5) in OA-SFs. 
Immunofluorescence assay showed that MAC expression on OA-SFs cell membrane was 
significantly inhibited by MK801. The nucleo-plasmic separation experiment 
demonstrated that MK801 could significantly inhibit the activation of Nuclear 
factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in OA-SFs. Futhermore, koncking down the 
expression of C5 reversed the inhibition MK801 on the expression of OA-SFs 
inflammatory factors.
CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrated two points: first, MK801 inhibited the 
generation of MAC and the release of inflammation factors in OA-SFs through C5; 
second: MK801 inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in OA-SFs.

The human zinc transporter ZnT8 provides the granules of pancreatic β-cells with 
zinc (II) ions for assembly of insulin hexamers for storage. Until recently, the 
structure and function of human ZnTs have been modelled on the basis of the 3D 
structures of bacterial zinc exporters, which form homodimers with each monomer 
having six transmembrane α-helices harbouring the zinc transport site and a 
cytosolic domain with an α,β structure and additional zinc-binding sites. 
However, there are important differences in function as the bacterial proteins 
export an excess of zinc ions from the bacterial cytoplasm, whereas ZnT8 exports 
zinc ions into subcellular vesicles when there is no apparent excess of 
cytosolic zinc ions. Indeed, recent structural investigations of human ZnT8 show 
differences in metal binding in the cytosolic domain when compared to the 
bacterial proteins. Two common variants, one with tryptophan (W) and the other 
with arginine (R) at position 325, have generated considerable interest as the 
R-variant is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Since 
the mutation is at the apex of the cytosolic domain facing towards the cytosol, 
it is not clear how it can affect zinc transport through the transmembrane 
domain. We expressed the cytosolic domain of both variants of human ZnT8 and 
have begun structural and functional studies. We found that (i) the metal 
binding of the human protein is different from that of the bacterial proteins, 
(ii) the human protein has a C-terminal extension with three cysteine residues 
that bind a zinc(II) ion, and (iii) there are small differences in stability 
between the two variants. In this investigation, we employed nickel(II) ions as 
a probe for the spectroscopically silent Zn(II) ions and utilised colorimetric 
and fluorimetric indicators for Ni(II) ions to investigate metal binding. We 
established Ni(II) coordination to the C-terminal cysteines and found 
differences in metal affinity and coordination in the two ZnT8 variants. These 
structural differences are thought to be critical for the functional differences 
regarding the diabetes risk. Further insight into the assembly of the metal 
centres in the cytosolic domain was gained from potentiometric investigations of 
zinc binding to synthetic peptides corresponding to N-terminal and C-terminal 
sequences of ZnT8 bearing the metal-coordinating ligands. Our work suggests the 
involvement of the C-terminal cysteines, which are part of the cytosolic domain, 
in a metal chelation and/or acquisition mechanism and, as now supported by the 
high-resolution structural work, provides the first example of metal-thiolate 
coordination chemistry in zinc transporters.

Pre-Weaning Morbidity and Mortality, and Performance of Dairy Calves in a Large 
Dairy Herd.

Failure of transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) due to inadequate ingestion of 
colostral immunoglobulins by calves is associated with increased mortality and 
morbidity risks. Feeding calves a sufficient amount of quality-tested colostrum 
within the first hours of life is essential for successfully transferring 
passive immunity. Many farms have implemented a second meal of colostrum to 
maximize the opportunities for passive immunity transfer. However, excellent 
passive immunity can be achieved with a single feeding of sufficient 
quality-tested colostrum. Moreover, there is currently no evidence demonstrating 
the impact of a second colostrum feeding within 24 h of life in calves receiving 
adequate volumes of quality-tested colostrum in an initial feeding. Hence, the 
objective of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the risks of FPTI, 
pre-weaning morbidity and mortality, and growth and performance between dairy 
calves that received one or two feedings of colostrum. For this, the health and 
production records of a large dairy herd were analyzed. At this farm, newborn 
calves receive 3 L of quality-tested colostrum soon after birth, followed by 
another 2 L 5-6 h later. However, at times of shortages of colostrum, calves 
only receive the initial 3 L meal. The records of 2064 male and 2272 female 
calves were analyzed, where 4156 and 180 calves received 2 and 1 colostrum 
meals, respectively. Data from both sexes were included in the analysis of the 
risks of FTPI, morbidity, and mortality; however, only data from heifer calves 
were utilized for growth and performance analysis. Survival analysis, and 
logistic and linear regression models were used to investigate the impact of 
receiving two feedings of colostrum on calf FTPI status, morbidity, mortality, 
reproductive indices, pre-weaning average daily gain (ADG), and first lactation 
305-d Mature Equivalent milk production (305ME). Calves that received two 
feedings of colostrum had lower odds of FTPI, a lower probability of being 
treated for respiratory disease, diarrhea, or any disease, and a greater 
pre-weaning ADG. However, there was no association between the number of 
colostrum feedings and pre-weaning mortality, and the probabilities of first 
insemination and first calving, although heifers receiving two colostrum 
feedings tended to receive fewer inseminations and to have a greater first 
lactation 305ME. Collectively, our results suggest that feeding calves a second 
feeding of colostrum 5-6 h after the initial feeding soon after birth could be 
an effective strategy to decrease FTPI and morbidity and optimize ADG in dairy 
calves pre-weaning.

Molecular target therapies have markedly improved the survival of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, especially those with epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) mutations. A positive EGFR mutation is even more critical when 
the chronicity of spinal metastasis is considered. However, most prognostic 
models that estimate the life expectancy of spinal metastasis patients do not 
include these biological factors. We retrospectively reviewed 85 consecutive 
NSCLC patients who underwent palliative surgical treatment for spinal metastases 
to evaluate the following: (1) the prognostic value of positive EGFR mutation 
and the chronicity of spinal metastasis, and (2) the clinical significance of 
adding these two factors to an existing prognostic model, namely the New England 
Spinal Metastasis Score (NESMS). Among 85 patients, 38 (44.7%) were EGFR 
mutation-positive. Spinal metastasis presented as the initial manifestation of 
malignancy in 58 (68.2%) patients. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
model showed that the chronicity of spinal metastasis (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.88, 
p = 0.015) and EGFR mutation positivity (HR = 2.10, p = 0.002) were 
significantly associated with postoperative survival. The Uno's C-index and 
time-dependent AUC 6 months following surgery significantly increased when these 
factors were added to NESMS (p = 0.004 and p = 0.022, respectively). In 
conclusion, biological factors provide an additional prognostic value for NSCLC 
patients with spinal metastasis.

In a prospective study, we sought to determine acceptability of linkage of 
administrative and clinical trial data among Canadian patients and Research 
Ethics Boards (REBs). The goal is to develop a more harmonized approach to data, 
with potential to improve clinical trial conduct through enhanced data quality 
collected at reduced cost and inconvenience for patients. On completion of the 
original LY.12 randomized clinical trial in lymphoma (NCT00078949), participants 
were invited to enrol in the Long-term Innovative Follow-up Extension (LIFE) 
component. Those consenting to do so provided comprehensive identifying 
information to facilitate linkage with their administrative data. We 
prospectively designed a global assessment of this innovative approach to 
clinical trial follow-up including rates of REB approval and patient consent. 
The pre-specified benchmark for patient acceptability was 80%. Of 16 REBs who 
reviewed the research protocol, 14 (89%) provided approval; two in Quebec 
declined due to small patient numbers. Of 140 patients invited to participate, 
115 (82%, 95% CI 76 to 88%) from across 9 Canadian provinces provided consent 
and their full name, date of birth, health insurance number and postal code to 
facilitate linkage with their administrative data for long-term follow-up. 
Linkage of clinical trial and administrative data is feasible and acceptable. 
Further collaborative work including many stakeholders is required to develop an 
optimized secure approach to research. A more coordinated national approach to 
health data could facilitate more rapid testing and identification of new 
effective treatments across multiple jurisdictions and diseases from diabetes to 
COVID-19.

Over the past century, we have witnessed an increase in life-expectancy due to 
public health measures; however, we have also seen an increase in susceptibility 
to chronic disease and frailty. Microbiome dysfunction may be linked to many of 
the conditions that increase in prevalence with age, including type 2 diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, suggesting the need for 
further research on these connections. Moreover, because both non-modifiable 
(e.g., age, sex, genetics) and environmental (e.g., diet, infection) factors can 
influence the microbiome, there are vast opportunities for the use of 
interventions related to the microbiome to promote lifespan and healthspan in 
aging populations. To understand the mechanisms mediating many of the 
interventions discussed in this review, we also provide an overview of the gut 
microbiome's relationships with the immune system, aging, and the brain. 
Importantly, we explore how inflammageing (low-grade chronic inflammation that 
often develops with age), systemic inflammation, and senescent cells may arise 
from and relate to the gut microbiome. Furthermore, we explore in detail the 
complex gut-brain axis and the evidence surrounding how gut dysbiosis may be 
implicated in several age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. We also examine 
current research on potential interventions for healthspan and lifespan as they 
relate to the changes taking place in the microbiome during aging; and we begin 
to explore how the reduction in senescent cells and senescence-associated 
secretory phenotype (SASP) interplay with the microbiome during the aging 
process and highlight avenues for further research in this area.

Atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) are commonly prescribed medications to treat 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and other psychotic disorders. However, they 
might cause metabolic syndrome (MetS) in terms of weight gain, dyslipidemia, 
type 2 diabetes (T2D), and high blood pressure, which are responsible for 
reduced life expectancy and poor adherence. Importantly, there is clear evidence 
that early metabolic disturbances can precede weight gain, even if the latter 
still remains the hallmark of AAPs use. In fact, AAPs interfere profoundly with 
glucose and lipid homeostasis acting mostly on hypothalamus, liver, pancreatic 
β-cells, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Their actions on hypothalamic 
centers via dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine receptors affect 
neuropeptides and 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, thus producing 
a supraphysiological sympathetic outflow augmenting levels of glucagon and 
hepatic glucose production. In addition, altered insulin secretion, 
dyslipidemia, fat deposition in the liver and adipose tissues, and insulin 
resistance become aggravating factors for MetS. In clinical practice, among 
AAPs, olanzapine and clozapine are associated with the highest risk of MetS, 
whereas quetiapine, risperidone, asenapine and amisulpride cause moderate 
alterations. The new AAPs such as ziprasidone, lurasidone and the partial 
agonist aripiprazole seem more tolerable on the metabolic profile. However, 
these aspects must be considered together with the differences among AAPs in 
terms of their efficacy, where clozapine still remains the most effective. 
Intriguingly, there seems to be a correlation between AAP's higher clinical 
efficacy and increase risk of metabolic alterations. Finally, a 
multidisciplinary approach combining psychoeducation and therapeutic drug 
monitoring (TDM) is proposed as a first-line strategy to avoid the MetS. In 
addition, pharmacological treatments are discussed as well.

Erratum in
    Materials (Basel). 2021 Apr 30;14(9):

The existing S-N curves by effective notch stress to assess the fatigue life of 
gusset welded joints can result in reduced accuracy due to the 
oversimplification of bead geometries. The present work proposes the parametric 
formulae of stress concentration factor (SCF) for as-welded gusset joints based 
on the spline model, by which the effective notch stress can be accurately 
calculated for fatigue resistance assessment. The spline model is also modified 
to make it applicable to the additional weld. The fatigue resistance of 
as-welded and additional-welded specimens is assessed considering the geometric 
effects and weld profiles. The results show that the error of SCFs by the 
proposed formulae is proven to be smaller than 5%. The additional weld can 
increase the fatigue life by as great as 9.4 times, mainly because the 
increasing weld toe radius and weld leg length lead to the smaller SCF. The 
proposed series of S-N curves, considering different SCFs, can be used to assess 
the welded joints with various geometric parameters and weld profiles.
