BACKGROUND: Accelerated telomere shortening is associated with stress-related 
cell damage and aging. Patients with depression have been shown to have 
shortened life expectancy and to be associated with multiple age-related 
systemic diseases. Previous studies have examined leukocyte telomere length 
(LTL) in patients with depression, but have shown inconsistent results.
METHODS: We conducted meta-analyses by pooling relevant results strictly from 
all eligible case-control studies for cross-sectional comparison of LTL between 
depressive patients and control subjects (16 studies involving 7207 subjects). 
The effect sizes (shown as Hedges' g) of each individual study were synthesized 
by using a random effects model.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed telomere length is significantly shorter in 
subjects with depression in comparison to healthy controls (Hedges' g = -0.42, 
p = 1 × 10(-5), corresponding to r = -0.21). Significant heterogeneity among 
studies examining LTL in subjects with depression was found (Q = 116.07, 
df = 16, I(2) = 86.21%, p < 1 × 10(-8)), which can possibly be explained by 
methods used in measuring telomere length (Q = 18.42, df = 2, p = 1 × 10(-4)). 
There was no significant publication bias, nor moderating effect of age, female 
percentage, or illness duration of depression on synthesized results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that depression is associated 
with accelerated cell aging. Future studies are required to clarify whether the 
association is mediated through environmental stress, and whether effective 
treatment can halt cell aging.

DO ALL THYROID NODULES >4 CM NEED TO BE REMOVED? AN EVALUATION OF THYROID 
FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY IN LARGE THYROID NODULES.

Kulstad R.

OBJECTIVE: Controversy exists regarding the ability of fine-needle aspiration 
(FNA) biopsy to rule out malignancy when thyroid nodules exceed 4 cm in 
diameter. The goal of this study was to provide data regarding FNA accuracy in a 
clinical setting for detecting/ruling out malignancy in large thyroid nodules 
(≥4 cm) and discuss FNA utility in guiding surgical decisions.
METHODS: All thyroid FNA cases performed at Marshfield Clinic from 1/1/2000 to 
12/31/2010 followed by complete or partial thyroidectomy on nodules of at least 
4 cm were identified. Demographics, medical history, nodule biopsy 
characteristics, surgical procedures, and diagnosis data were abstracted. FNA 
was compared to histologic evaluation of surgical specimens.
RESULTS: A total of 198 patients with large thyroid nodules were identified. 
Most had a single large nodule, but ~40% were multinodular, and 206 total 
nodules were assessed. Females outnumbered males, and the mean age was ~50 
years. After surgery, cancer was histologically identified in 49/206 (23.8%) 
nodules, including 9/123 nodules that had been categorized as benign by FNA, 
corresponding to a false-negative rate of 7.3%. Sensitivity/specificity for 
detecting malignancy by FNA was ~80%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 
just below 60%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 93% but rose to 96% 
when papillary microcarcinomas were excluded.
CONCLUSION: While FNA sensitivity in large nodules was relatively low, NPV was 
high, especially if incidental papillary microcarcinomas were excluded. When 
cancer prevalence and NPV are known, FNA can be a reliable "rule out" test in 
nodules ≥4 cm. This information is critical and can help guide the surgery 
decision, especially in high-risk patients. The decision for surgery should not 
be solely based on nodule size but should consider additional factors including 
cancer prevalence, clinical history, ultrasound features, surgical risk, and 
life expectancy.
ABBREVIATIONS: FNA = fine-needle aspiration NPV = negative predictive value PPV 
= positive predictive value.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of smoking in people 
living with HIV (PLWHIV) in Germany and Austria and their readiness to quit. A 
total of 447 consecutive patients with confirmed positive HIV status who were 
treated in different outpatient HIV centres in Austria and Germany were 
included. Nicotine dependence and stages of change were assessed by standardized 
questionnaires, and this was confirmed by measuring exhaled carbon monoxide. 
Prevalence of smoking was 49.4%. According to a multivariate logistic regression 
analysis, higher age (for each year of life OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.92-1.00) and 
tertiary education level (OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.15-0.79) were associated with a 
lower chance, and occasional (OR = 3.75; 95% CI 1.74-8.07) and daily smoking of 
the partner (OR 8.78; 95% CI 4.49-17.17) were significantly associated with a 
higher chance of smoking. Moderate (OR = 3.41; 95% CI = 1.30-9.05) and higher 
nicotine dependency level (OR = 3.40; 95% CI 1.46-7.94), were significantly 
associated with higher chance, and older age (for each year of life OR = 0.95; 
95% CI = 0.91-0.99), with lower chance for readiness to quit smoking. Those 
results may be used to address preventive measures to quit smoking aimed at 
PLWHIV and the importance of addressing smoking habits.

With modern surgical techniques, there is significantly increased life 
expectancy for those with congenital heart disease. Although congenital 
pulmonary valve stenosis is not as complex as tetralogy of Fallot, there are 
many similarities between the 2 lesions, such that patients with either of these 
conditions are at risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. 
Those patients who have undergone surgical palliation for congenital pulmonary 
stenosis are at an increased risk for development of ventricular arrhythmias and 
may benefit from a more aggressive evaluation for symptoms of palpitations or 
syncope.

This study examined whether avoiding or experiencing exercise-induced muscle 
damage (EIMD) influences strength gain after downhill walking training. Healthy 
young males performed treadmill downhill walking (gradient: -28%, velocity: 
5 km · h(-1) and load: 10% of body mass) 1 session per week for four weeks using 
either a ramp-up protocol (n = 16), where exercise duration was gradually 
increased from 10 to 30, 50 and 70 min over four sessions, or a constant 
protocol (n = 14), where exercise duration was 40 min for all four sessions. 
Indirect markers of EIMD were measured throughout the training period. Maximal 
knee extension torque in eccentric (-1.05 rad·s(-1)), isometric and concentric 
(1.05 rad·s(-1)) conditions were measured at pre- and post-training. The ramp-up 
group showed no indications of EIMD throughout the training period (e.g., plasma 
creatine kinase (CK) activity: always <185 U · L(-1)) while EIMD was evident 
after the first session in the constant group (CK: peak 485 U · L(-1)). Both 
groups significantly increased maximal knee extension torque in all conditions 
with greater gains in eccentric (ramp-up: +19%, constant: +21%) than isometric 
(+16%, +15%) and concentric (+12%, +10%) strength without any significant 
group-difference. The current results suggest that EIMD can be avoided by the 
ramp-up protocol and is not a major determinant of training-induced strength 
gain.

Mitochondrial short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase deficiency (ECHS1D) is caused by 
mutations in ECHS1 (OMIM 602292) and is a recently identified inborn error of 
valine and fatty acid metabolism. This defect leads to secondary mitochondrial 
dysfunction. The majority of previously reported patients had the Leigh 
syndrome, with a median life expectancy of approximately 2 years. We report two 
siblings born 3 years apart with prenatal findings including facial dysmorphia, 
oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, and premature delivery. They 
had severe lactic acidosis with onset within the first hours of life, had 
congenital dilated cardiomyopathy, and died at 16 h of life and 2 days of life, 
respectively.Biochemical evaluation of these patients showed elevated 
butyryl-carnitine in the blood and elevated methylmalonyl/succinyl-CoA and 
decreased hydroxybutyryl-CoA in frozen liver of patient 2, confirming abnormal 
short-chain fatty acid metabolism. Elevated butyryl-carnitine has been reported 
only in a single previous case of ECHS1 deficiency, which also had neonatal 
onset. Pyruvate and lactate levels were both elevated with a normal 
pyruvate-lactate ratio. This supports the previous hypothesis that lactic 
acidosis in these patients results from secondary inhibition of the pyruvate 
dehydrogenase complex. The biomarker 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid was 
detected in patient 2, but at lower levels than in previously reported 
cases.These cases extend our understanding of the severe end of the phenotypic 
spectrum of ECHS1 deficiency, clarify the range of biochemical abnormalities 
associated with this new disorder, and highlight the need to suspect this 
disease in patients presenting with comparable metabolic derangements and 
dysmorphic features.

Hip arthroplasty for the treatment of displaced fractures of the femoral neck in 
elderly patients.

This review summarises the evidence for the treatment of displaced fractures of 
the femoral neck in elderly patients. Results from randomised clinical trials 
and national register studies are presented when available. The advantages of 
arthroplasty compared with internal fixation are supported by several studies. A 
number of studies contribute to the discussions of total hip arthroplasty (THA) 
versus hemiarthroplasty and unipolar versus bipolar hemiarthroplasty, but no 
clear-cut evidence-based recommendation can be made. THA may be particularly 
advantageous for active, lucid patients with a relatively long life expectancy. 
For patients who are physiologically older, hemiarthoplasty is probably 
satisfactory, and for the oldest patients with more comorbidities, unipolar 
implants are considered to be sufficient. If the hospital can support emergency 
THA surgery in sufficient numbers and quality, there may be few patients who 
warrant bipolar hemiarthroplasty. The direct lateral approach reduces the risk 
of dislocation compared with the posterior approach. Cemented implants lower the 
risk of periprosthetic fracture and its subsequent morbidity and mortality. As 
the risk of peri-operative death related to bone cement can be reduced by 
adequate measures, cemented implants are recommended in fracture cases.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: There remains a great variation in the surgical management of 
patients with a hip fracture, and an evidence-based approach should improve the 
outcomes for this vulnerable patient group.

Loneliness and depressive symptoms are closely related, and both are indicators 
of reduced physical and mental well-being in old age. In recent years, the 
subjective perception of how long an individual expects to live (subjective life 
expectancy) has gained importance as a significant predictor of future 
psychological functioning, as well as of physical health. The current study 
examined whether subjective life expectancy moderates the connection between 
loneliness and depressive symptoms in a representative sample of older adults. 
Data was collected from the Israeli component of the fifth wave of the Survey of 
Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE-Israel). Participants (n=2210; 
mean age=70.35) completed measures of loneliness, depressive symptoms, and life 
expectancy target age. A hierarchical regression analysis predicting depressive 
symptoms yielded a significant interaction of loneliness and subjective life 
expectancy. Further analyses demonstrated that low subjective life expectancy 
mitigated the loneliness-depressive symptoms connection. Findings are discussed 
in light of the potential burden of higher subjective life expectancy for 
lonesome older adults, and practical implications are suggested.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an online adaptation of the 
diabetes prevention program (ODPP) lifestyle intervention.
METHODS: ODPP was a before-after evaluation of a weight loss intervention 
comprising 16 weekly and 8 monthly lessons, incorporating behavioral tools and 
regular, brief, web-based individualized counseling in an overweight/obese 
cohort (mean age 52, 76% female, 92% white, 28% with diabetes). A Markov model 
was developed to estimate ODPP cost effectiveness compared with usual care (UC) 
to reduce metabolic risk over 10years. Intervention costs and weight change 
outcomes were obtained from the study; other model parameters were based on 
published reports. In the model, diabetes risk was a function of weight change 
with and without the intervention.
RESULTS: Compared to UC, the ODPP in our cohort cost $14,351 and $29,331 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the health care system and 
societal perspectives, respectively. In a hypothetical cohort without diabetes, 
the ODPP cost $7777 and $18,263 per QALY gained, respectively. Results were 
robust in sensitivity analyses, but enrolling cohorts with lower annual risk of 
developing diabetes (≤1.8%), enrolling fewer participants (≤15), or increasing 
the hourly cost (≥$91.20) or annual per-participant time (≥1.45h) required for 
technical support could increase ODPP cost to >$20,000 per QALY gained. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses, ODPP was cost-effective in 20-58% of model 
iterations using an acceptability threshold of $20,000, 73-92% at $50,000, and 
95-99% at $100,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The ODPP may offer an economical approach to combating overweight 
and obesity.

In medical literature there are numerous multidimensional scales to measure 
health states for dependence in activities of daily living. However, these 
scales are not preference-based and are not able to yield QALYs. On the 
contrary, the generic preference-based measures are not sensitive enough to 
measure changes in dependence states. The objective of this paper is to propose 
a new dependency health state classification system, called DEP-6D, and to 
estimate its value set in such a way that it can be used in QALY calculations. 
DEP-6D states are described as a combination of 6 attributes (eat, incontinence, 
personal care, mobility, housework and cognition problems), with 3-4 levels 
each. A sample of 312 Spanish citizens was surveyed in 2011 to estimate the 
DEP-6D preference-scoring algorithm. Each respondent valued six out of the 24 
states using time trade-off questions. After excluding those respondents who 
made two or more inconsistencies (6% out of the sample), each state was valued 
between 66 and 77 times. The responses present a high internal and external 
consistency. A random effect model accounting for main effects was the preferred 
model to estimate the scoring algorithm. The DEP-6D describes, in general, more 
severe problems than those usually described by means of generic 
preference-based measures. The minimum score predicted by the DEP-6D algorithm 
is -0.84, which is considerably lower than the minimum value predicted by the 
EQ-5D and SF-6D algorithms. The DEP-6D value set is based on community 
preferences. Therefore it is consistent with the so-called 'societal 
perspective'. Moreover, DEP-6D preference weights can be used in QALY 
calculations and cost-utility analysis.

PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus rivaroxaban, 
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)/dabigatran, and LMWH/vitamin K antagonist 
(VKA) for the initial treatment and prevention of recurrent thromboembolic 
events in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE).
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic effect of 
6 months of treatment with apixaban versus other anticoagulants over a lifetime 
horizon. Network meta-analyses were conducted using the results of the Apixaban 
after the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep Vein Thrombosis with 
First-Line Therapy (AMPLIFY), EINSTEIN-pooled, and RE-COVER I and II trials for 
the following end points: recurrent VTE, major bleeds, clinically relevant 
non-major bleeds, and treatment discontinuations. The analysis was conducted 
from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Service. The outcomes 
evaluated were the number of events avoided in a 1000-patient cohort, total 
costs, life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost per QALY gained 
over a patient's lifetime.
FINDINGS: Treatment for 6 months with apixaban was projected to result in fewer 
recurrent VTE and bleeding events in comparison to rivaroxaban, LMWH/dabigatran, 
and LMWH/VKA. Apixaban was cost-effective compared with LMWH/VKA at an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £2520 per QALY gained and was a dominant 
(ie, lower costs and higher QALYs) alternative to either rivaroxaban or 
LMWH/dabigatran. Sensitivity analysis indicated that results were robust over a 
wide range of inputs.
IMPLICATIONS: The assessment of the effects and costs of apixaban in this study 
predicted that apixaban is a dominant alternative to rivaroxaban and 
LMWH/dabigatran and a cost-effective alternative to LMWH/VKA for 6 months of

AIM: This protocol paper describes a study that aims to determine if protected 
mealtimes implementation closes the energy deficit of 1900 kJ between estimated 
requirements and actual energy intake of hospitalized adults in the subacute 
setting.
BACKGROUND: Protected mealtimes, a strategy developed to address the prevalence 
of malnourished hospitalized adults, aims to minimize unavoidable and 
unnecessary interruptions at mealtimes. It has been implemented widely with 
limited high-quality studies as to its effect.
DESIGN: A pragmatic stepped wedge cluster trial. Primary outcomes are daily 
energy and protein intake.
METHODS: Funding was awarded in October 2014. In this study, protected mealtimes 
implementation will occur across each cluster (ward) chosen at random. A waiver 
of consent has been endorsed, enabling all patients to receive the intervention. 
Patients excluded from outcome evaluation will be those receiving end of life 
care and patients who are nil by mouth. The selection of patients for outcome 
evaluation will also occur randomly. Sample size, randomization, statistical 
analysis and contamination issues consider the reporting guidelines of the 
CONSORT statement: extension to cluster randomized trials.
CONCLUSIONS: The methods selected will ensure that the research is of high 
quality with conclusions useful and relevant for translation into practice 
settings. The study does not aim to assess whether the intervention is 
sustainable beyond the study period, rather it will establish whether the 
removal of known barriers to intervention uptake enables high fidelity with the 
intervention. As a result we will have a greater understanding of the 
nutritional consequences of protected mealtimes in subacute care.

In Japan the onset of lifestyle-related diseases has increased, the people 
interests in "food and health", and the movement of the food industry is 
actively to respond to it. Healthy life expectancy is essential for mitigation 
of social medical expenses and improvement of the personal QOL in the super-aged 
society. Daily diet becomes the nucleus of healthy life expectancy. 
Historically, the concept of "functional food" system was born in the mid-1980s 
in ahead of our country in the world. Administration as a response to it to 
allow on that review, "food for specified health uses" was born. Furthermore, 
foods with a prevention function of lifestyle-related diseases, such as "Foods 
with Function Claims" system have been developing from 2015. In this paper, we 
want to further describe these circumstances, the current situation and the 
outlook.

Introduction The Elective Orthopaedic Centre in Epsom has an established patient 
reported outcome measures programme, into which all patients are enrolled. 
Postoperative complications, Oxford hip/knee scores (OHS/OKS) and EQ-5D™ 
(EuroQol, Rotterdam, Netherlands) scores are collected up to the second 
postoperative year. Our population is ageing and the number of joint 
replacements being performed on the very elderly is rising. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the outcome of joint replacements in a nonagenarian 
population. Methods Our dataset was reviewed retrospectively for a cohort of 
nonagenarians undergoing either a primary total hip replacement (THR) or total 
knee replacement (TKR) between April 2008 and October 2011. Postoperative 
complications, mortality rates and functional outcomes were compared with those 
of a time matched 70-79-year-old cohort. Results Nonagenarians requiring a THR 
presented with a lower preoperative OHS (p=0.020) but made a greater improvement 
in the first postoperative year than the younger cohort (p=0.040). The 
preoperative OKS was lower for nonagenarians than for the control group 
(p=0.022). At one and two years after TKR, however, there was no significant 
difference between the age groups. The nonagenarians had a greater risk of 
requiring a blood transfusion following both THR (p=0.027; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.11-5.75) and TKR (p=0.037; 95% CI: 1.08-16.65) while the latter 
cohort also required a longer stay than their younger counterparts (p=0.001). 
Mortality rates were higher in the nonagenarian group but these were in keeping 
with the life expectancy projections identified by the Office for National 
Statistics. Conclusions Over a two-year period, the functional outcome and 
satisfaction rates achieved by nonagenarians following a THR or TKR are 
comparable with 70-79-year-olds.

and Genetics, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark.

The effectiveness of a drug is dependent on accumulation at the site of action 
at therapeutic levels, however, challenges such as rapid renal clearance, 
degradation or non-specific accumulation requires drug delivery enabling 
technologies. Albumin is a natural transport protein with multiple ligand 
binding sites, cellular receptor engagement, and a long circulatory half-life 
due to interaction with the recycling neonatal Fc receptor. Exploitation of 
these properties promotes albumin as an attractive candidate for half-life 
extension and targeted intracellular delivery of drugs attached by covalent 
conjugation, genetic fusions, association or ligand-mediated association. This 
review will give an overview of albumin-based products with focus on the natural 
biological properties and molecular interactions that can be harnessed for the 
design of a next-generation drug delivery platform.

BACKGROUND: In the First-In-Human (FIH), 39-week, randomized, adaptive design 
study, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers were measured in 
patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) after infusion of a 
humanized monoclonal antibody to amyloid β, AAB-003 (NCT01193608; registered 19 
August 2010). AAB-003 was developed by modifying bapineuzumab to reduce 
Fc-receptor-mediated effector function as a strategy to reduce the removal of 
amyloid from vessel walls associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
with edema/effusions (ARIA-E) without diminishing overall amyloid clearance.
METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with AD received up to three infusions of AAB-003 
(or placebo) 13 weeks apart at doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg in the FIH 
trial. Dose escalation was based on safety data reviews using a Bayesian 
escalation algorithm. Subjects who completed the FIH study were permitted to 
enter a 1-year open-label extension trial with four additional intravenous 
infusions of AAB-003 (NCT01369225; registered 10 May 2011).
RESULTS: Dose-dependent increases in plasma amyloid β and AAB-003 were observed. 
No significant changes in cerebral spinal fluid biomarkers were observed. 
Pharmacokinetics elimination half-life (21-28 days) clearance and volume of 
distribution values were consistent across dose groups indicating linearity. 
ARIA-E was the most notable safety finding detected by magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) at 8 mg/kg in two patients. Three cases of microhemorrhage were 
observed. No new safety findings or MRI abnormalities were observed for the 52 
subjects who received AAB-003 in the extension trial.
CONCLUSION: Based on integrated review of laboratory, electrocardiogram, adverse 
events, and MRI, AAB-003 was safe and well tolerated up to 8 mg/kg for up to 91 
weeks (FIH and extension trials) in patients with mild to moderate AD. 
Asymptomatic and resolvable ARIA-E was observed after the first or second 
infusion of AAB-003, similar to bapineuzumab. The AAB-003 dose at which ARIA-E 
was observed was higher compared to bapineuzumab, supporting the hypothesis that 
reducing Fc-receptor effector function may reduce the ARIA associated with 
monoclonal antibodies targeting cerebral amyloid.

Supportive Care and Second-line Chemotherapy for Platinum-resistant or 
Refractory Ovarian Cancer.

BACKGROUND: There is no standard treatment for patients with platinum-resistant 
or refractory epithelial ovarian cancer. Single agent chemotherapies have 
evidence of more efficacy and less toxicity than combination therapy. Most are 
very expensive, with appreciable toxicity and minimal survival. Since it is 
difficult to make comparison between outcomes, economic analysis of single-agent 
chemotherapy regimens and best supportive care may help to make decisions about 
an appropriate management for the affected patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of second-line chemotherapy 
compared with best supportive care for patients with platinum-resistant or 
refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the effectiveness and 
total costs associated with treatments. The hypothetical patient population 
comprised women aged 55 with platinum-resistant or refractory epithelial ovarian 
cancer. Four types of alternative treatment options were evaluated: 1) 
gemcitabine followed by BSC; 2) pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) followed 
by BSC; 3) gemcitabine followed by topotecan; and 4) PLD followed by topotecan. 
Baseline comparator of alternative treatments was BSC. Time horizon of the 
analysis was 2 years. Health care provider perspective and 3% discount rate were 
used to determine the costs of medical treatment in this study. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY) were used to measure the treatment effectiveness. Treatment 
effectiveness data were derived from the literature. Costs were calculated from 
unit cost treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer patients at various stages of 
disease in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH) in the year 2011. 
Parameter uncertainty was tested in probabilistic sensitivity analysis by using 
Monte Carlo simulation. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to explore each 
variable's impact on the uncertainty of the results.
RESULTS: Approximated life expectancy of best supportive care was 0.182 years 
and its total cost was 26,862 Baht. All four alternative treatments increased 
life expectancy. Life expectancy of gemcitabine followed by BSC, PLD followed by 
BSC, gemcitabine followed by topotecan and PLD followed by topotecan was 0.510, 
0.513, 0.566, and 0.570 years, respectively. The total cost of gemcitabine 
followed by BSC, PLD followed by BSC, gemcitabine followed by topotecan and PLD 
followed by topotecan was 113,000, 124,302, 139,788 and 151,135 Baht, 
respectively. PLD followed by topotecan had the highest expected 
quality-adjusted life-years but was the most expensive of all the above 
strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of gemcitabine 
followed by BSC, PLD followed by BSC, gemcitabine followed by topotecan and PLD 
followed by topotecan was 344,643, 385,322, 385,856, and 420,299 Baht, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: All of the second-line chemotherapy strategies showed certain 
benefits due to an increased life- year gained compared with best supportive 
care. Moreover, gemcitabine as second-line chemotherapy followed by best 
supportive care in progressive disease case was likely to be more effective 
strategy with less cost from health care provider perspective. Gemcitabine was 
the most cost-effective treatment among all four alternative treatments. ICER is 
only an economic factor. Treatment decisions should be based on the patient 
benefit.

PURPOSE: Treatment decisions in patients with prostate cancer are affected by 
patient age regardless of higher life expectancy compared to the baseline 
population. Our aim was to quantify cancer specific and other cause mortality 
rates after radical prostatectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 8,741 patients with prostate cancer underwent 
radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2009 at a European center. Ten-year other 
cause and cancer specific mortality rates were determined by age and 
comorbidities, and age and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical 
(CAPRA-S) risk groups. Competing risk regression was used for risk factor 
analyses including clinical and pathological variables.
RESULTS: Ten-year other cause mortality rates increased with patient age, 
including 4.8%, 9.8%, 13.6% and 16.5% in men younger than 60, 60 to 64, 65 to 69 
and 70 years or older, respectively. Cancer specific mortality was the leading 
cause of death in CAPRA-S high risk cases regardless of age. On multivariate 
analyses age groups achieved independent predictor status for other cause 
mortality (ages 60 to 64 years HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.26-2.62, 65 to 69 years HR 
2.48, 95% CI 1.73-3.56 and 70 years or greater HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.97-4.62) as 
well as Charlson comorbidity indexes 1 (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.00-2.09) and 3 or 
greater (HR 3.99, 95% CI 1.57-10.1). Gleason score 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 or greater, 
pT3b stage, lymph node invasion and positive margin status achieved independent 
predictor status when the end point was cancer specific mortality. The CAPRA-S 
high risk constellation increased cancer specific mortality risk in multifold 
fashion (HR 26, 95% CI 16-56).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with the CAPRA-S high risk constellation the rate of 
cancer specific mortality increased in multifold fashion and contributed to most 
deaths regardless of patient age. Low other cause mortality rates in all age 
groups showed reasonable patient selection.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depressive disorder in adults with advanced cancer 
is around 20 %. Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is recommended for 
depression and may be beneficial in depressed people with cancer, its use for 
depression in those with advanced disease for whom cure is not likely has not 
been explored.
METHODS: People aged 18 years and above with advanced cancer attending General 
Practitioner (GP), oncology or hospice outpatients from centres across England 
will be screened to establish a DSM-IV diagnosis of depression. Self-referral is 
also accepted. Eligible consenters will be randomised to a single blind, 
multicentre, randomised controlled trial of the addition to treatment as usual 
(TAU) of up to 12 one-hour weekly sessions of manualised CBT versus TAU alone. 
Sessions are delivered in primary care through Increasing Access to 
Psychological Care (IAPT) service, and the manual includes a focus on issues for 
people approaching the end of life. The main outcome is the Beck Depression 
Inventory-II (BDI-II). Subsidiary measures include the Patient Health 
Questionnaire, quality of life measure EQ-5D, Satisfaction with care, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status and a modified Client Service 
Receipt Inventory. At 90 % power, we require 240 participants to enter the 
trial. Data will be analysed using multi-level (hierarchical) models for data 
collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks. Cost effectiveness analysis will 
incorporate costs related to the intervention to compare overall healthcare 
costs and QALYs between the treatment arms. We will conduct qualitative 
interviews after final follow-up on patient and therapist perspectives of the 
therapy.
DISCUSSION: This trial will provide data on the clinical and cost effectiveness 
of CBT for people with advanced cancer and depression. We shall gain an 
understanding of the feasibility of delivering care to this group through IAPT. 
Our findings will provide evidence for policy-makers, commissioners and 
clinicians in cancer and palliative care, and in the community.

Osteoporosis is a progressive, systemic bone disorder characterized by loss of 
bone mass and microstructure, leading to reduced bone strength and increased 
risk of fracture. It is often associated with reduced quality of life and other 
medical complications. The disease is common in the aging population, 
particularly among postmenopausal women and patients who receive long-term 
steroidal therapy. Given the rapid growth of the aging population, increasing 
life expectancy, the prevalence of bone loss, and financial burden to the 
healthcare system and individuals, demand for new therapeutic agents and 
nutritional supplements for the management and promotion of bone health is 
pressing. With the advent of global interest in complementary and alternative 
medicine and natural products, Chinese medicine serves as a viable source to 
offer benefits for the improvement and maintenance of bone health. This review 
summarizes the scientific information obtained from recent literatures on the 
chemical ingredients of Chinese medicinal plants that have been reported to 
possess osteoprotective and related properties in cell-based and/or animal 
models. Some of these natural products (or their derivatives) may become 
promising leads for development into dietary supplements or therapeutic drugs.

BACKGROUND: Care home residents with stroke-related disabilities have 
significant activity limitations. Phase II trial results suggested a potential 
benefit of occupational therapy (OT) in maintaining residents' capacity to 
engage in functional activity.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 
targeted course of OT in maintaining functional activity and reducing further 
health risks from inactivity for UK care home residents living with 
stroke-related disabilities.
DESIGN: Pragmatic, parallel-group, cluster randomised controlled trial with 
economic evaluation. Cluster randomisation occurred at the care-home level. 
Homes were stratified according to trial administrative centre and type of care 
provided (nursing or residential), and they were randomised 1 : 1 to either the 
intervention or the control arm.
SETTING: The setting was 228 care homes which were local to 11 trial 
administrative centres across England and Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: Care home residents with a history of stroke or transient
