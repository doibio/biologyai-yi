immunosuppressive therapy are at the highest risk of contracting the disease. 
Average life expectancy throughout developed countries has rapidly increased 
during the latter half of the 20th century and geriatric infectious diseases 
have become an increasingly important issue. L. monocytogenes meningitis in 
young previously healthy adults has been reported only in anecdotal 
observations. Differently, L. monocytogenes is the third most common cause of 
bacterial meningitis in the elderly population, after Streptococcus pneumoniae 
and Neisseria meningitidis. Patients with L. monocytogenes meningitis presented 
with signs and symptoms that were similar to those of the general population 
with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, but reported a longer prodromal 
phase. According to literature data, the prevalence of the classic triad of 
fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status is 43%, and almost all patients 
present with at least 2 of the 4 classic symptoms of headache, fever, neck 
stiffness, and altered mental status. On the basis of our published data, in 
patients aged over 50 years, diagnosing L. monocytogenes meningitis was more 
challenging than pneumococcal meningitis, as demonstrated by the lower 
percentage of cases receiving a correct diagnosis within 48 hours from the onset 
of symptoms. No significant difference was observed in respect to the presenting 
symptoms, but progression to respiratory failure was not as rapid as 
pneumococcal meningitis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Evidence-based strategies are needed to address the growing 
complexity of care of those ageing with HIV so that as life expectancy is 
extended, quality of life is also enhanced.
RECENT FINDINGS: Modifiable contributing factors to the quantity and quality of 
life in adults ageing with HIV include: burden of harmful health behaviours, 
injury from HIV infection, HIV treatment toxicity and general burden of 
age-associated comorbidities. In turn, these factors contribute to geriatric 
syndromes including multimorbidity and polypharmacy, physiologic frailty, falls 
and fragility fractures and cognitive dysfunction, which further compromise the 
quality of life long before they lead to mortality.
SUMMARY: Viral suppression of HIV with combination antiviral therapy has led to 
increasing longevity but has not enabled a complete return to health among 
ageing HIV-infected individuals (HIV+). As adults age with HIV, the role of HIV 
itself and associated inflammation, effects of exposure to antiretroviral 
agents, the high prevalence of modifiable risk factors for age-associated 
conditions (e.g. smoking), and the effects of other viral coinfections are all 
influencing the health trajectory of persons ageing with HIV. We must move from 
the simplistic notion of HIV becoming a 'chronic controllable illness' to 
understanding the continually evolving 'treated' history of HIV infection with 
the burden of age-associated conditions and geriatric syndromes in the context 
of an altered and ageing immune system.

In Europe depending on the country 15-80 % of all individuals infected with 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are either not aware of the diagnosis or are 
diagnosed later. An early HIV diagnosis could, however, considerably improve the 
prognosis of individuals infected with HIV and decrease the risk of new 
infections; therefore, in the presence of indicator diseases, such as sexually 
transmitted diseases, oral thrush, herpes zoster and lymphoma, the performance 
of a HIV test is of utmost importance. A newly diagnosed HIV infection 
represents an indication for starting antiretroviral combination therapy 
independent of the clinical stage or CD4 cell count. A decline of the viral 
burden to below the limit of detection and subsequent continuous suppression of 
viral replication can prevent transition from HIV to acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) and if started early enough a normal life expectancy can be 
achieved. Challenges which remain in HIV therapy are the lifelong daily intake 
of medication and the complex long-term adverse effects.

PURPOSE: Delivery errors during radiotherapy may lead to medical harm and 
reduced life expectancy for patients. Such serious incidents can be avoided by 
performing dose verification online, i.e., while the patient is being 
irradiated, creating the possibility of halting the linac in case of a large 
overdosage or underdosage. The offline EPID-based 3D in vivo dosimetry system 
clinically employed at our institute is in principle suited for online treatment 
verification, provided the system is able to complete 3D dose reconstruction and 
verification within 420 ms, the present acquisition time of a single EPID frame. 
It is the aim of this study to show that our EPID-based dosimetry system can be 
made fast enough to achieve online 3D in vivo dose verification.
METHODS: The current dose verification system was sped up in two ways. First, a 
new software package was developed to perform all computations that are not 
dependent on portal image acquisition separately, thus removing the need for 
doing these calculations in real time. Second, the 3D dose reconstruction 
algorithm was sped up via a new, multithreaded implementation. Dose verification 
was implemented by comparing planned with reconstructed 3D dose distributions 
delivered to two regions in a patient: the target volume and the nontarget 
volume receiving at least 10 cGy. In both volumes, the mean dose is compared, 
while in the nontarget volume, the near-maximum dose (D2) is compared as well. 
The real-time dosimetry system was tested by irradiating an anthropomorphic 
phantom with three VMAT plans: a 6 MV head-and-neck treatment plan, a 10 MV 
rectum treatment plan, and a 10 MV prostate treatment plan. In all plans, two 
types of serious delivery errors were introduced. The functionality of 
automatically halting the linac was also implemented and tested.
RESULTS: The precomputation time per treatment was ∼180 s/treatment arc, 
depending on gantry angle resolution. The complete processing of a single portal 
frame, including dose verification, took 266 ± 11 ms on a dual octocore Intel 
Xeon E5-2630 CPU running at 2.40 GHz. The introduced delivery errors were 
detected after 5-10 s irradiation time.
CONCLUSIONS: A prototype online 3D dose verification tool using portal imaging 
has been developed and successfully tested for two different kinds of gross 
delivery errors. Thus, online 3D dose verification has been technologically 
achieved.

Ecology and Evolution of Phenotypic Plasticity in the Penis and Cirri of 
Barnacles.

Most barnacles are sessile, simultaneous hermaphrodites that reproduce by 
copulation. This is achieved through the extension of a muscular penis, famous 
for being the proportionally largest in the animal kingdom. The penis is a long 
cylindrical or conical organ, composed of a series of folded rings, allowing it 
to stretch to great lengths. The penises are covered with chemosensory setae 
allowing them to seek out receptive neighbors. For many species, the condition 
of the penis changes seasonally. In the most extreme circumstances, it 
degenerates and is shed during the first post-mating molt and is re-grown for 
the next mating season. Barnacle penises have been shown to exhibit phenotypic 
plasticity in response to many different challenges. When exposed to heavy 
waves, diameter is increased by thickening both the cuticle and muscles. When 
mates are far, length increases by adding ringed annulations. Experiments have 
shown that these plastic traits are modular, capable of changing independently 
from each other and that they improve mating ability. Alternate strategies to 
increase reproductive ability by barnacles include the production of dwarf and 
complemental males, sperm casting and sperm leakage, and aerial copulation. All 
of these mating strategies may have important implications for the study of 
reproductive biology, life history, and sex allocation theory.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has reported a decrease in all-cause mortality 
during times of economic recession. Our objective was to identify the short-term 
effects of the current Great Recession on life expectancy at birth in Europe, 
and the role of social protection typology, income and gender.
METHODS: We used a pooled time series cross-sectional design, with 232 European 
regions (level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) as the 
unit of analysis over 10 years (2003-12). The dependent variable was life 
expectancy at birth, and the independent variable was unemployment rate. We fit 
a model in first differences for the periods before and during the Great 
Recession (2003-07 and 2008-12, respectively), and stratified by sex, social 
protection typology (Eastern, Mediterranean and Northern) and regional income 
per capita RESULTS: We observed a negative association during the Great 
Recession between life expectancy (in years) and in unit change in unemployment 
among men and women in low-income Mediterranean regions [-0.048(95%CI: 
-0.081,-0.014) and -0.050(95%CI:-0.091,-0.007), respectively] but no change in 
trend, and a change in trend to a non-significant negative association among men 
in high-income Mediterranean and Northern regions (P = 0.005 and P = 0.002, 
respectively). We also observed a positive association among men in 
middle-income Mediterranean regions [0.044 (95%CI:0.004,0.084)], with change in 
trend (P = 0.047), and Eastern regions [0.042 (95%CI:0.001,0.072)] without 
change in trend.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our data do not support the notion that increased life 
expectancy is associated with unemployment during the Great Recession.

The world population is aging, and by 2017, there will be more people over the 
age of 65 than under age 5, and by 2050, two billion of the estimated nine 
billion people on Earth will be older than 60. Aging itself is a major 
cardiovascular risk factor, affecting morbidity and mortality of the aging 
population. At the same time, aging increases the likelihood of the presence of 
other risk factors. The aged myocardium is characterized by several structural 
and functional progressive changes that impair its ability to respond 
appropriately to stressful conditions. Although some progress to understand the 
complex mechanisms that underlie these phenotypic changes, the molecular 
pathways that determine the balance between aging and rejuvenation in the aged 
myocardium still remain elusive. In this article, we review molecular mechanisms 
responsible for the phenotypic changes observed with aging in the heart, 
providing insight into molecular pathways and pharmacological interventions that 
may rejuvenate the aged myocardium. A better understanding of these pathways is 
essential for determining their therapeutic potential in humans, improving the 
possibility that the increase in life expectancy that we are observing will be 
accompanied by a parallel increase in healthspan.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-utility analysis on an integrated healthcare model 
comprising an assigned internist and a hospital liaison nurse for patients with 
multimorbidity, compared to a conventional reactive healthcare system.
METHODS: A cluster randomised clinical trial was conducted. The model consisted 
of a reference internist and a liaison nurse, who aimed to improve coordination 
and communication between levels and to enhance continuity of care after 
hospitalisation. We recorded sociodemographic data, diagnoses and corresponding 
clinical categories, functional status, use of healthcare resources and quality 
of life. Data were collected by reviewing electronic medical records and 
administering questionnaires. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses 
both for utilities and total costs. Bootstrapping methods were applied to 
calculate the confidence ellipses of incremental costs and efficiency.
RESULTS: We recruited a total of 140 patients. The model assessed was not found 
to be efficient in general. We found an incremental cost of €1,035.90 and an 
incremental benefit of -0.0762 QALYs for the initiative compared to standard 
care after adjusting for the main variables. However, the subgroup of patients 
under 80 years of age with three or more clinical categories resulted in an 89% 
cost saving in the simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: The integrated model was not suitable for all study patients. 
However, the subgroup analysis identified a narrow target population that should 
be analysed in future studies.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
with an unknown cause. Studies have reported that the incidence rate of ALS 
might be changing. As ALS is an age related disease, crude incidence could 
increase as population structure changes and overall life expectancy improves. 
Age-period-cohort (APC) models are frequently used to investigate trends in 
demographic rates such as incidence. Age-specific incidence rate for ALS from 
1996 to 2014 were taken from a population-based ALS register in Ireland. To 
circumvent the well-known identifiability issue in APC models, we apply the 
method of Partial Least Squares Regression to separate the effects of Age, 
Period and Cohort on ALS incidence over time. This APC analysis shows no cohort 
effect and the initial signs of a period effect; increasing incidence of ALS in 
the most recently diagnosed group. As further years of data accrue to the Irish 
register it will become clear if this effect emerges as a strong trend in the 
incidence of ALS in Ireland and replication of these analyses in other 
populations will show if our findings on temporal patterns in ALS incidence are 
shared elsewhere.

Aspirin use for primary prevention in elderly patients.

[Article in English, Italian]

Terrosu P(1).

Author information:
(1)Ospedale Civile SS. Annunziata. pterrosu@hotmail.com.

The net clinical benefit of aspirin in primary prevention is uncertain as the 
reduction in occlusive events needs to be balanced against the increase in 
gastro-intestinal and cerebral bleedings. The meta-analysis of ATT (Anti 
Thrombotic Trialists) Collaboration in 2009 showed that aspirin therapy in 
primary prevention was associated with 12% reduction in cardio-vascular events, 
due mainly to a reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.18% vs 0.23% per 
year, p<0.0001). However, the benefit in term of coronary events was almost 
balanced by the increase in major bleedings. The balance between potential 
benefit and harm of aspirin differs in each person and appears to be favorable 
in subjects at higher cardio-vascular risk. Older people have increased risk of 
hemorrhage as well as increased risk of heart attack and stroke. As a 
consequence, it is important consider both likelihoods of benefits as well as 
harm within the lifespan and functioning of the person. The older people who 
most likely benefit from aspirin in primary prevention are those at higher 
cardio-vascular risk, with preserved functional abilities, low comorbidity, low 
risk of bleeding and a prolonged life expectancy.

In this editorial, we consider the vexing issue of 'unrelated future costs' (for 
example, the costs of caring for people with dementia or kidney failure after 
preventing their deaths from a heart attack). The National Institute of Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance is not to take such costs into account in 
technology appraisals. However, standard appraisal practice involves modelling 
the benefits of those unrelated technologies. We argue that there is a sound 
principled reason for including both the costs and benefits of unrelated care. 
Changing this practice would have material consequences for decisions about 
reimbursing particular technologies, and we urge future research to understand 
this better. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Quality of life of hemodialysis patients in Central and Southern Italy: 
cross-sectional comparison between Hemodiafiltration with endogenous reinfusion

INTRODUCTION: in hemodialysis (HD) patients, poor health-related quality of life 
(HR-QoL) is prevalent and associated with adverse outcomes. HR-QoL is strictly 
linked to nutritional status of HD patients. Hemodiafiltration with endogenous 
reinfusion (HFR) is an alternative dialysis technique that combines diffusion, 
convection and absorption. It reduces burden of inflammation and malnutrition 
and this effect may cause beneficial effect on HR-QoL. However no data on HR-QoL 
in HFR is currently available.
METHODS: we designed a cross-sectional multicentre study in order to compare the 
HR-QoL in patients treated with HFR versus Bicarbonate HD (BHD). We enrolled 
adult patients HFR treated for at least 6 months, with life expectancy greater 
than six months and without overt cognitive deficit. The recruited patients in 
HFR were matched for age, gender, dialytic vintage and performance in activities 
of daily living (Barthel index) with BHD treated patients. SF-36 questionnaire 
for the assessment of HR-QoL was administered.
RESULTS: one hundred fourteen patients (57 HFR vs 57 BHD) were enrolled (age 
65.413.5 years; dialysis vintage 5.4 (3.3-10.3) years; 53% males) from 18 
dialysis non-profit centres in central and southern Italy. As result of 
matching, no difference in age, gender, dialytic age and Barthel index was found 
between HFR and BHD patients. In HFR patients we observed better values of 
physical component score (PCS) of SF-36 than BHD patients (P=0.048), whereas no 
significant difference emerged in the mental component score (P=0.698). In 
particular HFR patients were associated with higher Physical Functioning 
(P=0.045) and Role Physical (P=0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: HFR is associated with better physical component of HR-QoL than 
BHD, independently of age, gender, dialysis vintage and invalidity score. 
Whether these findings translate into a survival benefit must be investigated by 
longitudinal studies.

OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Historical studies report high rupture rates in patients 
with nonoperated abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) of > 5.5 cm diameter, 
although a recent audit has questioned this.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 138/764 (18%) patients with AAAs 
evaluated in a preassessment anaesthetic clinic (PAC) between 2006 and 2012, who 
either did not undergo elective AAA repair or who underwent deferred repair. The 
remaining 626 underwent repair. Patients with severe comorbidities (dementia, 
advanced malignancy, life-expectancy < 1 year) and not referred to PAC were 
excluded.
RESULTS: At a median of 27 months, 71 (52%) died, 36 (51%) following rupture. 
Cumulative survival, free from rupture or surgery for acute symptoms, was 96% at 
1 year, 84% at 3 years, and 64% at 5 years, where baseline AAA diameters were 
5.5-6.9 cm. For diameters ≥ 7 cm, survival, free from rupture, was 65% at 1 
year, 29% at 3 years, and 0% at 5 years. Median interval to rupture was 47 
months (AAA diameter 5.5-6.9 cm) and 21 months where baseline diameters were ≥ 
7 cm. Rupture accounted for 32% of late deaths in patients with AAAs of 
5.5-5.9 cm diameter, 46% in those with AAAs measuring 6.0-6.9 cm in diameter, 
and 71% in patients with AAA measuring ≥ 7 cm in diameter.
CONCLUSION: Approximately half of all late deaths in this nonoperated cohort 
were not AAA related, suggesting that even had repair been undertaken, it would 
not have prolonged patient survival. The incidence of rupture in "high-risk" 
patients with an AAA < 7 cm diameter was < 5% at 1 year, thereby giving ample 
time to optimise risk factors and improve pre-existing medical conditions prior 
to undertaking a deferred intervention. Even if these patients did not undergo 
surgical repair, the risk of late rupture was relatively low. By contrast, 
nonoperated patients with AAAs ≥ 7 cm in diameter face a very high risk of 
rupture and will probably benefit from elective surgery, with the caveat that a 
higher procedural risk might have to be incurred.

Severe generalized junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a lethal hereditary 
blistering disorder, is usually treated by palliative care. Allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation (SCT) has been proposed as a therapeutic approach, yet without 
clinical evidence. Decision making was evaluated retrospectively in 76 patients 
with severe generalized junctional epidermolysis bullosa born in the years 
2000-2015. The diagnosis was based on the absence of laminin-332 in skin 
biopsies. With an incidence of 1 of 150,000, severe generalized junctional 
epidermolysis bullosa occurred more often than published previously. Eleven as 
yet unreported mutations in the laminin-332 genes were detected. Although 
patients homozygous for the LAMB3 mutation c.1903C>T lived longer than the 
others, life expectancy was greatly diminished (10.8 vs. 4.6 months). Most 
patients failed to thrive. In two patients with initially normal weight gain, 
the decision for SCT from haploidentical bone marrow or peripheral blood was 
made. Despite transiently increasing skin erosions, the clinical status of both 
subjects stabilized for several weeks after SCT, but finally deteriorated. Graft 
cells, but no laminin-332, were detected in skin biopsies. The patients died 96 
and 129 days after SCT, respectively, one of them after receiving additional 
skin grafts. Treatment of severe generalized junctional epidermolysis bullosa by 
SCT is a last-ditch attempt still lacking proof of efficacy.

The potential of chitosan as a possible booster of the antimicrobial activity of 
Origanum vulgare EO (OEO) against spoilage bacteria and Listeria monocytogenes 
was investigated in fresh pork meat. Pork fillets were inoculated with 3 
L. monocytogenes strains, dipped either in Origanum vulgare (oregano) Essential 
Oil (OEO) at 2 and 4%, or in chitosan 1% alone or added with 2 and 4% OEO, then 
packed under modified atmosphere (70% O2, 20% CO2, 10% N2) and stored at 4 °C 
for 15 days. OEO did not reduce L. monocytogenes growth, while 2 Log decrease 
was obtained after 2 days of storage in treatments with chitosan alone or with 
OEO, with growth inhibition up to day 15 in samples with chitosan and OEO 4%. 
When OEO was combined with chitosan, total viable counts and spoilage bacteria 
were reduced and contained over time, particularly Pseudomonas (2.0 Log CFU/g at 
day 15) and Brochothrix thermosphacta (undetectable). All the treatments applied 
extended meat shelf-life with respect to control, whose commercial shelf-life 
was 10 days. Chitosan treatments enhanced L* and maintained a* values almost 
stable during storage. Chitosan and OEO singly applied reduced lipid oxidation 
(0.62-0.75 mg malondialdehyde/Kg meat) compared to control (0.99 mg 
malondialdehyde/Kg meat). Finally, chitosan treated samples were not recognized 
with respect to the control, whereas OEO gave bitter taste; chitosan with OEO 
instead mitigated the effect of OEO addition to meat. Chitosan combined with OEO 
boosts its antimicrobial activity and shows a potential for application in 
industrial production of fresh pork in MAP, to achieve shelf-life extension, 
control of L. monocytogenes growth, stability of color and protective effect 
from oxidation, with low sensory impact.

The kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (F.), is an urban nuisance and significant 
agricultural pest. The median lethal concentrations of three strains of 
Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo), including the Mississippi Delta native strain 
(NI8) isolated from Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois), the commercial 
strain BotaniGard(®) (GHA) (Victor, NY, USA), and the B. bassiana strain 
isolated from M. cribraria (KUDSC), were estimated on kudzu bug adults. A 
technique developed to evaluate B. bassiana against L. lineolaris was used. 
Younger adults (eight days after collection) were treated with NI8 and GHA and 
older adult (50 days after collection) were treated with NI8, GHA and KUDSC. 
Higher concentrations (n × 10⁶, n × 10⁷) of NI8 and GHA caused kudzu bug 
mortality two days after treatment in younger adults and similar concentrations 
of NI8, GHA, and KUDSC caused mortality one day after treatment in older adults. 
Lower concentrations (n × 10⁴, n × 10⁵) were not significantly different in 
mortality between strains. LS50 values of the KUDSC were significantly lower 
than NI8 and GHA values in older adults. This is the first available information 
on median lethal concentration of B. bassiana on kudzu bug adults bioassayed on 
artificial diet. It was determined that B. bassiana (KUDSC and NI8) are highly 
effective for young adults at very low doses (LC50 1.98-4.98 viable spores per 
mm²).

INTRODUCTION: With increasing life expectancy, curative treatment of 
octogenarians with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) becomes more 
important.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The treatment modalities of 276 octogenarians with UCB 
who were treated at the University Hospital of Erlangen between 1982 and 2011 
were assessed retrospectively.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-six patients had non-muscle invasive bladder cancer 
(NMIBC) while 71 had muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). No data was 
available for 59 patients. Eighty-five (58.2%) of the 146 patients with NMIBC 
received transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) only, another 38 
patients (26%) underwent additional intravesical therapy; and 8.9% were treated 
with radiochemotherapy (RCT), 4.1% with radiotherapy (RT), 1.4% with systemic 
chemotherapy and 1.4% with radical cystectomy (RC). Of the 71 patients suffering 
from MIBC, 39 (54.9%) received TURBT alone. A potentially curative therapy was 
performed on 31 of the 71 patients with MIBC (43.7%). Of these, 16 patients 
(51.6%) received RCT, 9 patients (29.0%) RT and 6 patients (19.4%) RC. In 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with MIBC had better median overall survival 
with curative treatment compared to TURBT alone (28 vs. 9 months; p < 0.001, 
log-rank test).
CONCLUSIONS: By offering a wide range of treatment options, over 43% of 
octogenarians with MIBC received a curative therapy at a maximum care hospital.

BACKGROUND: For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adolescents facing 
lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART), short-cycle therapy (SCT) with 
long-acting agents offers the potential for drug-free weekends, less toxicity, 
better adherence and cost savings.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not efavirenz (EFV)-based ART in short 
cycles of 5 days on and 2 days off is as efficacious (in maintaining virological 
suppression) as continuous EFV-based ART (continuous therapy; CT). Secondary 
objectives included the occurrence of new clinical HIV events or death, changes 
in immunological status, emergence of HIV drug resistance, drug toxicity and 
changes in therapy.
DESIGN: Open, randomised, non-inferiority trial.
SETTING: Europe, Thailand, Uganda, Argentina and the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Young people (aged 8-24 years) on EFV plus two nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors and with a HIV-1 ribonucleic acid level [viral load 
(VL)] of < 50 copies/ml for > 12 months.
INTERVENTIONS: Young people were randomised to continue daily ART (CT) or change 
to SCT (5 days on, 2 days off ART).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Follow-up was for a minimum of 48 weeks (0, 4 and 12 
weeks and then 12-weekly visits). The primary outcome was the difference between 
arms in the proportion with VL > 50 copies/ml (confirmed) by 48 weeks, estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method (12% non-inferiority margin) adjusted for region 
and age.
RESULTS: In total, 199 young people (11 countries) were randomised (n = 99 SCT 
group, n = 100 CT group) and followed for a median of 86 weeks. Overall, 53% 
were male; the median age was 14 years (21% ≥ 18 years); 13% were from the UK, 
56% were black, 19% were Asian and 21% were Caucasian; and the median CD4% and 
CD4 count were 34% and 735 cells/mm(3), respectively. By week 48, only one 
participant (CT) was lost to follow-up. The SCT arm had a 27% decreased drug 
exposure as measured by the adherence questionnaire and a MEMSCap(™) Medication 
Event Monitoring System (MEMSCap Inc., Durham, NC, USA) substudy (median cap 
openings per week: SCT group, n = 5; CT group, n = 7). By 48 weeks, six 
participants in the SCT group and seven in the CT group had a confirmed VL 
> 50 copies/ml [difference -1.2%, 90% confidence interval (CI) -7.3% to 4.9%] 
and two in the SCT group and four in the CT group had a confirmed VL 
> 400 copies/ml (difference -2.1%, 90% CI -6.2% to 1.9%). All six participants 
in the SCT group with a VL > 50 copies/ml resumed daily ART, of whom five were 
resuppressed, three were on the same regimen and two with a switch; two others 
on SCT resumed daily ART for other reasons. Overall, three participants in the 
SCT group and nine in the CT group (p = 0.1) changed ART regimen, five because 
of toxicity, four for simplification reasons, two because of compliance issues 
and one because of VL failure. Seven young people (SCT group, n = 2; CT group, 
n = 5) had major non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations at VL 
failure, of whom two (n = 1 SCT group, n = 1 CT group) had the M184V mutation. 
Two young people had new Centers for Disease Control B events (SCT group, n = 1; 
CT group, n = 1). There were no significant differences between SCT and CT in 
grade 3/4 adverse events (13 vs. 14) or in serious adverse events (7 vs. 6); 
there were fewer ART-related adverse events in the SCT arm (2 vs. 14; p = 0.02). 
At week 48 there was no evidence that SCT led to increased inflammation using an 
extensive panel of markers. Young people expressed a strong preference for SCT 
in a qualitative substudy and in pre- and post-trial questionnaires. In total, 
98% of the young people are taking part in a 2-year follow-up extension of the 
trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-inferiority of VL suppression in young people on EFV-based 
first-line ART with a VL of < 50 copies/ml was demonstrated for SCT compared 
with CT, with similar resistance, safety and inflammatory marker profiles. The 
SCT group had fewer ART-related adverse events. Further evaluation of the 
immunological and virological impact of SCT is ongoing. A limitation of the 
trial is that the results cannot be generalised to settings where VL monitoring 
is either not available or infrequent, nor to use of low-dose EFV. Two-year 
extended follow-up of the trial is ongoing to confirm the durability of the SCT 
strategy. Further trials of SCT in settings with infrequent VL monitoring and 
with other antiretroviral drugs such as tenofovir alafenamide, which has a long 
intracellular half-life, and/or dolutegravir, which has a higher barrier to 
resistance, are planned.

BACKGROUND: The Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is characterized by a set of risk 
factors, which causes metabolic and inflammatory changes that increase vascular 
risk and may promote the development of atherosclerosis. Changes in lifestyle 
are related to obesity and associated diseases such as hypertension, type 2 
diabetes mellitus, MS and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of MS components and high 
sensitivity C Reactive Protein (hsCRP) in patients undergoing arteriography.
METHODS: A group of patients undergoing arteriography was recruited in order we 
could evaluate the metabolic profile, levels of hsCRP and number of obstructions 
in the arteries.
RESULTS: Most of our patients underwent arteriography are more likely to have 
hypertension, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and central obesity, thus, MS 
is prevalent in this group. They also tend to exhibit higher values of hsCRP, 
lower values ​​for the estimative of the size of the LDL-c particle and higher 
number of obstruction in the arteries.
CONCLUSION: We may say that the improvement of the above parameters could reduce 
inflammation and oxidative stress and vascular damages what would extend life 
expectancy and quality of life of this group of patients.

PURPOSE: It is unknown whether maximal voluntary co-contraction of abdominal 
muscles, called abdominal bracing, can be a training maneuver for improving 
strength and power of trunk and lower limb muscles. The present study aimed to 
elucidate this.
METHODS: Twenty young adult men (23.3 ± 1.8 years) were allocated to training 
(TG, n = 11) or control (CG, n = 9) group. TG conducted an 8-week training 
program (3 days/week) consisting of 2-s maximal abdominal bracing followed by 
2-s muscle relaxation (5 × 10 repetitions/day). Maximal voluntary isometric 
strength during trunk flexion and extension, hip extension, and knee extension, 
maximal lifting power from sitting position, and the thicknesses of abdominal 
muscles were measured before and after the intervention. In addition, surface 
electromyograms from trunk and lower limb muscles and intra-abdominal pressure 
(IAP) during the maximal abdominal bracing and maximal lifting tasks were also 
determined.
RESULTS: After the intervention, TG showed significant increases in isometric 
trunk extension (+14.4 %) and hip extension (+34.7 %) strength and maximal 
lifting power (+15.6 %), while CG did not show any changes in strength and power 
variables. Furthermore, TG had significant gains in the muscle thickness of the 
oblique internal (+22.4 %), maximal IAP during abdominal bracing (+36.8 %), and 
the rate of IAP rise during lifting task (+58.8 %), without corresponding 
changes in CG.
CONCLUSION: The current study indicates that a training style with maximal 
voluntary co-contraction of abdominal muscles can be an effective maneuver for 
increasing strength and power during movements involving trunk and hip 
extensions, without using external load.

Metastatic cancer remains a devastating disease that threatens to disrupt entire 
family structures creating economic and psychosocial stress. Fortunately, great 
strides have resulted in improved therapies over the years but at a huge 
social-economic cost. The economic burden has risen greatly and carries with it 
new ethical concerns when deciding treatment. Here, we discuss the financial and 
ethical challenges that oncologists and their patients face in the era of novel 
treatment strategies. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;114:323-328. © 2016 Wiley
