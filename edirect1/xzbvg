OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the effects of prolonged release 
oxycodone/naloxone (OXN PR) on sleep and quality of life (QoL) in patients with 
severe restless legs syndrome (RLS) refractory to first-line dopaminergic RLS 
treatment.
METHODS: Sleep and QoL data from a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study with subsequent 40-week, open-label extension were 
analyzed. Instruments included the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) sleep scale, 
RLS-6 rating scale, and RLS-QoL questionnaire.
RESULTS: The full analysis population included 132 OXN PR and 144 placebo 
patients. After 12 treatment weeks, improvements in the MOS domains 'sleep 
disturbance' [-18.6; 95 % confidence interval (CI) -24.4 to -12.9; p < 0.0001], 
'sleep adequacy' (14.9; 95 % CI 7.9-21.9; p < 0.0001), and 'sleep quantity' 
(0.77 h; 95 % CI 0.43-1.11; p < 0.0001) were significantly greater under OXN PR 
than under placebo. OXN PR also reduced symptom severity (when falling asleep 
and during the night) and daytime tiredness, and increased sleep satisfaction to 
a significantly greater extent than placebo (all p < 0.001; RLS-6). QoL improved 
in both treatment arms, with a significant difference of -9.02 (95 % CI -12.85 
to -5.19; p < 0.001) in the mean sum score in favor of OXN PR. All sleep and QoL 
aspects also improved under 40 weeks of open-label OXN PR treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: OXN PR improved RLS symptom severity and sleep quantity and 
adequacy, resulting in greater sleep satisfaction, less daytime tiredness, and 
improved QoL. In appropriate patients, OXN PR should be considered as an 
alternative treatment option for severe RLS that cannot be controlled by 
first-line dopaminergic medications.

BACKGROUND: Management of low-grade oral dysplasias (LGDs) is complicated, as 
only a small percentage of lesions will progress to invasive disease. The 
current standard of care requires patients to undergo regular monitoring of 
their lesions, with intervention occurring as a response to meaningful clinical 
changes. Recent improvements in molecular technologies and understanding of the 
biology of LGDs may allow clinicians to manage lesions based on their 
genome-guided risk.
METHODS: We used a decision-analytic Markov model to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified care using a genomic assay. In the 
experimental arm, patients with LGDs were managed according to their risk 
profile using the assay, with low- and intermediate-risk patients given longer 
screening intervals and high-risk patients immediately treated with surgery. 
Patients in the comparator arm had standard care (biannual follow-up 
appointments at an oral cancer clinic). Incremental costs and outcomes in 
life-years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were calculated 
based on the results in each arm.
RESULTS: The mean cost of assay-guided management was $8,123 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] $2,973 to $23,062 in 2013 Canadian dollars) less than the cost of 
standard care. This difference was driven largely by reductions in resource use 
among people who did not develop cancer. Mean incremental effectiveness was 0.18 
LYG (95% CI 0.08 to 0.39) or 0.64 QALY (95% CI 0.46 to 0.89). Sensitivity 
analysis suggests that these findings are robust to both expected and extreme 
variation in all parameter values.
CONCLUSION: Use of the assay-guided management strategy costs less and is more 
effective than standard management of LGDs.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this study strongly suggest that the 
use of a risk-stratification method such as a genomic assay can result in 
improved quality-adjusted survival outcomes for patients with low-grade oral 
dysplasia (LGD). The use of such an assay in this study provides "precision 
medicine," allowing for a change in follow-up frequency or early intervention as 
compared with current standard care. As genomic technologies become more common 
in cancer care, it is hoped that such an assay, once validated, will become part 
of a new model for the standard management of LGDs in similar health systems.

Both the complexity of clinically applied tissue engineering techniques for 
articular cartilage repair - such as autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) - 
plus increasing healthcare costs, and market competition, are forcing a shift in 
focus from two-stage to single-stage interventions that are more cost-effective. 
Early health economic models are expected to provide essential insight in the 
parameters driving the cost-effectiveness of new interventions before they are 
introduced into clinical practice. The present study estimated the likely 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a new investigator-driven 
single-stage procedure (IMPACT) compared with both microfracture and ACI, and 
identified those parameters that affect the cost-effectiveness. A decision tree 
with clinical health states was constructed. The ICER was calculated by dividing 
the incremental societal costs by the incremental Quality Adjusted Life Years 
(QALYs). Costs were determined from a societal perspective. A headroom analysis 
was performed to determine the maximum price of IMPACT compared with both ACI 
and microfracture, assuming a societal willingness to pay (WTP) of €30 000/QALY. 
One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to identify those parameters that 
drive the cost-effectiveness. The societal costs of IMPACT, ACI and 
microfracture were found to be €11 797, €29 741 and €6081, respectively. An 8% 
increase in all utilities after IMPACT changes the ICER of IMPACT vs. 
microfracture from €147 513/QALY to €28 588/QALY. Compared with ACI, IMPACT is 
less costly, which is largely attributable to the cell expansion procedure that 
has been rendered redundant. While microfracture can be considered the most 
cost-effective treatment option for smaller defects, a single-stage tissue 
engineering procedure can replace ACI to improve the cost-effectiveness for 
treating larger defects, especially if clinical non-inferiority can be achieved.

Current understanding of life-history evolution and how demographic parameters 
contribute to population dynamics across species is largely based on assumptions 
of either constant environments or stationary environmental variation. 
Meanwhile, species are faced with non-stationary environmental conditions 
(changing mean, variance, or both) created by climate and landscape change. To 
close the gap between contemporary reality and demographic theory, we develop a 
set of transient life table response experiments (LTREs) for decomposing 
realised population growth rates into contributions from specific vital rates 
and components of population structure. Using transient LTREs in a theoretical 
framework, we reveal that established concepts in population biology will 
require revision because of reliance on approaches that do not address the 
influence of unstable population structure on population growth and mean 
fitness. Going forward, transient LTREs will enhance understanding of demography 
and improve the explanatory power of models used to understand ecological and 
evolutionary dynamics.

Human life expectancy is influenced not only by longevity assurance mechanisms 
and disease susceptibility loci but also by the environment, gene-environment 
interactions, and chance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs 
closely related to genes. Circulating miRNAs have been shown as promising 
noninvasive biomarkers in the development of many pathophysiological conditions. 
However, the concentration of miRNA in the circulation may also be affected by 
environmental factors. We used a next-generation sequencing platform to assess 
the association of circulating miRNA with life expectancy, for which deaths are 
due to all causes independent of genes. In addition, we showed that miRNAs are 
present in 41-year archived plasma samples, which may be useful for both life 
expectancy and all-cause mortality risk assessment. Plasma miRNAs from nine 
identical male twins were profiled using next-generation sequencing. The average 
absolute difference in the minimum life expectancy was 9.68 years. Intraclass 
correlation coefficients were above 0.4 for 50% of miRNAs. Comparing deceased 
twins with their alive co-twin brothers, the concentrations were increased for 
34 but decreased for 30 miRNAs. Identical twins discordant in life expectancy 
were dissimilar in the majority of miRNAs, suggesting that environmental factors 
are pivotal in miRNAs related to life expectancy.

Mammals feature not only great phenotypic disparity, but also diverse growth and 
life history patterns, especially in maturity level at birth, ranging from 
altriciality to precocity. Gestation length, morphology at birth, and other 
markers of life history are fundamental to our understanding of mammalian 
evolution. Based on the first synthesis of embryological data and the study of 
new ontogenetic series, we reconstructed estimates of the ancestral chronology 
of organogenesis and life-history modes in placental mammals. We found that the 
ancestor of marsupial and placental mammals was placental-like at birth but had 
a long, marsupial-like infancy. We hypothesize that mammalian viviparity might 
have evolved in association with the extension of growth after birth, enabled 
through lactation, and that mammalian altriciality is inherited from the 
earliest amniotes. The precocial lifestyle of extant sauropsids and that of many 
placental mammals were acquired secondarily. We base our conclusions on the best 
estimates and provide a comprehensive discussion on the methods used and the 
limitations of our dataset. We provide the most comprehensive embryological 
dataset ever published, "rescue" old literature sources, and apply available 
methods and illustrate thus an approach on how to investigate comparatively 
organogenesis in macroevolution.

The Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome project (FANTOM5) mapped 
transcription start sites (TSSs) and measured their activities in a diverse 
range of biological samples. The FANTOM5 project generated a large data set; 
including detailed information about the profiled samples, the uncovered TSSs at 
high base-pair resolution on the genome, their transcriptional initiation 
activities, and further information of transcriptional regulation. Data sets to 
explore transcriptome in individual cellular states encoded in the mammalian 
genomes have been enriched by a series of additional analysis, based on the raw 
experimental data, along with the progress of the research activities. To make 
the heterogeneous data set accessible and useful for investigators, we developed 
a web-based database called Semantic catalog of Samples, Transcription 
initiation And Regulators (SSTAR). SSTAR utilizes the open source wiki software 
MediaWiki along with the Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) extension, which provides 
flexibility to model, store, and display a series of data sets produced during 
the course of the FANTOM5 project. Our use of SMW demonstrates the utility of 
the framework for dissemination of large-scale analysis results. SSTAR is a case 
study in handling biological data generated from a large-scale research project 
in terms of maintenance and growth alongside research activities.Database URL:

Efforts to understand the dramatic declines in mortality over the past century 
have focused on life expectancy. However, understanding changes in disparity in 
age of death is important to understanding mechanisms of mortality improvement 
and devising policy to promote health equity. We derive a novel decomposition of 
variance in age of death, a measure of inequality, and apply it to 
cause-specific contributions to the change in variance among the G7 countries 
(Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States) from 1950 to 2010. We find that the causes of death that contributed 
most to declines in the variance are different from those that contributed most 
to increase in life expectancy; in particular, they affect mortality at younger 
ages. We also find that, for two leading causes of death [cancers and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD)], there are no consistent relationships between 
changes in life expectancy and variance either within countries over time or 
between countries. These results show that promoting health at younger ages is 
critical for health equity and that policies to control cancer and CVD may have 
differing implications for equity.

Functional studies of human neutrophils and their transfusion for clinical 
purposes have been hampered by their short life span after isolation. Here, we 
demonstrate that neutrophil viability is maintained for 20 hours in culture 
media at 37°C under anoxic conditions with 3 mM glucose and 32 μg/mL 
dimethyloxalylglycine supplementation, as evidenced by stabilization of Mcl-1, 
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and pro-caspase-3. Notably, 
neutrophil morphology (nucleus shape and cell-surface markers) and functions 
(phagocytosis, degranulation, calcium release, chemotaxis, and reactive oxygen 
species production) were comparable to blood circulating neutrophils. The 
observed extension in neutrophil viability was reversed upon exposure to oxygen. 
Extending neutrophil life span allowed efficient transfection of plasmids (40% 
transfection efficiency) and short interfering RNA (interleukin-8, PCNA, and 
Bax), as a validation of effective and functional genetic manipulation of 
neutrophils both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, transfusion of conditioned 
neutrophils in a neutropenic guinea pig model increased bacterial clearance of 
Shigella flexneri upon colonic infection, strongly suggesting that these 
conditioned neutrophils might be suitable for transfusion purposes. In summary, 
such conditioning of neutrophils in vitro should facilitate their study and 
offer new opportunities for genetic manipulation and therapeutic use.

Breast cancer (BC) is diagnosed in ≥ 65 year old women in about half of cases. 
Experts currently recommend that systemic therapy is offered to elderly patients 
with BC, if, based on their overall conditions and life expectancy, it can be 
reasonably anticipated that the benefits will outweigh the risks of treatment. 
Like for young subjects, the monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth 
factor receptor-2 (HER-2), trastuzumab, represents a valid therapeutic option 
when BC over-expresses this receptor. Unfortunately, administration of 
trastuzumab is associated with the occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction 
and chronic heart failure (CHF), possibly because of interference with the 
homeostatic functions of HER-2 in the heart. Registry-based, retrospective 
analyses have reported an incidence of CHF around 25% in elderly women receiving 
trastuzumab compared with 10%-15% in those not given any therapy for BC, and the 
risk of CHF has been estimated to be two-fold higher in > 60-65 year old 
trastuzumab users vs. non-users. Extremely advanced age and preexisting cardiac 
disease have been shown to predispose to trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Therefore, 
selection of older patients for treatment with trastuzumab should be primarily 
based on their general status and the presence of comorbidities; previous 
chemotherapy, especially with anthracyclines, should be also taken into account. 
Once therapy has started, efforts should be made to ensure regular cardiac 
surveillance. The role of selected biomarkers, such as cardiac troponin, or new 
imaging techniques (three-dimension, tissue Doppler echocardiography, magnetic 
resonance imaging) is promising, but must be further investigated especially in 
the elderly. Moreover, additional studies are needed in order to better 
understand the mechanisms by which trastuzumab affects the old heart.

As life expectancy increases, health in the elderly is a growing issue. Health 
is linked to remaining socially active, but the elderly typically narrow their 
social networks. The social life of aging monkeys shows interesting parallels, 
indicating social patterns may be rooted in evolution.

BACKGROUND: Although major guidelines uniformly recommend iron supplementation 
and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) for managing chronic anemia in 
persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD), there are differences in the 
recommended hemoglobin (Hb) treatment target and no guidelines consider the 
costs or cost-effectiveness of treatment. In this study, we explored the most 
cost-effective Hb target for anemia treatment in persons with CKD stages 3-4.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The CKD Health Policy Model was populated with a synthetic 
cohort of persons over age 30 with prevalent CKD stages 3-4 (i.e., not on 
dialysis) and anemia created from the 1999-2010 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), computed as 
incremental cost divided by incremental quality adjusted life years (QALYs), 
were assessed for Hb targets of 10 g/dl to 13 g/dl at 0.5 g/dl increments. 
Targeting a Hb of 10 g/dl resulted in an ICER of $32,111 compared with no 
treatment and targeting a Hb of 10.5 g/dl resulted in an ICER of $32,475 
compared with a Hb target of 10 g/dl. QALYs increased to 4.63 for a Hb target of 
10 g/dl and to 4.75 for a target of 10.5 g/dl or 11 g/dl. Any treatment target 
above 11 g/dl increased medical costs and decreased QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: In persons over age 30 with CKD stages 3-4, anemia treatment is 
most cost-effective when targeting a Hb level of 10.5 g/dl. This study provides 
important information for framing guidelines related to treatment of anemia in 
persons with CKD.

The Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV) is the government 
body responsible for deciding whether outpatient drugs are to be included in the 
pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This paper analyzed all decisions made by TLV 
between 2005 and 2011 in order to investigate how the cost-effectiveness of a 
drug and the severity of the disease the drug targets affected the likelihood of 
subsidy of a drug. We find that TLV places significant weight on both the 
cost-effectiveness, measured as the cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY), 
and disease severity. We also find that the higher cost per QALY approved for 
severe diseases is mainly represented by cancer drugs. Drugs targeting severe 
diseases other than cancer have a similar cost per QALY as for non-severe 
diseases.

[Body Mass Index makes headlines - When is mortality rate lowest?].

[Article in German]

Weigl J, Holzapfel C.

"People with obesity live longer" - headlines like these are common. Recently 
published epidemiological studies however provide new food for thought: how is a 
body mass index (BMI) in the overweight range associated with total mortality? 
There are many studies showing that a BMI outside the normal range is associated 
with a higher total mortality. In contrast, there are indications that a BMI in 
the overweight range is associated with a lower mortality rate. These 
observations should be interpreted with caution, because of the limitations of 
the BMI as a measure of overweight and obesity and because the results are based 
on cohort data. There is currently no reason to deviate from the recommendations 
regarding the indications for weight loss of the German Obesity Association.

A superior life expectancy and an increased activity in the population result in 
an increase in degenerative diseases, such as Achilles tendon ruptures. The 
medical history and physical examinations are the methods of choice to diagnose 
Achilles tendon ruptures. Ultrasound and radiography represent reasonable 
extended diagnostic procedures. In order to decide on the medical indications 
for the therapy concept, the advantages and disadvantages of conservative and 
surgical treatment options have to be weighed up on an indivdual basis. There 
are explicit contraindications for both treatment options. For the surgical 
treatment concept open suture techniques, minimally invasive methods and 
reconstructive procedures are available. The postoperative management of the 
patient is as important as the choice of surgical technique. With the correct 
medical indications and supervision of the patient it is possible to achieve 
extremely satisfying results for the patient with both conservative and surgical 
treatment options.

[We are living longer, but are these additional years spent in good health?].

[Article in Dutch]

Geneeskunde, Amsterdam.

Life expectancy in western countries has increased continuously over recent 
years. The issue at stake is if this rise includes healthy years. The answer 
depends on the health indicator used, e.g., perceived health, disability, or 
cognitive impairment. A study by Jagger et al. (2016) provides evidence for an 
increase in life expectancy without cognitive impairment and an absolute 
compression of cognitive impairment between 1991 and 2011. Information on life 
expectancy without cognitive impairment is not yet available for the 
Netherlands. Similar to England, Dutch trends in life expectancy in excellent or 
good self-perceived health and in life expectancy without severe disability are 
favourable, although less pronouncedly so. Dutch and English data suggest that 
the additional years lived by the population are at least partly spent in good 
health.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
the fixed-dose combination (FDC) of tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat(®) FDC with 
tiotropium alone for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
in the Italian health care setting using a newly developed patient-level Markov 
model that reflects the current understanding of the disease.
METHODS: While previously published models have largely been based around a 
cohort approach using a Markov structure and GOLD stage stratification, an 
individual-level Markov approach was selected for the new model. Using 
patient-level data from the twin TOnado trials assessing Tiotropium + olodaterol 
Respimat(®) FDC versus tiotropium, outcomes were modelled based on the trough 
forced expiratory volume (tFEV1) of over 1000 patients in each treatment arm, 
tracked individually at trial visits through the 52-week trial period, and after 
the trial period it was assumed to decline at a constant rate based on disease 
stage. Exacerbation risk was estimated based on a random-effects logistic 
regression analysis of exacerbations in UPLIFT. Mortality by age and disease 
stage was estimated from an analysis of TIOSPIR trial data. Cost of 
bronchodilators and other medications, routine management, and costs of 
treatment for moderate and severe exacerbations for the Italian setting were 
included. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted over a 15-year time 
horizon from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service.
RESULTS: Aggregating total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 
each treatment cohort over 15 years and comparing tiotropium + olodaterol 
Respimat(®) FDC with tiotropium alone, resulted in mean incremental costs per 
patient of €1167 and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €7518 per 
additional QALY with tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat(®) FDC. The lung function 
outcomes observed for tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat(®) FDC in TOnado drove 
the results in terms of slightly higher mean life-years (12.24 versus 12.07) 
exacerbation-free months (11.36 versus 11.32) per patient and slightly fewer 
moderate and severe exacerbations per patient-year (0.411 versus 0.415; 0.21 
versus 0.24) versus tiotropium. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed 
tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat(®) FDC to be the more cost-effective treatment 
in 95.2% and 98.4% of 500 simulations at thresholds of €20,000 and €30,000 per 
QALY respectively.
CONCLUSION: Tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat(®) FDC is a cost-effective 
bronchodilator in the maintenance treatment of COPD for the Italian health care 
system.

Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by 
microvascular injury and diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. While 
macrovascular disease and higher risk for cardiovascular events are well 
documented in other systemic rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and 
systemic lupus erythematosus, the presence and extent of atherosclerosis among 
patients with SSc is yet to be established. Primary cardiac involvement, due to 
impairment of coronary microvascular circulation and myocardial fibrosis, 
considerably affects prognosis and life expectancy of individuals with SSc, 
representing one of the leading causes of death in this population. On the other 
hand the existence and prevalence of atherosclerotic coronary disease remains an 
issue of debate as studies comparing structural and morphological markers of 
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events between SSc patients and the general 
population have yielded controversial results. The aim of this review is to 
summarize recent literature about the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in 
SSc, review the surrogate markers of CVD that have been evaluated and examine 
whether common pathogenic mechanisms exist between SSc and macrovascular 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplants, alongside enzyme replacement 
therapy and good multi-disciplinary care, have dramatically improved the life 
expectancy in children with Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) I, with better objective 
and functional outcomes. Despite these improvements, children with both the 
attenuated (non-Hurler) and severe (Hurler) variants of the disease have marked 
residual morbidity. Children with MPS I suffer with head and neck disease 
including obstructive sleep apnoea and hearing loss. The impact of these on 
quality of life has been poorly researched and no previous work has been 
published looking at patients' perception of their own health, an important 
domain when considering the impact of treatment.
METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study aimed to discover the effect of head 
and neck disease, alongside that of MPS I as a whole, on the quality of life of 
affected children. A grounded theory approach was used to conduct this study. 
Children and their parents were invited to participate in semi-structured 
interviews. The transcribed interviews were coded and emergent themes explored 
until saturation occurred.
RESULTS: The families of eleven children with MPS I were interviewed, five with 
Hurler's and six with the attenuated non-Hurler's. Important themes to emerge 
were- the fear of dying associated with obstructive sleep apnoea, difficulties 
communicating at school due to the delayed acquisition of language, chronic pain 
and restricted mobility, physical differences and restricted participation in 
social activities such as sports secondary to the musculoskeletal disease 
burden. The overall theme running through the analysis was the desire to fit in 
with ones peers.
CONCLUSION: Parents and children with MPS 1 worry about 'fitting-in' with 
broader society. The presence of airway disease has a profound impact on the 
emotional well being of parents whilst language delay and musculoskeletal 
disease have the biggest impact on the quality of life of the children 
themselves. It is important to understand the impact of MPS I on the quality of 
life of children and their families so that we may improve future treatment and 
management of this sub-group of children who have an increasing life span.

BACKGROUND: Although the acute hospital setting is not considered to be an ideal 
place of death, many people are admitted to hospital at the end of life.
AIM: To examine what proportion of terminal hospital admissions among their 
patients family physicians consider to have been avoidable and/or inappropriate; 
which patient, family physician and admission factors are associated with the 
perceived inappropriateness or avoidability of terminal hospital admissions; and 
which interventions could have prevented them, from the perspective of family 
physicians.
DESIGN: Survey among family physicians, linked to medical record data.
SETTING: Patients who had died non-suddenly in the acute hospital setting of a 
university hospital in Belgium between January and August 2014.
RESULTS: We received 245 completed questionnaires (response rate 70%) and 77% of 
those hospital deaths ( n = 189) were considered to be non-sudden. Almost 14% of 
all terminal hospital admissions were considered to be potentially 
inappropriate, almost 14% potentially avoidable and 8% both, according to family 
physicians. The terminal hospital admission was more likely to be considered 
potentially inappropriate or potentially avoidable for patients who had died of 
cancer, when the patient's life expectancy at the time of admission was limited, 
by family physicians who had had palliative care training at basic, postgraduate 
or post-academic level, and when the admission was initiated by the patient, 
partner or other family.
CONCLUSION: Timely communication with the patient about their limited life 
expectancy and the provision of better support to family caregivers may be 
important strategies in reducing the number of hospital deaths.

BACKGROUND: Extended-release niacin with laropiprant did not significantly 
reduce the risk of major vascular events and increased the risk of serious 
adverse events in Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the 
Incidence of Vascular Events (HPS2-THRIVE), but its net effects on health and 
healthcare costs are unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: 25 673 participants aged 50 to 80 years with previous 
cardiovascular disease were randomized to 2 g of extended-release niacin with 40 
mg of laropiprant daily versus matching placebo, in addition to effective 
statin-based low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering treatment. The net 
effects of niacin-laropiprant on quality-adjusted life years and hospital care 
costs (2012 UK £; converted into US $ using purchasing power parity index) 
during 4 years in HPS2-THRIVE were evaluated using estimates of the impact of 
serious adverse events on health-related quality of life and hospital care 
costs. During the study, participants assigned niacin-laropiprant experienced 
marginally but not statistically significantly lower survival (0.012 fewer years 
[standard error (SE) 0.007]), fewer quality-adjusted life years (0.023 [SE 
0.007] fewer using UK EQ-5D scores; 0.020 [SE 0.006] fewer using US EQ-5D 
scores) and accrued greater hospital costs (UK £101 [SE £37]; US $145 [SE $53]). 
Stroke, heart failure, musculoskeletal events, gastrointestinal events, and 
infections were associated with significant decreases in health-related quality 
of life in both the year of the event and in subsequent years. All serious 
vascular and nonvascular events were associated with substantial increases in 
hospital care costs.
CONCLUSIONS: In HPS2-THRIVE, the addition of extended-release niacin-laropiprant 
to statin-based therapy reduced quality of life-adjusted survival and increased 
hospital costs.

medicine has not been able to deny the inevitability of death. Slowly but 
surely, the approach towards death is changing with increasing emphasis on 
various end of life care decisions. Many of these decisions are being actively
