BACKGROUND: Most preference-based instruments producing overall values for 
health states are devised on the simplifying assumption that the overall effect 
of distinct health-related quality of life domains (attributes) of the 
instrument equals the sum of the attributes. Nevertheless, health attributes are 
often inter-related and depend on each other.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether inclusion of second-order interactions in the 
three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) value function 
would result in better fit and lead to different health state values than a 
model with main effects only.
METHODS: Using an efficient design, 400 pairs of EQ-5D-3L health states were 
generated in a pairwise choice format. We analyzed responses of 4000 people from 
the general population using a conditional logit model, and we tested goodness 
of fit using pseudo R2, Akaike information criterion, differences in 
log-likelihood, and likelihood ratio. We compared accuracies of models' 
predictions based on root mean square error and mean absolute error.
RESULTS: The interaction-effects model showed systematically lower values than 
the main-effects model. Inclusion of interactions resulted only in a slightly 
better model fit. Interactions comprising mobility and self-care were the most 
salient.
CONCLUSIONS: For the EQ-5D-3L, a value function based on interactions produces 
systematically lower values than a main-effects model, meaning that the effect 
of two or more health problems combined is stronger than the sum of the 
individual main effects.

In last years, following the increased canine life expectancy and the rising 
attention pet-owners devote to their animals, several authors have carried on 
investigations concerning new techniques to early identify canine prostatic 
disorders that might affect the dog's quality of life. Prostatic disorders often 
have an asymptomatic onset and their early diagnosis is difficult: hence, they 
are usually identified at an advanced stage, only. Traditionally, the diagnosis 
of prostatic disorders is based on noninvasive tools, such as transrectal and 
abdominal palpation, seminal or prostatic fluid evaluation, and urinalysis and 
imaging. On the other hand, a definite diagnosis of prostatic abnormalities 
could be achieved through prostatic parenchyma Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) or 
biopsy. However, these investigations are performed rarely because of their 
invasiveness. Thus, several authors investigated canine serum biomarkers in 
order to achieve an earlier diagnostic timing and to apply therapeutic 
strategies for better outcomes. The Canine Prostatic Specific Esterase (CPSE) 
has been identified as a suitable biomarker to be included in a prostate health 
screening program, following the model of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in 
human medicine. A higher CPSE in dogs suffering from several prostatic diseases, 
such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, bacterial prostatitis, or prostatic 
carcinoma, was reported in literature. Thanks to the potential usefulness in 
clinical practice, further studies should investigate the potential role of CPSE 
in monitoring the medical treatment success in the male reproductive system. 
Moreover, the spreading availability of serum biomarkers, easily carried out on 
blood samples in clinical practice, could assure a more accurate evaluation of 
the actual prevalence of prostatic disorders. The CPSE is actually recognized as 
a promising diagnostic tool for the detection of prostatic disorders in a 
"prostate health screening program," in order to properly select those patients 
requiring further more accurate and expensive diagnostic investigations.

When, how, and following which paths hominins created the innovations that 
allowed them to colonize regions of the planet that were not suited to their 
thermal physiology is still a matter of inquiry. In this paper, we elaborate a 
theoretical framework to investigate the origin and diversification of bone 
needles, summarize the evidence for their emergence, create a large database of 
their morphometric and stylistic characters, and present results of the study of 
an exceptionally well-preserved collection of needles from Shuidonggou Locality 
12 (SDG12), a site located in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Northern China, 
dated to ca. 11.2 ka BP. Bone needles are reported from 271 sites and 355 
archaeological layers. Revision of the evidence shows they represent an original 
cultural innovation that emerged in Eurasia between 45-40 ka BP. Size 
differences between the earliest known specimens, found in Siberia and China, 
indicate needles may have been invented independently in these two regions. 
Needles from Eastern Europe may represent either an independent invention or a 
geographic extension of earlier Siberian and Caucasian sewing traditions. In 
Western Europe, needles appear during the Solutrean. The wider size range 
characteristic of Magdalenian specimens supports the idea that needles of 
different sizes were used in a variety of tasks. In China, the robust 
sub-circular needles found at sites dated between 35-25 ka BP are followed, 
between 26-23 ka BP, by small flat needles, which may represent an innovation 
associated with the microblades/microcores toolkit. At SDG12, technological, 
functional, and morphometric analyses of finished needles and manufacturing 
by-products identify two previously undetected reduction sequences for the 
production of needles of different size and, probably, function. The bone 
needles found at Paleoindian sites are the smallest and reflect a never 
previously achieved mastery in the production of such tools.

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study measures the health of populations 
worldwide and by country on an annual basis and aims at helping guide public 
policy on health issues. The GBD estimates for Spain in 2016 and recent trends 
in mortality and morbidity from 2006 to 2016 were recently published. According 
to these estimates, chronic kidney disease was the 8th cause of death in Spain 
in 2016. Among the top ten causes of death, chronic kidney disease was the 
fastest growing from 2006 to 2016, after Alzheimer disease. At the current pace 
of growth, chronic kidney disease is set to become the second cause of death in 
Spain, after Alzheimer disease, by 2100. Additionally, among major causes of 
death, chronic kidney disease also ranked second only to Alzheimer as the 
fastest growing cause of Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) and Disability 
Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Public resources devoted to prevention, care and 
research on kidney disease should be in line with both its current and future 
burden.

Carotenoid pigments are valuable components of the human diet. A notable example 
is β-carotene, or provitamin A, which is converted into the derivatives 
astaxanthin and capsanthin, via the common intermediate zeaxanthin. To generate 
rice varieties producing diverse carotenoids beyond β-carotene, we specifically 
used a Capsicum β-carotene hydroxylase gene, B (CaBch) and a codon optimized 
version of the same gene, stB (stBch) to increase zeaxanthin synthesis. We also 
used a recombinant BAK gene (CaBch-2A-HpBkt), consisting of the CaBch sequence 
and a Haematococcus β-carotene ketolase gene (HpBkt) linked by a bicistronic 2 A 
sequence, as well as a codon optimized recombinant stBAK gene (stBch-2A-stBkt) 
to create astaxanthin synthesis. The four cassettes to seed-specifically express 
the B, stB, BAK and stBAK genes were individually combined with a PAC gene 
(CaPsy-2A-PaCrtI) cassette to previously impart β-carotene-enriched trait in 
rice endosperm. The single T-DNA vectors of B-PAC, stB-PAC, BAK-PAC and 
stBAK-PAC resulted in the accumulation of zeaxanthin and astaxanthin in the 
endosperm of the transgenic rice seeds. In addition, an extended version on the 
carotenoid pathway was introduced into rice to allow the production of 
capsanthin, by intercrossing a B-PAC rice line with a Ccs rice line, which 
harbors a Capsicum capsanthin-capsorubin synthase gene. Ultimately, we developed 
three functional rice varieties: B-PAC (0.8 μg/g zeaxanthin, deep yellow), 
stBAK-PAC (1.4 μg/g ketocarotenoids, including astaxanthin, pinkish red) and 
B-PAC x Ccs (0.4 μg/g of ketoxanthophylls, including capsanthin, orange-red) 
with the similar levels of total carotenoids to PAC rice, suggesting the 
capacity was dependent on β-carotene levels. Collectively, a combination of 
genetic engineering and conventional breeding is effective for multi-step 
metabolic engineering and biochemical pathway extension.

Beyond transfusion therapy: new therapies in thalassemia including drugs, 
alternate donor transplant, and gene therapy.

Porter J(1).

Transfusion combined with chelation therapy for severe β thalassemia syndromes 
(transfusion-dependent thalassemia [TDT]) has been successful in extending life 
expectancy, decreasing comorbidities and improving quality of life. However, 
this puts lifelong demands not only on the patients but also on the health care 
systems that are tasked with delivering long-term treatment and comprehensive 
support. Prevention programs and curative approaches are therefore an important 
part of overall strategy. Curative treatments alter the dynamic of a patient's 
health care costs, from financial commitment over 50 years, into a potential 
"one-off" investment. Since the 1980s, this has usually been available only to 
the 30% or so of young children with matched sibling donors. By improving the 
safety of matched related donors and haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell 
transplants, the potential size of the donor pool for curative therapies may be 
increased. Recent advances in gene therapy demonstrate that even patients 
lacking a matched donor can be rendered transfusion independent with an 
autograft of genetically modified autologous stem cells, with a low short-term 
risk. Noncurative treatments are also of potential value by decreasing use of 
blood and chelators and decreasing hospital visits. An example is luspatercept, 
an activin-receptor trap that modifies transforming growth factor-β signaling, 
thereby increasing the efficiency of erythropoiesis. This has entered phase 3 
clinical trials for TDT and non-TDT and, usefully increases in both Hb and 
quality of life in non-TDT as well as decreasing transfusion requirements in 
TDT. Other novel noncurative treatments are entering clinical trials such 
improvement of erythropoiesis through pharmacological manipulation of hepcidin 
and iron metabolism.

TUSKEGEE AND THE HEALTH OF BLACK MEN.

JEL Codes: I14, O15 For forty years, the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in 
the Negro Male passively monitored hundreds of adult black males with syphilis 
despite the availability of effective treatment. The study's methods have become 
synonymous with exploitation and mistreatment by the medical profession. To 
identify the study's effects on the behavior and health of older black men, we 
use an interacted difference-in-difference-in-differences model, comparing older 
black men to other demographic groups, before and after the Tuskegee revelation, 
in varying proximity to the study's victims. We find that the disclosure of the 
study in 1972 is correlated with increases in medical mistrust and mortality and 
decreases in both outpatient and inpatient physician interactions for older 
black men. Our estimates imply life expectancy at age 45 for black men fell by 
up to 1.5 years in response to the disclosure, accounting for approximately 35% 
of the 1980 life expectancy gap between black and white men and 25% of the gap 
between black men and women.

Estimation of the National Burden of Disease and Vulnerable Population 
Associated with Natural Disasters in Korea: Heavy Precipitation and Typhoon.

of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.

BACKGROUND: Despite its growing significance, studies on the burden of disease 
associated with natural disasters from the perspective of public health were 
few. This study aimed at estimating the national burden of disease associated 
with typhoons and torrential rains in Korea.
METHODS: During the period of 2002-2012, 11 typhoons and five torrential rains 
were selected. Mortality and morbidities were defined as accentual death, injury 
and injury-related infection, and mental health. Their incidences were estimated 
from National Health Insurance Service. Case-crossover design was used to define 
the disaster-related excess mortality and morbidity. Disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) were directly assessed from excess mortality and morbidity.
RESULTS: The burden of disease from typhoons increased with the intensity, with 
107.7, 30.6, and 36.6 DALYs per 100,000 per event for strong, moderate, and weak 
typhoons, respectively. Burden of disease from torrential rains were 56.9, 52.8, 
and 26.4 DALYs per 100,000 per event for strong, moderate, and weak episodes, 
respectively. Mental disorders contributed more years lived with disability 
(YLDs) than did injuries in most cases, but the injury-induced YLDs associated 
with strong typhoon and torrential rain were higher than those of 
lower-intensity. The elderly was the most vulnerable to most types of disaster 
and storm intensities, and males younger than 65 years were more vulnerable to a 
strong torrential rain event.
CONCLUSION: The intensity of torrential rain or typhoon was the strongest 
determinant of the burden of disease from natural disasters in Korea. Population 
vulnerable may vary depending on the nature and strength of the disasters.

Background: Life expectancy of HIV-infected patients has increased with 
antiretroviral treatment (ART). Chronic diseases associated with aging, 
including metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are becoming more prevalent in 
this population. We aimed to evaluate the association of obesity and aging with 
cardiometabolic comorbidities and metabolic health status among patients with 
HIV infection. Methods: We evaluated 580 HIV-1 infected patients (71.7% male, 
mean age of 47.7 ± 11.5 years). We analyzed the association of age and obesity 
(defined by and by central obesity) with gender, duration of HIV infection, and 
ART, anthropometric parameters, cardiometabolic comorbidities, Framingham risk 
score (FRS), blood pressure, lipid profile, uric acid, liver biochemical tests, 
and glycemic profile. Furthermore, we analyzed the above-mentioned associations 
according to the category and central obesity into the metabolically healthy 
(MH) and unhealthy (MUH) categories. To evaluate the association of 
anthropometric parameters with cardiometabolic comorbidities, we performed 
unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models. Results: The prevalence of 
excessive weight and cardiometabolic comorbidities increased with age. Patients 
with normal weight were younger and there was a higher proportion of female 
patients in the obesity group. The prevalence of hypertension and metabolic 
syndrome were higher among patients who were overweight or with obesity. The FRS 
was higher among patients with obesity. The proportion of MUH patients was 
higher among patients with excessive weight and central obesity. MUH patients 
had more cardiometabolic comorbidities and a higher FRS. In the normal weight 
group, MUH patients were older, and in the obesity group they were more likely 
to be male. The anthropometric parameter most associated with metabolic syndrome 
was waist circumference and that most associated with hypertension was 
waist-to-height ratio. The anthropometric parameter most associated with 
diabetes and FRS was waist-to-hip ratio. Conclusion: Patients with HIV present a 
high prevalence of obesity and related comorbidities. Ageing significantly 
contributes to metabolic dysfunction in this population. The proportion of MUH 
patients is higher among groups with excessive weight and central obesity, with 
those patients presenting a higher cardiovascular risk. Our results highlight 
the importance of evaluating and addressing obesity in patients with HIV, as 
well as metabolic comorbidities and cardiovascular risk.

This research investigated the relationship between alcohol outlet density (AOD) 
and life expectancy, as mediated by community violence and community 
disadvantage. We used linear regression models to assess bivariate and 
multivariate relationships. There was a negative bivariate association between 
liquor store density and average life expectancy (β = -7.3370, p < 0.001). This 
relationship was partially attenuated when controlling for community 
disadvantage and fully attenuated when controlling for community violence. 
Bars/taverns (i.e., on-premise) were not associated with average life expectancy 
(β = -0.589, p = 0.220). Liquor store density is associated with higher levels 
of community disadvantage and higher rates of violence, both of which are 
associated with lower life expectancies. Future research, potential 
intervention, and current related policies are discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of incisional negative pressure 
wound therapy (iNPWT) in preventing surgical site infection in obese women after 
caesarean section.
DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside a clinical trial.
SETTING: Five obstetric departments in Denmark.
POPULATION: Women with a pregestational body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 .
METHOD: We used data from a randomised controlled trial of 876 obese women who 
underwent elective or emergency caesarean section and were subsequently treated 
with iNPWT (n = 432) or a standard dressing (n = 444). Costs were estimated 
using data from four Danish National Databases and analysed from a healthcare 
perspective with a time horizon of 3 months after birth.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness based on incremental cost per surgical 
site infection avoided and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: The total healthcare costs per woman were €5793.60 for iNPWT and 
€5840.89 for standard dressings. Incisional NPWT was the dominant strategy 
because it was both less expensive and more effective; however, no statistically 
significant difference was found for costs or QALYs. At a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €30,000, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective 
was 92.8%. A subgroup analysis stratifying by BMI shows that the cost saving of 
the intervention was mainly driven by the benefit to women with a pre-pregnancy 
BMI ≥35 kg/m2 .
CONCLUSION: Incisional NPWT appears to be cost saving compared with standard 
dressings but this finding is not statistically significant. The cost savings 
were primarily found in women with a pre-pregnancy BMI ≥35 kg/m2 .
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Prophylactic incisional NPWT reduces the risk of SSI after 
caesarean section and is probably dominant compared with standard dressings

62. Management of Physical Health Conditions in Adults with Severe Mental
Disorders.

Geneva: World Health Organization; 2018.
WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee.

People with severe mental disorders (SMD) - i.e. schizophrenia and other 
psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, and moderate‐to‐severe depression - have 
a 2-3 times higher average mortality rate compared to the general population, 
translating to a reduced life expectancy by 10 to 20 years. The majority of 
deaths amongst people with SMD are attributable to physical health conditions 
such as non-communicable diseases as well as infectious diseases. Risk factors 
for non-communicable diseases, such as sedentary behaviour and harmful use of 
alcohol, are also risk factors for SMD and strongly link the two. In clinical 
practice, however, such interactions and comorbidities are routinely overlooked. 
WHO has initiated the process of development of recommendations on the 
management of physical health conditions in people with severe mental disorders. 
To this end, a Guideline Development Group (GDG) reviewed the GRADE evidence 
profiles for each outcome and each key question relevant to these guidelines and 
is formulating recommendations based on the evidence for the management of 
physical health conditions in people with severe mental disorders. These new 
guidelines from WHO on management of physical health conditions in people with 
SMD will provide evidence-based, up-to-date recommendations to practitioners 
regarding how to appropriately clinically manage such co-morbid illness. These 
guidelines will facilitate the implementation of WHO’s Comprehensive Mental 
Health Action Plan(World Health Organization, 2013) and the Mental Health Gap 
Action Programme (mhGAP).

63. Pharmacoeconomic Review Report: Cysteamine delayed-release capsules
(Procysbi):  Horizon Pharma Ireland Ltd: Indication: For the treatment of
nephropathic  cystinosis [Internet].

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2018 Feb.
CADTH Common Drug Reviews.

Cysteamine (Procysbi), a delayed-release formulation containing 25 mg or 75 mg 
of cysteamine bitartrate (referred to as delayed-release cysteamine) was 
approved by Health Canada for the treatment of patients with nephropathic 
cystinosis. Cystinosis is a recessive autosomal genetic ultra-rare disease 
affecting 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 live births in Europe (1 in 62,500 in 
Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean, Quebec), characterized by renal and extrarenal (i.e., 
diabetes, osteopenia, muscular weakness and wasting, growth retardation, etc.) 
complications. Cysteamine acts through preventing or delaying the occurrence of 
renal and extrarenal complications and hence prolonging life expectancy. The 
recommended dose of delayed-release cysteamine is 1.3 g/m2 daily to be given in 
two equal doses per day. At the manufacturer’s submitted price ($11.30 per 25 mg 
capsule, $33.89 per 75 mg capsule), the daily dose cost will vary from $372.90 
in a two-year-old child (based on a body surface area of 0.63 m2) to $881.40 in 
adults (based on a body surface area of 1.50 m2), or $136,000 to $321,000 per 
patient annually.

Objective: The addition of omalizumab to standard therapy has proven to be 
efficacious in children with severe allergic asthma. The goal of this study was 
to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding omalizumab to standard treatment for 
asthma in Chinese pediatric patients.Methods: A Markov model was constructed to 
project the health and economic outcomes in pediatric patients with severe 
allergic asthma. Model inputs were obtained from the literature. Cost and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were measured over a five-year time horizon. 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.Results: For the 
base-case analysis, the addition of omalizumab to standard therapy yielded an 
incremental cost of $49,047 for 0.232 incremental QALY, led to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $211,217/QALY. Sensitivity analyses were robust for 
these results.Conclusions: This study found that the addition of omalizumab is 
not a cost-effective strategy compared with standard therapy for children with 
severe allergic asthma in China due to its high cost.

BACKGROUND: Acute meningitis has a high case-fatality rate and survivors can 
have severe lifelong disability. We aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment 
of the levels and trends of global meningitis burden that could help to guide 
introduction, continuation, and ongoing development of vaccines and treatment 
programmes.
METHODS: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2016 
study estimated meningitis burden due to one of four types of cause: 
pneumococcal, meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and a residual 
category of other causes. Cause-specific mortality estimates were generated via 
cause of death ensemble modelling of vital registration and verbal autopsy data 
that were subject to standardised data processing algorithms. Deaths were 
multiplied by the GBD standard life expectancy at age of death to estimate years 
of life lost, the mortality component of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). 
A systematic analysis of relevant publications and hospital and claims data was 
used to estimate meningitis incidence via a Bayesian meta-regression tool. 
Meningitis deaths and cases were split between causes with meta-regressions of 
aetiological proportions of mortality and incidence, respectively. Probabilities 
of long-term impairment by cause of meningitis were applied to survivors and 
used to estimate years of life lived with disability (YLDs). We assessed the 
relationship between burden metrics and Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a 
composite measure of development based on fertility, income, and education.
FINDINGS: Global meningitis deaths decreased by 21·0% from 1990 to 2016, from 
403 012 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 319 426-458 514) to 318 400 
(265 218-408 705). Incident cases globally increased from 2·50 million (95% UI 
2·19-2·91) in 1990 to 2·82 million (2·46-3·31) in 2016. Meningitis mortality and 
incidence were closely related to SDI. The highest mortality rates and incidence 
rates were found in the peri-Sahelian countries that comprise the African 
meningitis belt, with six of the ten countries with the largest number of cases 
and deaths being located within this region. Haemophilus influenzae type b was 
the most common cause of incident meningitis in 1990, at 780 070 cases (95% UI 
613 585-978 219) globally, but decreased the most (-49·1%) to become the least 
common cause in 2016, with 397 297 cases (291 076-533 662). Meningococcus was 
the leading cause of meningitis mortality in 1990 (192 833 deaths [95% UI 
153 358-221 503] globally), whereas other meningitis was the leading cause for 
both deaths (136 423 [112 682-178 022]) and incident cases (1·25 million 
[1·06-1·49]) in 2016. Pneumococcus caused the largest number of YLDs (634 458 
[444 787-839 749]) in 2016, owing to its more severe long-term effects on 
survivors. Globally in 2016, 1·48 million (1·04-1·96) YLDs were due to 
meningitis compared with 21·87 million (18·20-28·28) DALYs, indicating that the 
contribution of mortality to meningitis burden is far greater than the 
contribution of disabling outcomes.
INTERPRETATION: Meningitis burden remains high and progress lags substantially 
behind that of other vaccine-preventable diseases. Particular attention should 
be given to developing vaccines with broader coverage against the causes of 
meningitis, making these vaccines affordable in the most affected countries, 
improving vaccine uptake, improving access to low-cost diagnostics and 
therapeutics, and improving support for disabled survivors. Substantial 
uncertainty remains around pathogenic causes and risk factors for meningitis. 
Ongoing, active cause-specific surveillance of meningitis is crucial to continue 
and to improve monitoring of meningitis burdens and trends throughout the world.

BACKGROUND: The importance of experienced work stress and individual traits as 
well as their interplay is analyzed with regard to dysfunctional coping behavior 
in case of sickness.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the predictive capability of 
effort-reward imbalance (ERI) including overcommitment, meaning the intrinsic 
propensity in terms of excessive work-related expenditure (OC), in consideration 
of dispositional optimism/pessimism on presenteeism.
METHODS: A total of 353 men and women aged 38 from the 25th panel wave of The 
Saxony Longitudinal Study in 2011 were included in the analysis. Effort-reward 
imbalance (ERI) including overcommitment was assessed with the Effort-Reward 
Imbalance Questionnaire. Dispositional optimism and pessimism were quantified 
using the German version of the Life-Orientation-Test (LOT-R). Presenteeism was 
measured by single item two years later.
RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis showed that the amount of the 
effort-reward imbalance experienced in 2011 had no statistically significant 
predictive potential with regard to presenteeism in 2013. After splitting the 
sample according to a validated effort-reward imbalance threshold, remarkable 
prediction of presenteeism for participants experiencing an ERI was accomplished 
by the moderating effect of dispositional pessimism on overcommitment (ß= 0.32; 
p <  0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although ERI did not have the expected predictive capability 
relating to the entire sample, the detailed analysis of the moderating effect of 
pessimism on overcommitment and the resulting amount of explained variance for 
those participants experiencing an ERI is a noteworthy finding.

OBJECTIVE: To assess trends of mortality attributable to child and maternal 
undernutrition (CMU), overweight/obesity and dietary risks of non-communicable 
diseases (NCD) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) using data from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) Study 2015.
DESIGN: For each risk factor, a systematic review of data was used to compute 
the exposure level and the effect size. A Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression 
analysis was used to estimate the exposure level of the risk factors by age, 
sex, geography and year. The burden of all-cause mortality attributable to CMU, 
fourteen dietary risk factors (eight diets, five nutrients and fibre intake) and 
overweight/obesity was estimated.
SETTING: Sub-Saharan Africa.ParticipantsAll age groups and both sexes.
RESULTS: In 2015, CMU, overweight/obesity and dietary risks of NCD accounted for 
826204 (95 % uncertainty interval (UI) 737346, 923789), 266768 (95 % UI 189051, 
353096) and 558578 (95 % UI 453433, 680197) deaths, respectively, representing 
10·3 % (95 % UI 9·1, 11·6 %), 3·3 % (95 % UI 2·4, 4·4 %) and 7·0 % (95 % UI 5·8, 
8·3 %) of all-cause mortality. While the age-standardized proportion of 
all-cause mortality accounted for by CMU decreased by 55·2 % between 1990 and 
2015 in SSA, it increased by 63·3 and 17·2 % for overweight/obesity and dietary 
risks of NCD, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing burden of diet- and obesity-related diseases and the 
reduction of mortality attributable to CMU indicate that SSA is undergoing a 
rapid nutritional transition. To tackle the impact in SSA, interventions and 
international development agendas should also target dietary risks associated 
with NCD and overweight/obesity.

The emergence of primordial RNA-based life would have required the abiotic 
synthesis of nucleotides, and their participation in nonenzymatic RNA 
replication. Although considerable progress has been made toward potentially 
prebiotic syntheses of the pyrimidine nucleotides (C and U) and their 2-thio 
variants, efficient routes to the canonical purine nucleotides (A and G) remain 
elusive. Reported syntheses are low yielding and generate a large number of 
undesired side products. Recently, a potentially prebiotic pathway to 
8-oxo-adenosine and 8-oxo-inosine has been demonstrated, raising the question of 
the suitability of the 8-oxo-purines as substrates for prebiotic RNA 
replication. Here we show that the 8-oxo-purine nucleotides are poor substrates 
for nonenzymatic RNA primer extension, both as activated monomers and when 
present in the template strand; their presence at the end of a primer also 
strongly reduces the rate and fidelity of primer extension. To provide a proper 
comparison with 8-oxo-inosine, we also examined primer extension reactions with 
inosine, and found that inosine exhibits surprisingly rapid and accurate 
nonenzymatic RNA copying. We propose that inosine, which can be derived from 
adenosine by deamination, could have acted as a surrogate for G in the earliest 
stages of the emergence of life.

BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses of studies comparing transcatheter aortic valve 
implants (TAVIs) and sutureless aortic valve replacement (SU-AVR) show differing 
effectiveness and safety profiles. The approaches also differ in their surgical 
cost (including operating room and device).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the incremental 
cost-utility of SU-AVR vs TAVIs for the treatment of intermediate- to high-risk 
patients in the US, Germany, France, Italy, UK, and Australia.
METHODS: A patient-level simulation compares in-hospital pathways of patients 
undergoing SU-AVR or TAVIs; later, patient history is modeled at the cohort 
level. Hospital outcomes for TAVIs reproduce data from recent series; in SU-AVR 
patients, outcomes are obtained by applying relative efficacy estimates in a 
recent meta-analysis on 1,462 patients. After discharge, survival depends on the 
development of paravalvular leak and the need for dialysis. A comprehensive 
third-party payer perspective encompassing both in-hospital and long-term costs 
was adopted.
RESULTS: Due to lower in-hospital (4.1% vs 7.0%) and overall mortality, patients 
treated with SU-AVR are expected to live an average of 1.25 years more compared 
with those undergoing TAVIs, with a mean gain of 1.14 quality-adjusted 
life-years. Both in-hospital and long-term costs were lower for SU-AVR than for 
TAVIs with total savings ranging from $4,158 (France) to $20,930 (US).
CONCLUSION: SU-AVR results dominant when compared to TAVIs in intermediate- to 
high-risk patients. Both in-hospital and long-term costs are lower for SU-AVR 
than for TAVI patients, with concomitant significant gains in life expectancy, 
both raw and adjusted for the quality of life.
