generalized anxiety disorder to better understand the impact of their condition 
on their daily lives and their experience with different treatment options, 
including psychotherapy.
RESULTS: Interpersonal therapy compared with usual care reduced posttreatment 
major depressive disorder scores (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.24, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: -0.47 to -0.02) and reduced relapse/recurrence in 
patients with major depressive disorder (relative risk [RR]: 0.41, 95% CI: 
0.27-0.63). Supportive therapy compared with usual care improved major 
depressive disorder scores (SMD: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.45-0.72) and increased 
posttreatment recovery (odds ratio [OR]: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.19-6.16) in patients 
with major depressive disorder. CBT compared with usual care increased response 
(OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.11-2.26) and recovery (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 1.98-5.93) in 
patients with major depressive disorder and decreased relapse/recurrence (RR: 
0.68, 95% CI: 0.65-0.87]). For patients with generalized anxiety disorder, CBT 
improved symptoms posttreatment (SMD: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.93), improved 
clinical response posttreatment (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.55-0.74), and improved 
quality-of-life scores (SMD: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.06-0.82). There was a significant 
difference in posttreatment recovery (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.11-3.54) and mean 
major depressive disorder symptom scores (weighted mean difference: -3.07, 95% 
CI: -4.69 to -1.45) for patients who received individual versus group CBT. 
Details about the providers of psychotherapy were rarely reported in the 
systematic reviews we examined.In the base case probabilistic cost-utility 
analysis, compared with usual care, both group and individual CBT were 
associated with increased survival: 0.11 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
(95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.03-0.22) and 0.12 QALYs (95% CrI: 0.03-0.25), 
respectively.Group CBT provided by nonphysicians was associated with the 
smallest increase in discounted costs: $401 (95% CrI: $1,177 to 1,665). Group 
CBT provided by physicians, individual CBT provided by nonphysicians, and 
individual CBT provided by physicians were associated with the incremental costs 
of $1,805 (95% CrI: 65-3,516), $3,168 (95% CrI: 889-5,624), and $5,311 (95% CrI: 
2,539-8,938), respectively. The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was lowest for group CBT provided by nonphysicians ($3,715/QALY 
gained) and highest for individual CBT provided by physicians ($43,443/QALY 
gained). In the analysis that ranked best strategies, individual CBT versus 
group CBT provided by nonphysicians yielded an ICER of $192,618 per QALY. The 
probability of group CBT provided by nonphysicians being cost-effective versus 
usual care was greater than 95% for all willingness-to-pay thresholds over 
$20,000 per QALY and was around 88% for individual CBT provided by physicians at 
a threshold of $100,000 per QALY.We estimated that adding structured 
psychotherapy to usual care over the next 5 years would result in a net budget 
impact of $68 million to $529 million, depending on a range of factors. We also 
estimated that to provide structured psychotherapy to all adults with major 
depressive disorder (alone or combined with generalized anxiety disorder) in 
Ontario by 2021, an estimated 500 therapists would be needed to provide group 
therapy, and 2,934 therapists would be needed to provide individual 
therapy.People with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety 
disorder with whom we spoke reported finding psychotherapy effective, but they 
also reported experiencing a large number of barriers that prevented them from 
finding effective psychotherapy in a timely manner. Participants reported 
wanting more freedom to choose the type of psychotherapy they received.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with usual care, treatment with CBT, interpersonal 
therapy, or supportive therapy significantly reduces depression symptoms 
posttreatment. CBT significantly reduces anxiety symptoms posttreatment in 
patients with generalized anxiety disorder.Compared with usual care, treatment 
with structured psychotherapy (CBT or interpersonal therapy) represents good 
value for money for adults with major depressive disorder and/or generalized 
anxiety disorder. The most affordable option is group structured psychotherapy 
provided by nonphysicians, with the selective use of individual structured 
psychotherapy provided by nonphysicians or physicians for those who would 
benefit most from it (i.e., patients who are not engaging well with or adhering 
to group therapy).

The increase in life expectancy can influence the prevalence of dementias in the 
population. Instruments that evaluate cognitive functions such as the Mini 
Mental State Examination (MMSE) are necessary for the investigation of dementia. 
The supposition that patient score on the MMSE can be influenced by academic 
level points to the need for establishing cut-off values that take into account 
educational level. The aim of this study was to review MMSE cut-off values 
adjusted for schooling in a large southern Brazilian sample.
METHOD: Demographic data and MMSE scores of 968 subjects, of which 162 were 
dementia patients and 806 healthy participants, were analyzed. The sample was 
grouped according to education. The cut-off values were established by ROC Curve 
analysis.
RESULTS: The total sample mean age was 70.6±7.3 years, and the mean years of 
education was 7.2±5.3. The cut-off score of 23 points (sensitivity=86%, 
specificity=83%) was observed as the optimal level to detect dementia on the 
MMSE instrument for the overall sample. Regarding level of schooling, the 
cut-off values were: 21 for the illiterate group (sensitivity=93%, 
specificity=82%), 22 for the low education group (sensitivity=87%, 
specificity=82%), 23 for the middle education group (sensitivity=86%, 
specificity=87%) and 24 for the high education group (sensitivity=81%, 
specificity=87%).
CONCLUSIONS: The cut-off values revealed by this analysis, and adjusted for 
level of schooling, can improve the clinical evaluation of cognitive deficits.

Publisher: A elevação da expectativa de vida pode influenciar na prevalência das 
demências na população. Instrumentos que avaliem as funções cognitivas, como o 
Mini Exame do Estado Mental (MEEM), são necessários para a investigação de 
demência. A suposição de que o resultado do MEEM de um paciente pode ser 
influenciado pelo nível de escolaridade demonstra a necessidade do 
estabelecimento de pontos de corte que levem em consideração a escolaridade. O 
objetivo deste estudo foi revisar os pontos de corte do MEEM ajustados para a 
escolaridade em uma grande amostra do sul do Brasil.
MÉTODO: Dados demográficos e escores do MEEM de 968 indivíduos, 162 pacientes 
com demência e 806 participantes saudáveis foram analisados. A amostra foi 
agrupada de acordo com a educação. Para estabelecer os pontos de corte foi 
utilizada a Curva ROC.
RESULTADOS: A média de idade da amostra total foi 70,6±7,3 e a média de anos de 
estudo foi 7,2±5,3. O ponto de corte 23 (sensibilidade=86%), 
(especificidade=83%) foi o ponto que melhor detectou demência na amostra total. 
Considerando o nível de escolaridade, os pontos de corte foram: 21 no grupo de 
analfabetos (sensibilidade=93%, especificidade=82%), 22 no grupo de baixa 
escolaridade (sensibilidade=87%, especificidade=82%), 23 no grupo de média 
escolaridade (sensibilidade=86%, especificidade=87%) e 24 no grupo de alta 
escolaridade (sensibilidade=81%, especificidade=87%).
CONCLUSÕES: Os pontos de corte, quando se considera a escolaridade, podem 
aperfeiçoar a avaliação clínica dos déficits cognitivos.

North American data show that in the year 2000 around 4.5 million people had a 
diagnosis of dementia and more than a half were at moderate or severe stages of 
the disease. There is inevitable cognitive and functional decline caused by all 
etiologies of irreversible dementia as well as many behavioral symptoms that 
compromise the quality of life of both patients and caregivers. Few published 
studies have investigated issues concerning severe dementia such as predictors 
of mortality and life expectancy, nutrition, end of life issues and palliative 
care in terminal dementia, as well as best pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological treatments. Due to the complexity that characterizes 
advanced dementia, it is important that this discussion starts as early as 
possible allowing some decisions to be taken, preferably when the patients can 
still express their opinion.

Publisher: Dados Norte-Americanos apontam que o contingente de portadores de DA 
no ano 2000 era de cerca de 4,5 milhões de pessoas e são esperados em torno de 
13 milhões para o ano 2050 sendo mais da metade em fase moderada e grave da 
doença. Além do declínio cognitivo e funcional, são muito comuns diferentes 
sintomas comportamentais, que muito diminuem a qualidade de vida de pacientes e 
cuidadores. São escassos os estudos para o desenvolvimento de fármacos, 
conhecimento de medidas não-farmacológicas, estudos epidemiológicos que 
averiguam fatores que interferem na história natural da doença, formas de 
abordar o fim de vida, além de questões como nutrição e linguagem. O longo curso 
desta doença de prognóstico temporal incerto traz consideráveis dúvidas quanto 
às decisões a serem tomadas. A visão do conforto e proporcionalidade das ações e 
do princípio do não-malefício podem servir de guia para a tomada de decisão.

OBJECTIVES: The present study sought to characterize the degree of general 
satisfaction with life and degree of satisfaction on four domains: health, 
physical capacity, mental capacity and social involvement, and to determine the 
characteristics of self-reports of individuals enrolled on the program in 
relation to their psychological well-being focusing on the dimensions: autonomy, 
personal growth, control, positive relationships with others, purpose, personal 
acceptance and generativity, and to analyse the effect of time studying on level 
of well-being.
METHOD: A total of 140 elderly students of a University for the Third Age took 
part in the study. The Global Satisfaction With Life Scale and the Self 
Development Scale (with six psychological well-being subscales) were applied. 
Continuous variables for the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney 
test. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship 
among numeric variables. Internal consistency of the instrument scales was 
analysed by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient.
RESULTS: Results showed that students who had attended the University of the 
Third Age for six months or longer had a higher level of satisfaction with life 
and greater psychological adjustment compared with new entrants to the same 
institution.
CONCLUSION: The study results confirmed the positive effects of continuing 
education on the well-being of elderly and its contribution to successful aging.

Publisher: OBJETIVOS: O presente estudo visou caracterizar o grau de satisfação 
geral com a vida e o grau de satisfação referenciada a quatro domínios: saúde, 
capacidade física, capacidade mental e envolvimento social; conhecer as 
características dos autorrelatos dos inscritos no programa em relação ao próprio 
bem-estar psicológico, focando as dimensões: autonomia, crescimento pessoal, 
domínio, relações positivas com os outros, propósito, autoaceitação e 
geratividade; analisar a influência do tempo no nível de bem-estar.
MÉTODO: Participaram do estudo 140 idosos frequentadores de uma Universidade 
Aberta à Terceira Idade. Utilizou-se uma Escala de Satisf ação Geral Com a Vida 
e outra de Desenvolvimento Pessoal (com seis subescalas de bem-estar 
psicológico). Para comparação das variáveis contínuas entre os dois grupos foi 
utilizado o teste de Mann-Whitney. Para analisar a relação entre as variáveis 
numéricas foi utilizado o coeficiente de correlação de Spearman. Para avaliar a 
consistência interna dos instrumentos escalares foi calculado o coeficiente 
alpha de Cronbach.
RESULTADOS: Os dados revelaram que os participantes que frequentavam a 
Universidade Aberta à Terceira Idade há seis meses ou mais estavam altamente 
satisfeitos com a vida e com índices de ajustamento psicológicos superiores com 
relação aos que ingressaram atualmente na instituição estudada.
CONCLUSÃO: Os resultados confirmaram os efeitos positivos da educação permanente 
para o bem-estar dos idosos e para um envelhecimento bem-sucedido.

Life expectancy in Brazil has increased markedly over the last 30 years. Hence, 
age-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), warrant special 
attention due to their high prevalence in the elderly. Pharmacologic treatment 
of AD is based on cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) and memantine, leading to 
modest clinical benefits both in the short and long-term. However, clinical 
response is heterogeneous and needs further investigation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the rate of response to ChEI in AD after three months 
of treatment.
METHODS: Patients with mild or moderate dementia due to probable AD or to AD 
associated with cerebrovascular disease were included in the study. The subjects 
were assessed at baseline and again after three months of ChEI treatment. 
Subjects were submitted to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis 
Dementia Rating Scale, Katz Basic Activities of Daily Living, Pfeffer Functional 
Activities Questionnaire, Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Cornell Scale for 
Depression in Dementia. Good response was defined by a gain of ≥2 points on the 
MMSE after three months of treatment in relation to baseline.
RESULTS: Seventy-one patients, 66 (93%) with probable AD and five (7%) with AD 
associated with cerebrovascular disease, were evaluated. The good response rate 
at three months was 31.0%, being 37.2% and 21.4% in mild and moderate dementia, 
respectively. There were no significant differences on most tests, except for 
improvement in hallucinations, agitation and dysphoria in moderate dementia 
patients.
CONCLUSION: The rate of good clinical response to ChEI was higher than usually 
reported. Specific behavioral features significantly improved in the subgroup of 
moderate dementia.

Publisher: A expectativa de vida no Brasil aumentou significativamente nos 
últimos 30 anos. Desse modo, transtornos relacionados à idade, como a doença de 
Alzheimer (DA), merecem especial atenção, devido à elevada prevalência. O 
tratamento farmacológico da DA se baseia nos inibidores da colinesterase (IChE) 
e na memantina, com melhora modesta em curto e longo prazo. Entretanto, a 
resposta clínica é heterogênea e necessita maior investigação.
OBJETIVO: Investigar a taxa de resposta aos IChE em pacientes com DA após três 
meses de tratamento.
MÉTODOS: Pacientes com demência leve ou moderada devida à DA ou DA com doença 
cerebrovascular foram avaliados antes e após três meses de uso de IChE. Todos 
foram submetidos ao Mini-Exame do Estado Mental (MEEM), Escala de Demência 
Mattis, avaliação das atividades básicas de vida diária de Katz, Questionário de 
Pfeffer, Inventário Neuropsiquiátrico e Escala de Depressão de Cornell. Boa 
resposta foi definida pelo ganho de ≥2 pontos no MEEM em relação à primeira 
consulta, após três meses.
RESULTADOS: Setenta e um pacientes, 66 (93%) com DA provável e cinco (7%) com DA 
associada à doença cerebrovascular, foram avaliados. A taxa de boa resposta 
clínica em três meses foi de 31.0%, sendo 37,2% e 21,4% na demência leve e 
moderada, respectivamente. Não houve diferença significativa na maioria dos 
testes, exceto para melhora de alucinação, agitação e depressão em pacientes com 
demência moderada.
CONCLUSÃO: A taxa de boa resposta clínica aos IChE foi superior à encontrada na 
literatura. Observou-se melhora de alguns sintomas comportamentais em pacientes 
com DA moderada.

Increased life expectancy has led to a significant number of elderly enrolling 
on Youth and Adult Education programs (YAE). These individuals leave inactivity 
and negative aspects of aging in search of opportunities for social inclusion.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of sociodemographic factors and depressive 
and cognitive symptoms on quality of life (QL) of elderly attending the YAE of 
São Carlos city in São Paulo state.
METHODS: A descriptive and quantitative study approved by the Research Ethics 
Committee of São Carlos Federal University was conducted. The sample comprised 
all elderly undertaking the YAE literacy program in 2012. The instruments used 
were the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), 
WHOQOL-bref and WHOQOL-old, and a sociodemographic instrument.
RESULTS: We interviewed 23 elderly, predominantly females (91.3%) in the early 
stages of old age (69.6%). The number of years of YAE study showed no 
correlation with cognition scores obtained on the MMSE or with QL domains. 
However, scores on the GDS had a moderate inverse relationship with total scores 
for the Physical (p<0.01), Sensory Functioning (p<0.05), Independence (p<0.01), 
Past, Present and Future Activities (p<0.05), Social Participation (p<0.01), and 
Intimacy (p<0.05) QV domains, and a strong inversely proportional relationship 
with the Social Relationships QV domain (p<0.01). Scores attained on the MMSE 
showed a moderate and direct relationship with total scores on the Independence 
QL domain (p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elderly on literacy programs have average quality of life scores. 
Several QL domains are influenced by depression and cognitive symptoms.

Publisher: O aumento da expectativa de vida trouxe um significativo contingente 
de idosos aos programas de Educação de Jovens e Adultos (EJA). Essas pessoas 
deixam a inatividade e os aspectos negativos do envelhecimento e buscam novas 
oportunidades de inclusão social.
OBJETIVO: Avaliar a relação de fatores sociodemográficos e sintomas depressivos 
e cognitivos na qualidade de vida (QV) de idosos que frequentam a EJA do 
município de São Carlos-SP.
MÉTODOS: Pesquisa descritiva e quantitativa aprovada pelo Comitê de Ética em 
Pesquisa da Universidade Federal de São Carlos. A amostra foi composta por todos 
os idosos que estavam no processo de alfabetização na EJA, em 2012. Os 
instrumentos utilizados foram o Mini-exame do Estado Mental (MEEM), a Escala de 
Depressão Geriátrica (GDS), o WHOQOL-bref e WHOQOL-old, e um instrumento 
sociodemográfico.
RESULTADOS: Foram entrevistados 23 idosos, em sua maioria do sexo feminino 
(91,3%), nos anos iniciais da velhice (69,6%). O número de anos de estudo EJA 
não apresentou correlação com os escores de cognição obtidos por meio do MEEM e 
com os domínios de QV. No entanto, a pontuação na GDS teve relação inversa e 
moderada com os escores totais dos domínios de QV Físico (p<0,01), Funcionamento 
do Sensório (p<0,05), Autonomia (p<0,01), Atividades Passadas, Presentes e 
Futuras (p<0,05), Participação social (p<0,01) e Intimidade (p<0,05) e relação 
forte e inversamente proporcional com o domínio Relações Sociais (p<0,01). E as 
pontuações obtidas a partir do MEEM mostrou relação moderada e direta com os 
escores totais do domínio QV Autonomia (p=0,001).
CONCLUSÃO: Idosos em programas de alfabetização têm uma pontuação média de 
qualidade de vida e alguns domínios da QV são influenciados por sintomas 
depressivos e cognitivos.

With the gradual increase in the life expectancy of the population due to 
scientific progress and public health at the service of society, the prevalence 
of dementia has been increasing at different rates worldwide. Currently, the 
prevalence rates range between 5% and 7% (6.4% in the U.S. and up to 8.5 % in 
Latin America) in subjects older than 60 years. The lowest prevalence rate 
(2.1%) has been reported from sub-Saharan Africa, probably due to selective 
mortality under 60 years of age. By contrast, a very high prevalence of dementia 
(23.6% dementia in individuals >60 years) was observed in the city of Neiva, 
Southern Colombia. We believe that this high rate could be explained by the 
presence of several risk factors such as very low schooling, low socio-economic 
strata, chronic diseases, the inclusion of geriatric homes among others, and 
additional unknown factors.

Publisher: Com o aumento gradual da expectativa de vida das pessoas, devido aos 
progressos científico e de saúde pública a serviço da sociedade, a prevalência 
de demência tem aumentado a taxas bastante divergentes em todo o mundo. 
Atualmente, as taxas de prevalência variam entre 5% e 7% (6,4% em os EUA até 
8,5% na América Latina) em indivíduos com idade superior a 60 anos. Prevalência 
mais baixa (2,1%) foi relatada na África sub-saariana, provavelmente devido a 
mortalidade seletiva abaixo dos 60 anos de idade. Ao contrário, uma alta 
prevalência de demência (23,6% de demência em pessoas >60 anos) foi observada na 
cidade de Neiva, no sul da Colômbia. Acreditamos que essa taxa alta pode ser 
explicada pela presença de vários fatores de risco, como: baixa escolaridade, 
níveis socio-económicos mais baixos, doenças crônicas, inclusão de instituições 
geriátricas, entre outros, e outros possíveis fatores desconhecidos.

BACKGROUND: Many low-income and crises-affected countries like Sierra Leone 
struggle with the recruitment and retention of their health professionals, 
particularly nurses and doctors. There are multiple factors that influence the 
'recruitment to retention' pipeline. The first stage of an exploration into the 
issues influencing the availability of qualified health care workers may focus 
on the aspects which influence their entry into relevant educational programmes. 
This paper explores the reasons given by junior doctors in Sierra Leone for 
wanting to become a doctor. It also describes entry procedures into 
undergraduate medical education.
METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with purposively sampled junior 
doctors (n = 15) from the only medical school in Sierra Leone in October 2013. 
Digital diaries and two follow-up interviews were used to explore their evolving 
career experiences and aspirations until November 2016. In addition, 
semi-structured interviews with key informants (n = 20), including senior 
teaching staff at the medical school (n = 7), were conducted. Thematic analysis 
was used to explore linkages and themes across cases.
RESULTS: Six themes were identified. The most commonly mentioned reasons for 
wanting to become a doctor were a desire to help (theme 4) and the influence of 
family and friends, via role modelling (theme 2) and verbal encouragement (theme 
3). Other motives were an interest from a young age (theme 1), being attracted 
by the job prospects (theme 5), and having an intellectual and science capacity 
(theme 6). Junior doctors gave at least two and up to six reasons for applying 
to enter the medical profession. Doctors were allowed entry to the medical 
school largely based on their previous academic performance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that multiple reasons underlie the decision to 
apply for entrance to medical school and the decision to enter medicine is 
complex. These findings may inform the review of future admission procedures by 
the medical school in Sierra Leone and similar settings, which is a crucial step 
in addressing the human resource needs for healthcare that currently exist.

INTRODUCTION: Previous trials have demonstrated reductions in atopic dermatitis 
(AD) incidence when healthy, high-risk, non-exclusively breastfed infants were 
fed until four months of age with 100% whey-based partially hydrolysed formula 
(PHF-W) versus standard cow's milk formula (CMF). We assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of this intervention in Singapore.
METHODS: Modelling techniques were used to simulate, from birth to Month 30, the 
incidence and clinical/economic burden of AD in high-risk, non-exclusively 
breastfed infants fed with PHF-W or CMF for up to four months. Epidemiologic and 
clinical data were from a local comparative trial. Expert opinion informed AD 
treatment patterns and outcomes. Outcomes included reduction in AD risk, time 
spent with AD, days without AD flare, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
direct/indirect costs. Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used 
to assess model parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: Over 30 months, with the use of PHF-W instead of CMF, the proportion of 
children who developed AD and the time spent with AD decreased by 16.0% (28.3% 
vs. 44.3%) and 6.4 months, respectively, while time without AD flare and QALYs 
increased by 14.9 days and 0.021 QALYs per patient, respectively. Estimated 
AD-related discounted costs per child for PHF-W and CMF were SGD 771 and SGD 
1,309, respectively (net savings: SGD 538). PHF-W was less expensive and more 
effective than CMF for 73%, and cost less than SGD 50,000 per QALY for 87% of 
all multivariate simulations.
CONCLUSION: Early short-term nutritional intervention with PHF-W instead of CMF 
may reduce AD incidence and costs for healthy, high-risk, non-exclusively 
breastfed infants in Singapore.

Jasmine virus H (JaVH) is a novel virus associated with symptoms of yellow 
mosaic on jasmine. The JaVH genome is 3,867 nt in length with five open reading 
frames (ORFs) encoding a 27-kDa protein (ORF 1), an 87-kDa replicase protein 
(ORF 2), two centrally located movement proteins (ORF 3 and 4), and a 37-kDa 
capsid protein (ORF 5). Based on genomic and phylogenetic analysis, JaVH is 
predicted to be a member of the genus Pelarspovirus in the family Tombusviridae.

In Kawasaki disease (KD), giant coronary aneurysms in the proximal segments of 
the coronary arteries have long been among the serious complications associated 
with acute myocardial infarction. To treat myocardial ischemia in children, 
Kitamura et al. first performed coronary artery bypass grafting in a pediatric 
patient using an autologous saphenous vein. In the early 1980s, they began to 
use the internal thoracic artery (ITA) as a bypass graft to the left anterior 
descending artery, which later was proven to improve long-term life expectancy 
with its favorable long-term patency, as well as growth potential. Thus, the 
excellent characteristics of the ITA have come to be widely known among 
pediatric cardiac surgeons, and a growing number of coronary bypass surgery 
procedures using the ITA are now being performed worldwide. Although a longer 
follow-up with more patients is necessary, downsizing reconstructive procedure 
may be a treatment of choice for giant aneurysms of non-LAD territories to 
improve coronary circulation. The efficacy of surgical treatment for giant 
coronary aneurysms in pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease is now well 
established. Pediatric coronary artery bypass grafting using the ITA, either 
single or bilateral, can be safe not only for patients with Kawasaki coronary 
disease but also for infants with congenital coronary lesions.

Innovative rare disease therapies and health technology assessment (HTA) share a 
lot of similarities. Both represent cases of interaction of epidemiology and 
health economics. Both are relatively new topics in public health practice. And 
both pose a lot of challenges to rare disease stakeholders who are currently 
looking for tools to support the timely access to innovative treatments while 
putting budget spending in order. This is why optimisation of assessment and 
appraisal of new rare disease therapies is a fundamental issue in rare disease 
health policy. Rare disease patients and caregivers expect prolonged life 
expectancy and improved quality of life and they perceive innovative health 
technologies as a rightful way to achieve these objectives.Multi-criteria 
decision analysis (MCDA) provides a structured, transparent approach to identify 
preferred alternatives by means of combined calculation of relative importance 
of different criteria and performance of the alternatives on these criteria. The 
labyrinth of competing interests and numerous stakeholders involved is why 
innovative rare disease health technologies make an excellent case study of the 
integration between HTA and MCDA. This kind of formalisation of decision-making 
is perceived as fair and legitimate, leading to a balance and agreement. MCDA 
provides a stage for a debate of policy priorities, health system specifics and 
societal attitudes, while also addressing the impact of rarity on all criteria 
and considerations.

Nowadays, health funding decisions must be supported by sound arguments in terms 
of both effectiveness and economic criteria. After more than half a century of 
newborn screening for rare diseases, the appropriate economic evaluation 
framework for these interventions is still challenging. The validity of standard 
methods for economic evaluation heavily relies on the availability of robust 
evidence, but collection of such evidence is precluded by the rareness of the 
conditions that may benefit from screening. Furthermore, there are a series of 
conceptual and methodological limitations that warrant further careful 
consideration when assessing the cost-effectiveness of newborn screening 
programs. In this chapter we provide a general overview of current economic 
evaluation methods and the challenges for their application to newborn screening 
programs.

Cost-of-illness (COI) studies quantify the economic burden of a disease, 
including direct healthcare and non-healthcare costs and productivity losses. 
Different approaches can be adopted to evaluate the resources associated to a 
disease and to calculate the total costs. Prevalence-based studies estimate the 
total costs of a disease during a given period, while incidence-based studies 
measure lifetime costs from onset until death. Data can be collected from 
individuals, using a bottom-up approach, or from population statistics, using a 
top-down approach. Different perspectives are possible, but the broadest and 
also mostly used is the societal one. Appropriate discounting should be applied 
for future costs and a sensitivity analyses of main parameters should be 
performed. The main limitation of COI studies is that they don't account the 
outcomes or benefits of possible treatments.There is a lack of COI studies in 
the field of rare diseases. A multinational COI study (BURQOL-RD) evaluated 
recently the burden of 10 rare diseases in Europe, using a prevalence-based 
method with a bottom-up approach to quantify resources from a societal 
perspective, which is the mostly used methodology for COI studies in rare 
diseases; however, several other studies illustrate different approaches to 
conduct COI analysis in this field, such as incidence-based methods or narrower 
perspectives.COI studies are useful to inform policy-makers about the magnitude 
of a disease. To support correctly the decision-making process, it is necessary 
to identify the cost-drivers through COI studies with robust design and 
standardized methodology.

Bridging the gaps between health and social care for rare diseases is not only 
necessary but crucial to increase the life expectancy, quality of life and 
autonomy of people living with a rare disease, supporting them in the full 
realisation of their fundamental human rights.The complexity of rare diseases, 
their strong relation to disability and the current unmet social and daily life 
needs of people living with a rare disease must not be underestimated and 
require urgent attention from all stakeholders involved in care provision, from 
healthcare to social and community services.The Commission Expert Group 
Recommendations to Support the Incorporation of Rare Diseases into Social 
Services and Policies, adopted unanimously in April 2016, by the representatives 
of European Member States and the other rare disease stakeholders, clearly set 
the tone for the need to promote measures that facilitate multidisciplinary, 
holistic, continuous, person-centred and participative care provision to people 
living with rare diseases.These recommendations, sided by other recent policy 
developments at European and national levels, represent an important policy step 
into approaching rare diseases' complex challenges in regards to holistic care 
provision.Innovative approaches aiming at bridging the gap between health, 
social and community service and support providers are currently being developed 
and tested in different European countries: standards of care, networks of 
expertise, case management services, one-stop-shop services, amongst 
others.These ongoing pilot approaches, presented in this chapter, have the power 
to inspire future policies and the effective and efficient implementation of 
holistic care pathways for people living with a rare disease, bringing about 
significant changes for patients, carers, care providers, competent authorities 
and the society at large.Nonetheless, the challenges to fully address this issue 
remain numerous and other key issues will also need to be taken into account 
when moving forward with the implementation of measures that aim at bridging the 
gaps between care providers and providing holistic care to people living with a 
rare disease.

Research in aging biology has identified several pathways that are molecularly 
conserved across species that extend lifespan when mutated. The 
insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathway is one of the most widely studied 
of these. It has been assumed that extending lifespan also extends healthspan 
(the period of life with minimal functional loss). However, data supporting this 
assumption conflict and recent evidence suggest that life extension may, in and 
of itself, extend the frail period. In this study, we use Caenorhabditis elegans 
to further probe the link between lifespan and healthspan. Using movement 
decline as a measure of health, we assessed healthspan across the entire 
lifespan in nine IIS pathway mutants. In one series of experiments, we studied 
healthspan in mass cultures, and in another series, we studied individuals 
longitudinally. We found that long-lived mutants display prolonged mid-life 
movement and do not prolong the frailty period. Lastly, we observed that 
early-adulthood movement was not predictive of late-life movement or survival, 
within identical phenotypes. Overall, these observations show that extending 
lifespan does not prolong the period of frailty. Both genotype and a stochastic 
component modulate aging, and movement late in life is more variable than 
early-life movement.

AIM: Body mass index (BMI) is regarded as a predictor of life expectancy and a 
determinant of mortality. However, the effect of age on BMI-related mortality 
remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the prognostic 
effect of BMI to mortality risk among Korean older persons.
METHODS: Data were collected from the Korean National Health Insurance Services' 
Senior Cohort database. This study analyzed the data of 79 341 men and 91 298 
women aged ≥65 years who underwent health examinations in the 2007 fiscal year. 
Individual mortality was identified 5 years after 2008. The participants were 
stratified into seven groups according to basal BMI. Hazard ratios of death were 
calculated through Cox proportional hazards model after adjusting for age, sex, 
smoking status, exercise, alcohol intake and income.
RESULTS: During the 5-year follow up, 11 651 men and 7 235 women died. In both 
sexes, a lower BMI had a higher hazard ratio (HR), but the trend of increasing 
HR at high BMI was not clear. For men, the lowest HR was 0.79 (95% CI 0.71-0.87) 
at a BMI of 27.5-30.0 kg/m2 . For women, the lowest HR was 0.84 (95% CI 
0.78-0.91) at a BMI of 25.0-27.5 kg/m2 . For both sexes, the relative mortality 
risk was associated with a lower BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: A high BMI is not associated with increased mortality in older 
adults aged ≥65 years, whereas a lower BMI is associated with an increased 
mortality risk in later life in this population. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 
538-546.

Shelterin, the telomeric protein complex, plays a crucial role in telomere 
homeostasis. In fission yeast, telomerase is recruited to chromosome ends by the 
shelterin component Tpz1 and its binding partner Ccq1, where telomerase binds to 
the 3' overhang to add telomeric repeats. Recruitment is initiated by the 
interaction of Ccq1 with the telomerase subunit Est1. However, how telomerase is 
released following elongation remains to be established. Here, we show that Ccq1 
also has a role in the suppression of telomere elongation, when coupled with the 
Clr4 histone H3 methyl-transferase complex and the Clr3 histone deacetylase and 
nucleosome remodelling complex, SHREC. We have dissected the functions of Ccq1 
by establishing a Ccq1-Est1 fusion system, which bypasses the telomerase 
recruitment step. We demonstrate that Ccq1 forms two distinct complexes for 
positive and negative telomerase regulation, with Est1 and Clr3 respectively. 
The negative form of Ccq1 promotes dissociation of Ccq1-telomerase from Tpz1, 
thereby restricting local telomerase activity. The Clr4 complex also has a 
negative regulation activity with Ccq1, independently of SHREC. Thus, we propose 
a model in which Ccq1-Est1 recruits telomerase to mediate telomere extension, 
whilst elongated telomeric DNA recruits Ccq1 with the chromatin-remodelling 
complexes, which in turn releases telomerase from the telomere.
