Metastatic pancreatic cancer is characterised by poor prognosis. High toxicity 
of chemotherapy limits its use in elderly patients with severe comorbidities. 
Meanwhile, in metastatic disease, local treatment did not show the positive 
effect on life expectancy. We present a clinical case of a 72-year-old woman 
with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumour, node, metastases (T3N0M1) 
(according to the seventh TNM classification of the International Union Against 
Cancer). Chemotherapy led to partial response, but later was stopped due to 
severe toxicity. Thereafter, consolidating radiosurgical treatment was 
performed. Dose to pancreatic and liver lesions was 35 Gy in five fractions. 
After 9 months, only one liver lesion and primary pancreatic tumour, stable in 
size were determined by MRI. At present time, the patient is alive and in good 
condition, the disease is stable 50 months after stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT). SBRT provides a high level of local control and in combination 
with systemic treatment can potentially increase survival.

PURPOSE: Morphometric analyses have shown that trunk muscle mass and density are 
associated with mortality in cancer patients. Because of the low incidence of 
spinal metastasis from gastrointestinal cancer and the limited life expectancy 
of these patients, few studies have been reported in this population. We 
evaluated the prognostic value of trunk muscle area and density in predicting 
overall survival.
METHODS: The data from 78 patients with spinal metastases from gastrointestinal 
cancer, collected from February 2009 to July 2016, were evaluated. Psoas muscle 
and paravertebral muscle area and density were measured at the L3 level on CT 
scans taken at the time nearest to the diagnosis of spinal metastasis. Cox 
proportional hazards analysis was performed to evaluate the factors 
independently associated with overall survival.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 68.3 years (range, 42-88 years). The overall 
median survival time was 4.8 months: 2.2 months in the extremely rapid growth 
group (stomach, biliary tract, and pancreas) and 7.6 months in the rapid growth 
group (esophagus, liver, and colorectum). Multivariate analyses showed that 
lower paravertebral muscle density (HR 2.23 [95% CI 1.24-3.99], p = 0.007), 
extremely rapid growth group, presence of abnormal laboratory data, poor 
performance status, and chemotherapy after spinal metastasis were independent 
prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Median overall survival was poor among patients with spinal 
metastases from gastrointestinal carcinoma, especially among those with gastric, 
biliary tract, or pancreatic cancer. Lower paravertebral muscle density was an 
independent poor prognostic factor in patients with spinal metastases from 
gastrointestinal cancer.

Fungal spoilage of bread remains an unsolved issue in bread making. This work 
aims to identify alternative strategies to conventional preservatives in order 
to prevent or delay fungal spoilage of bread. The minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) of bacterial metabolites and chemical preservatives was 
evaluated in vitro, and compared to their in situ activity in baking trials. 
Calcium propionate, sorbic acid, 3-phenyllactic acid, ricinoleic acid, and 
acetic acid were tested both individually and in combination at their MIC values 
against Aspergillus niger and Penicillium roqueforti. The combination of acetic 
acid with propionate and sorbate displayed additive effects against the two 
fungi. For these reasons, we introduced sourdough fermentation with specific 
strains of lactobacilli, using wheat or flaxseed, in order to generate acetate 
in bread. A combination of Lactobacillus hammesii and propionate reduced 
propionate concentration required for shelf life extension of wheat bread 
7-fold. Flaxseed sourdough bread fermented with L. hammesii, excluding any 
preservative, showed a shelf life 2 days longer than the control bread. The 
organic acid quantification indicated a higher production of acetic acid 
(33.8 ± 4.4 mM) when compared to other sourdough breads. Addition of 4% of 
sucrose to sourdough fermentation with L. brevis increased the mould free 
shelf-life of bread challenged with A. niger by 6 days. The combination of L. 
hammesii sourdough and the addition of ricinoleic acid (0.15% or 0.08%) 
prolonged the mould free shelf-life by 7-8 days for breads produced with wheat 
sourdoughs. In conclusion, the in vitro MIC of bacterial metabolites and 
preservatives matched the in situ antifungal effect. Of the different bacterial 
metabolites evaluated, acetic acid had the most prominent and consistent 
antifungal activity. The use of sourdough fermentation with selected strains 
able to produce acetic acid allowed reducing the use of chemical preservatives.

BACKGROUND: The prognoses widely reported for pancreatic cancer reflect the very 
poor survival associated with the most common histological type, exocrine 
adenocarcinoma. We calculated life expectancies for patients with less common 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), and also for the subsets of these 
patients who survive 1 and 5 years post-diagnosis, all of which carry a 
significantly better prognosis. Results for 1- and 5-year PNET survivors appear 
not to have been previously reported, nor have life expectancies (average 
long-term survival times) been given.
METHODS: We identified 5287 cases of PNET in the SEER US national database, 
1973-2013. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to compute empirical survival 
probabilities and median survival times for functioning (n = 279) and 
non-functioning PNET (n = 5008) cases. The Cox proportional hazards regression 
model was used to examine univariate associations of survival with covariates 
including patient age, sex, race, cancer stage, tumor grade, surgical treatment, 
and calendar year. A multivariate multiplicative hazard Poisson regression model 
estimated mortality rates for all combinations of the covariates. The rates were 
used to construct actuarial life tables, which gave life expectancies for male 
and female patients according to age, cancer stage, tumor grade, histology 
(functioning versus non-functioning), surgical treatment status, and time since 
diagnosis. These life expectancies were compared with age- and sex-specific 
figures from the US general population.
RESULTS: Life expectancy in PNET is lower than that of the US general population 
and varies significantly according to patient age, cancer stage, tumor grade, 
mode of treatment, and time since diagnosis. For example, it is near normal for 
persons aged 70 and older who undergo surgical resection of localized 
well-differentiated (i.e., grade I) tumors. By contrast, persons with metastatic 
high-grade tumors not amenable to surgery have life expectancies of only 1 to 4 
years depending on patient age. Functioning PNETs were associated with somewhat 
lower mortality than non-functioning within the first few years after diagnosis, 
though no major differences were observed long-term. Positive factors for 
survival were younger age, localized stage, low tumor grade, and surgical 
treatment. Survival improved over the 1973-2013 study period: on average 
mortality rates fell by 1.2% per year after controlling for changes in the 
patient population. Life expectancy increased markedly with time since 
diagnosis: those surviving 1 and 5 years post-diagnosis had longer additional 
life expectancies.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancies of patients with PNETs may be markedly reduced 
from normal, but even in the worst cases their prognoses remain significantly 
better than that of patients with the more common pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In 
some very favorable cases, the life expectancy is near-normal, especially 
amongst 1- and 5-year survivors. This information can be used to counsel 
patients.

In the surgical management of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) we aim to 
resect the tumour with clear margins in all planes. The aim of this study was to 
identify and compare overall survival in a group of 591 patients who had 
resections, and to relate this to the clearance of margins at the tumour bed. We 
used life tables to calculate survival at one, two, three, five, and 10 years 
after diagnosis by margin (clear=5mm or more; close=2-5mm; and involved=less 
than 2mm). Kaplan-Meier curves were produced for the margins alone, which were 
defined as clear in 480 patients (81%), close in 63 (11%), and involved in 48 
(8%). Five-year survival was 81%, 75%, and 54% for clear, close, and involved 
margins, respectively, which highlights the importance of clear margins for 
survival. There is a significant prognostic implication associated with close, 
and particularly with involved, margins.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have changed the landscape of treatment for 
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) leading to a life expectancy 
comparable to the general population. Side effects commonly encountered during 
TKI treatment are pleural effusion due to use of dasatinib and vascular side 
effects due to nilotinib and ponatinib. Coronary artery spasm (CAS), although 
encountered during treatment with other chemotherapeutic drugs, have to our 
knowledge never been reported during TKI treatment. Here, we describe two cases 
of coronary artery spasms which are likely due to TKIs.

Sciences and Research, Ambala, Haryana, India.

BACKGROUND: With the increase in life expectancy, the number of older persons is 
constantly rising. Disability rates for elderly people are also on the rise with 
an increase in the burden of chronic diseases depriving them of independence and 
the performance of activities of daily living. The study aimed to estimate the 
prevalence of physical disability and determine its correlates among elderly 
population of rural Haryana.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted 
among 322 elderly participants aged 60 years and above in the rural area of 
Haryana, India. Data pertaining to sociodemographic profile, self-reported 
chronic diseases/ailments, and disability assessment by means of Barthel and 
Katz index of activities of daily living was collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: Overall, 21.4% and 18% elderly people had some form of disability 
according to the Barthel index and Katz index, respectively. With aging, 
disability increased and 52.5% of the elderly aged 75 years and above were found 
to have disability according to the Barthel's index. Females (P = 0.014), those 
who were currently not married (P = 0.001), currently unemployed (P = 0.001), 
and those with chronic diseases/ailments (P = 0.002), had significantly higher 
disability rates. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed age 75 years and 
above, current unemployment, and the presence of three or more chronic 
diseases/ailments as significant factors related to physical disability.
CONCLUSION: Disability is associated with increasing age and an increase in the 
burden of chronic health ailments in the elderly. Consequently, there is the 
need to prioritize preventive, promotive, curative, and rehabilitative services 
for the geriatric population.

Introduction: Lolland-Falster consists of two islands in the southern part of 
Denmark where income is lower and life expectancy is shorter than in the general 
Danish population. It is a mixed rural-provincial area with approximately 
100,000 inhabitants. The Lolland-Falster Health Study was initiated to gain 
knowledge on the determinants of health in this disadvantaged area. Methods: The 
study is a household-based prospective cohort study including people of all 
ages. The entire household of randomly selected inhabitants is allocated either 
to an invited group or to an uninvited, non-contacted control group. The data 
collection encompasses questionnaires, physical examination and biological 
samples, i.e. blood and urine for same-day analysis and biobank storage, and 
saliva and faeces also for biobank storage. The civil registration number links 
collected data for each individual, family and household, with information in 
Danish registers. The data collection started in February 2016 and is estimated 
to end by 2019 after the enrolment of 20,000 people. Analysis: A number of 
in-depth sub-studies are planned. Emphasis will be given to analysis of intra- 
and inter-family variations in health determinants, genetics, lifestyle and 
health status. Ethics: Region Zealand's Ethical Committee on Health Research 
(SJ-421) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (REG-24-2015) approved the study. 
Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02482896). Strength and limitations 
of this study: The strength of this study is that Lolland-Falster Health Study 
is a useful scientific resource for investigating cross-sectional difference and 
time trends within and between individuals, families and households. LOFUS adds 
diversity to the previously collected Danish population studies in urbanized 
areas. The limitation is that data collection is expensive. Conclusions: LOFUS 
will contribute to the knowledge on health in disadvantaged, rural-provincial 
areas.

: Cardiomyopathies and channelopathies are heterogeneous disorders that increase 
the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator 
(ICD) therapy is safe and effective for preventing SCD in patients at risk for 
malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Because of the poor positive predictive value 
of current risk stratification tools, the majority of patients implanted with an 
ICD will never receive a life-saving therapy but will be exposed to the risk of 
complications such as device infection, lead failure and inappropriate therapy. 
Subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) now constitutes a valuable alternative to conventional 
transvenous ICD in patients with cardiomyopathies and channelopathies as it 
provides protection from SCD while avoiding the risks of intravascular lead 
infection or failure. This may be particularly advantageous for young patients 
with a very long life expectancy. On the other hand, S-ICD cannot deliver 
antitachycardia pacing or antibradycardia pacing. The purpose of this article is 
to review the available evidence and the future perspectives of S-ICD therapy in 
patients with cardiomyopathies or channelopathies.

Emissions from power plants in China and India contain a myriad of fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5, PM ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter) precursors, posing 
significant health risks among large, densely settled populations. Studies 
isolating the contributions of various source classes and geographic regions are 
limited in China and India, but such information could be helpful for policy 
makers attempting to identify efficient mitigation strategies. We quantified the 
impact of power generation emissions on annual mean PM2.5 concentrations using 
the state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry model WRF-Chem (Weather Research 
Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry) in China and India. Evaluations using 
nationwide surface measurements show the model performs reasonably well. We 
calculated province-specific annual changes in mortality and life expectancy due 
to power generation emissions generated PM2.5 using the Integrated Exposure 
Response (IER) model, recently updated IER parameters from Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) 2015, population data, and the World Health Organization (WHO) 
life tables for China and India. We estimate that 15 million (95% Confidence 
Interval (CI): 10 to 21 million) years of life lost can be avoided in China each 
year and 11 million (95% CI: 7 to 15 million) in India by eliminating power 
generation emissions. Priorities in upgrading existing power generating 
technologies should be given to Shandong, Henan, and Sichuan provinces in China, 
and Uttar Pradesh state in India due to their dominant contributions to the 
current health risks.

BACKGROUND: Constrained optimization methods are already widely used in health 
care to solve problems that represent traditional applications of operations 
research methods, such as choosing the optimal location for new facilities or 
making the most efficient use of operating room capacity.
OBJECTIVES: In this paper we illustrate the potential utility of these methods 
for finding optimal solutions to problems in health care delivery and policy. To 
do so, we selected three award-winning papers in health care delivery or policy 
development, reflecting a range of optimization algorithms. Two of the three 
papers are reviewed using the ISPOR Constrained Optimization Good Practice 
Checklist, adapted from the framework presented in the initial Optimization Task 
Force Report. The first case study illustrates application of linear programming 
to determine the optimal mix of screening and vaccination strategies for the 
prevention of cervical cancer. The second case illustrates application of the 
Markov Decision Process to find the optimal strategy for treating type 2 
diabetes patients for hypercholesterolemia using statins. The third paper 
(described in Appendix 1) is used as an educational tool. The goal is to 
describe the characteristics of a radiation therapy optimization problem and 
then invite the reader to formulate the mathematical model for solving it. This 
example is particularly interesting because it lends itself to a range of 
possible models, including linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer programming 
formulations. From the case studies presented, we hope the reader will develop 
an appreciation for the wide range of problem types that can be addressed with 
constrained optimization methods, as well as the variety of methods available.
CONCLUSIONS: Constrained optimization methods are informative in providing 
insights to decision makers about optimal target solutions and the magnitude of 
the loss of benefit or increased costs associated with the ultimate clinical 
decision or policy choice. Failing to identify a mathematically superior or 
optimal solution represents a missed opportunity to improve economic efficiency 
in the delivery of care and clinical outcomes for patients. The ISPOR 
Optimization Methods Emerging Good Practices Task Force's first report provided 
an introduction to constrained optimization methods to solve important clinical 
and health policy problems. This report also outlined the relationship of 
constrained optimization methods relative to traditional health economic 
modeling, graphically illustrated a simple formulation, and identified some of 
the major variants of constrained optimization models, such as linear 
programming, dynamic programming, integer programming, and stochastic 
programming. The second report illustrates the application of constrained 
optimization methods in health care decision making using three case studies. 
The studies focus on determining optimal screening and vaccination strategies 
for cervical cancer, optimal statin start times for diabetes, and an educational 
case to invite the reader to formulate radiation therapy optimization problems. 
These illustrate a wide range of problem types that can be addressed with 
constrained optimization methods.

BACKGROUND: Several public cord blood banks are struggling financially, and the 
question remains as to whether additional allocations of funds to them are 
justified.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the social benefits of public cord blood bank inventory 
net of cord blood banks' operational costs.
METHODS: We used publicly available data from the Health Resources and Service 
Administration on the number of annual cord blood transplants as well as the 
patient age distribution in 2010, and the survival estimates between 2008 and 
2012 for the several diseases treated by cord blood transplantation. Data on 
aggregate annual costs to the cord blood industry for recruitment, processing, 
and storage were obtained from published work. We used estimated increases in 
life expectancy due to treatment using umbilical cord blood and value for 
life-years gained to estimate the social benefits of the public cord blood 
inventory annually.
RESULTS: We found that the annual social benefits of between $500 million and 
$1.5 billion outweigh the current operational annual costs of running cord blood 
banks of $60 to $70 million by a significant margin.
CONCLUSIONS: We estimated that the annual social benefit of having a cord blood 
system far outweighs its costs, by more than an order of magnitude. Thus, the 
social benefits of maintaining the US public cord blood banking system at the 
present time far outweigh the costs of collecting, storing, and distributing 
cord blood. This suggests that there is a potential justification for government 
intervention to align social benefits and costs. Nevertheless, simple fixes may 
produce unintended consequences, and so a careful design for subsidies is 
needed.

BACKGROUND: A quality-adjusted life-year is a common unit of measurement in 
health valuation. Under its constant proportionality assumption, the value of a 
quality-adjusted life span is defined as the product of preference weight and 
life span.
OBJECTIVES: To empirically identify an alternative functional relationship 
between life span and value by relaxing the constant proportionality assumption.
METHODS: Using an online survey, 5367 respondents completed 30 to 40 paired 
comparisons where each involved a choice between two health outcomes: one with a 
longer life span and health problems (five-level EuroQol five-dimensional 
questionnaire) and the other with a shorter life span and no problems (time 
trade-off pair). Using 2670 pairs, a saturated model with indicator variables 
for 27 life spans and 90 health problems of varying duration and severity was 
estimated by maximum likelihood. Its coefficients empirically illustrate the 
relationship between life span and value on a quality-adjusted life-year scale.
RESULTS: The results reject constant proportionality (P < 0.01) and support the 
use of a power function to describe the relationship between life span and 
value, namely, value = preference weight × life spanβ. The estimate of power (β 
= 0.415; 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.42) appears to depend on whether life 
span was expressed in a temporal unit of days (0.403), weeks (0.509), months 
(0.541), or years (0.654).
CONCLUSIONS: Raising life span to a power less than 1 implies decreasing 
marginal value of life span and greatly improved model fit, and confirms 
previous violations of proportionality. This power function may replace 
conventional assumptions in health valuation studies. Nevertheless, governmental 
agencies may favor a longer time horizon than that of the general population.

Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease has become a very significant problem in the 
current era that is very likely to worsen due to increasing life expectancy. The 
enormous potential of smart mobile devices has attracted researchers and medical 
practitioners alike to develop and provide M-health solutions for Alzheimer's. 
In this paper, we explore, analyze and investigate the works that have attempted 
to develop M-health applications for Alzheimer's over the last 10 years in order 
to highlight current and future directions, which it is hoped will assist 
medical practitioners and researchers to provide more solutions for fighting 
Alzheimer's.
METHODS: A systematic review approach was used in this study. Google Scholar is 
considered for searching the published papers for academic mobile applications 
and Google PlayStore is considered for non-academic mobile applications. More 
than 900 titles of various papers were reviewed. The selection of the papers was 
dictated by a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Current directions are identified by presenting the services and 
functions that are provided by M-health applications for Alzheimer's patients 
and the technologies that are used to do so. Current services are classified 
into four groups and the future directions for each of these groups are 
presented.
CONCLUSIONS: Numerous M-health applications that fight against Alzheimer's have 
been surveyed and analyzed by using scientific methodology in which inclusion 
and exclusion criteria have been used. Based on this analysis, we were able to 
present the current research foci and define potential future research 
directions.

OBJECTIVES: Rural disparities in age-adjusted mortality are growing in the 
United States. While socioeconomic variables have been found to explain 
significant variation in life expectancy across US counties, previous research 
has not examined the role of socioeconomic variables in explaining rural 
mortality disparities. The purpose of this study was to quantify the rural 
mortality disparity after controlling for socioeconomic variables.
METHODS: Recursive partitioning, or tree regression, was used to fit models 
predicting premature mortality across counties in the United States, adjusted 
for age, median income, and percent in poverty in 4 time periods (from 2004 to 
2012) with and without inclusion of an urban-rural variable.
RESULTS: We found median income and percent in poverty explained about 50% of 
the variation in age-adjusted premature mortality rates across US counties in 
each of the four time periods. After controlling for these socioeconomic 
variables, rural mortality disparities largely disappeared, explaining less than 
2% of the variance in premature mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Addressing poverty and other socioeconomic issues should be a 
priority to improve health in rural communities. Interventions designed to 
target social determinants of health in rural areas are needed to address the 
growing rural mortality disparity that is largely explained by measures of 
poverty and income. Researchers examining rural health disparities should 
routinely include socioeconomic variables in their analyses.

OBJECTIVE: To determine follow-up practice patterns of US patients with 
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and their concordance 
with 4 clinical practice guidelines.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of adult patients using the 
OptumLabs Data Warehouse database, we identified those who had an incident 
diagnosis of MGUS from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2013, no history or 
subsequent diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic malignancy, and at least 2 years of 
follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 11,676 patients with MGUS were included in the study. During 
the first 2 years after MGUS diagnosis, the distribution of patients by mean 
interval between visits was as follows: less than 6 months, 12.7%; every 6 to 12 
months, 25.2%; every 13 to 24 months, 17.7%; and longer than 24 months, 44.4%. A 
higher proportion of patients were followed up at intervals of less than 13 
months over time, from 32.7% to 41.1% (P<.001). Patients 60 years or older were 
more likely to be followed up at intervals of less than 13 months; those from 
the Northeast or younger than 50 years were more likely to be followed up at 
intervals longer than 24 months compared with their counterparts (P<.001). More 
than half of the patients 80 years or older were followed up at intervals of 
less than 6 months (12.3%), 6 to 12 months (27.8%), or 13 to 24 months (18.2%). 
Only approximately half of the patients (41.1%-58.8%) with MGUS diagnosed in 
2013 were concordant with any of the 4 clinical guidelines.
CONCLUSION: The MGUS follow-up practice patterns varied geographically and 
demographically and were frequently discordant with guideline recommendations. A 
large proportion of patients with limited life expectancy had frequent follow-up 
visits.

Iron overload disorders lead to excess iron deposition in the body, which can 
occur as a result of genetic or secondary causes. Genetic iron overload, 
referred to as hereditary hemochromatosis, may present as a common autosomal 
recessive mutation or as one of several uncommon mutations. Secondary iron 
overload may result from frequent blood transfusions, exogenous iron intake, or 
certain hematological diseases such as dyserythropoietic syndrome or chronic 
hemolytic anemia. Iron overload may be asymptomatic, or may present with 
significant diseases of the liver, heart, endocrine glands, joints, or other 
organs. If treated appropriately prior to end-organ damage, life expectancy has 
been shown to be similar compared to matched populations. Alongside clinical 
assessment, diagnostic studies involve blood tests, imaging, and in some cases 
liver biopsy. The mainstay of therapy is periodic phlebotomy, although oral 
chelation is an option for selected patients.

University of Oxford, Oxford, UK (BD).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the external validity of mapping algorithms for predicting 
EQ-5D-3L utility values from EORTC QLQ-C30 responses not previously validated 
and to assess whether statistical models not previously applied are better 
suited for mapping the EORTC QLQ-C30 to the EQ-5D-3L.
METHODS: In total, 3866 observations for 1719 patients from a longitudinal study 
(Cancer 2015) were used to validate existing algorithms. Predictive accuracy was 
compared to previously validated algorithms using root mean squared error, mean 
absolute error across the EQ-5D-3L range, and for 10 tumor-type specific samples 
as well as using differences between estimated quality-adjusted life years. 
Thirteen new algorithms were estimated using a subset of the Cancer 2015 data 
(3203 observations for 1419 patients) applying various linear, response mapping, 
beta, and mixture models. Validation was performed using 2 data sets composed of 
patients with varying disease severity not used in the estimation and all 
available algorithms ranked on their performance.
RESULTS: None of the 5 existing algorithms offer an improvement in predictive 
accuracy over preferred algorithms from previous validation studies. Of the 
newly estimated algorithms, a 2-part beta model performed the best across the 
validation criteria and in data sets composed of patients with different levels 
of disease severity. Validation results did, however, vary widely between the 2 
data sets, and the most accurate algorithm appears to depend on health state 
severity as the distribution of observed EQ-5D-3L values varies. Linear models 
performed better for patients in relatively good health, whereas beta, mixture, 
and response mapping models performed better for patients in worse health.
CONCLUSION: The most appropriate mapping algorithm to apply in practice may 
depend on the disease severity of the patient sample whose utility values are 
being predicted.

BACKGROUND: People with HIV infection in the United States are often affected by 
chronic viral hepatitis. These coinfected people with either HBV or HCV are at 
increased risk for serious, life-threatening complications. Coinfections with 
viral hepatitis may also complicate the delivery of anti-retroviral therapy 
(ART) by escalating the risk of drug-related hepatoxicity. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 10 percent of 
people with HIV in the United States also have HBV, and 25 percent also have HCV 
coinfection. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and 
the increased life-expectancy of HIV patients, clinicians are more likely to be 
confronted with issues related to co-infection and the management challenges 
that they present, especially in resource-limited settings. The purpose of this 
analysis was to identify geographical clusters of HIV- (HBV/HCV) co-infection 
and compared to the geographical clusters of not co-infected using DC, 
Department of Health surveillance data. The results of the analysis will be used 
to target resources to areas at risk.
METHODS: HIV and Hepatitis surveillance data were matched among cases diagnosed 
between 1980 and 2016. HIV-hepatitis co-infected and the not co-infected spatial 
clusters were detected using discrete Poisson model. Kulldorff's spatial scan 
statistic method was implemented in the free software tool called SaTScan which 
has been widely adopted for detecting disease cluster. The analysis was 
conducted by tracts, but for visualization, ease of interpretation and assist in 
policy making the tract map was overlaid with the ward map using ArcGIS 10.5.1.
RESULTS: Between 1980 and 2016, there were 12,965 diagnosed cases of HIV, of 
which 2,316 HIV/Hepatitis matches were identified. Of the 2316 co-infected 
people living in DC, 25 percent (N = 590) of people had HBV, and 75 percent (N = 
1,726) had HCV. Out of 12,965 diagnosed cases, remaining 10,649 did not have any 
co-infections (not co-infected). IDU (27.16 percent) and MSM (32.86 percent) 
were the highest mode of transmission for co-infected population. 
African-American were reported 83.64 percent (N = 1,937) among co-infection 
population. Three clusters were identified for both co-infected population in 
DC. The largest cluster radius for co-infected analysis covers wards 6, 7 and 8 
as well as large parts of 2 and 5 (p < 0.001). Multiple clusters were identified 
for not co-infected population (p < 0.001). IDU (n = 450) was the highest mode 
of transmission for the co-infected clusters. For all clusters combined of not 
co-infected population highest mode of transmission were MSM (n = 2,534). This 
analysis also showed racial disparity, economic deprivation and lack of 
education were prominent in the co-infected clusters.
CONCLUSION: We identified locations of high risk clusters where enhanced 
hepatitis and HIV prevention, treatment, and care can help combat the epidemic. 
The clusters radius expands into the neighboring state of Maryland as well. The 
findings from this analysis will be used to target area based public health 
policy and healthcare interventions for HIV-hepatitis. It is recommended based 
on the analysis that needle exchange programs can successfully control new HIV 
infections as well as hepatitis co-infections.

BACKGROUND: Portuguese-speaking countries (PSC) share the influence of the 
Portuguese culture but have socioeconomic development patterns that differ from 
that of Portugal.
OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and 
mortality in the PSC between 1990 and 2016, stratified by sex, and their 
association with the respective sociodemographic indexes (SDI).
METHODS: This study used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 data and 
methodology. Data collection followed international standards for death 
certification, through information systems on vital statistics and mortality 
surveillance, surveys, and hospital registries. Techniques were used to 
standardize causes of death by the direct method, as were corrections for 
underreporting of deaths and garbage codes. To determine the number of deaths 
due to each cause, the CODEm (Cause of Death Ensemble Model) algorithm was 
applied. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and SDI (income per capita, 
educational attainment and total fertility rate) were estimated for each 
country. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: There are large differences, mainly related to socioeconomic
