Biofilm plays important roles in the life cycle of Bacillus species, such as 
promoting host and object surface colonization and resisting heavy metal stress. 
This study utilized transcriptomics to evaluate the impacts of cadmium on the 
components, morphology, and function of biofilms of Bacillus subtilis strain 
1JN2. Under cadmium ion stress, the morphology of the B. subtilis 1JN2 biofilm 
was flattened, and its mobility increased. Moreover, differential gene 
expression analysis showed that the main regulator of biofilm formation, Spo0A, 
decreased in expression under cadmium ion stress, thereby inhibiting 
extracellular polysaccharide synthesis through the SinI/SinR two-component 
regulatory system and the AbrB pathway. Cadmium ion treatment also increased the 
SigD content significantly, thereby increasing the expression of the flagella 
encoding and assembly genes in the strain. This promoted poly-γ-glutamic acid 
production via the DegS/DegU two-component regulatory system and the conversion 
of biofilm extracellular polysaccharide to poly-γ-glutamic acid. This conferred 
cadmium stress tolerance in the strain. Additionally, the cadmium ion-mediated 
changes in the biofilm composition affected the colonization of the strain on 
the host plant root surface. Cadmium ions also induced surfactin synthesis. 
These findings illustrate the potential of Bacillus species as biocontrol 
strains that can mitigate plant pathogenic infections and heavy metal stress. 
The results also provide a basis for the screening of multifunctional biocontrol 
strains.

Active packaging films based on gelatin with silver-kaolinite (Ag-Kln) were 
developed and their effects on the quality and microbial growth of beef meat 
stored in different packaging systems (cling film, vacuum and modified 
atmosphere packaging) at 4 °C for 13 days were evaluated. The analysis revealed 
that Ag-Kln packaging films had no adverse effects on the pH and colour of the 
beef samples irrespective of the packaging system used. Beef meat in packaging 
with active films lost more weight (P < 0.05) than without active films for meat 
in the vacuum and modified systems on day 13. In general, these gelatin films 
with Ag-Kln showed the potential as antibacterial films and could enhance the 
shelf life of food products, however, further studies are required to establish 
the release rate of silver from packaging films, as well as test the efficiency 
of these materials under different storage conditions. In conclusion, this study 
revealed that gelatin film with silver-kaolinite is a promising antibacterial 
agent and preservation material for food shelf life extension.

OBJECTIVE: Maintaining or improving regular walking speed can help extend 
healthy life expectancy and prevent frailty. The evaluation of walking speed can 
help individuals meet their daily exercise goals; therefore, it may be 
beneficial as a public health policy for residents to measure and evaluate their 
walking speed easily. This study aimed to verify the validity and reliability of 
a smartphone application for the 10-m walk test, measured in the general 
population.
METHODS: The study participants were men (n = 20) and women (n = 20) aged 65-85 
years. The 10-m walk tests were performed at the usual walking speed, using the 
stopwatch function of a newly developed smartphone application. A total of three 
10-m walk tests were performed simultaneously with the study participants and 
professional fitness instructors to evaluate the criterion-related validity and 
the test-retest reliability.
RESULTS: A strong positive correlation was found in the criterion-related 
validity by the study participants and professional staff for the average of the 
three trials {r = 0.961 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.927, 0.979]}. The 
results revealed good reliability, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 
0.712 (95% CI = 0.571, 0.823).
CONCLUSION: The smartphone application walking speed measurement method can be 
widely used by the general public and is useful for health promotion.

Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, Eagan, MN, USA.

PURPOSE: LGBTQ+ young adults smoke at disproportionately higher rates than their 
non-LGBTQ+ counterparts, but prevention efforts are limited. Furthermore, prior 
to This Free Life (TFL), no known campaigns target LGBTQ+ nondaily smokers. In 
this study Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota evaluated a local partnership 
extension of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products' 
TFL campaign.
METHODS: The intervention featured a variety of LGBTQ+-tailored events, 
social/digital media, and out-of-home media placed in locations with a high 
density of LGBTQ+ young adults. Cross-sectional surveys (n = 1215) were 
collected from LGBTQ+ young adult (18-26) nondaily smokers at 4 time points 
between 2016 and 2019. The national TFL campaign was tracked in a separate 
evaluation conducted by the FDA.
RESULTS: 43.0% of nondaily LGBTQ+ smokers reported awareness of the campaign (n 
= 522), and 63.4% of those also engaged with TFL (n = 330). Engagement was 
highest for gay, lesbian and transgender participants, and for Asian and 
Black/African American participants. Each additional instance of campaign 
engagement increased participants' odds of intending to quit smoking by 20% (AOR 
= 1.20; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.36). The relationship between campaign engagement and 
intention to quit was fully mediated by the campaign's impact on attitudes 
against smoking and perceived normative trends, but not by perceived behavioral 
control.
CONCLUSION: The local extension of TFL increased intentions to quit for LGBTQ+ 
nondaily smokers. Future research should further explore the relationship 
between perceived behavioral control and intentions to quit for nondaily 
smokers.

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a progressive disease of the blood 
vessels supplying the heart, which leads to coronary artery stenosis or 
obstruction and is life-threatening. Early diagnosis of CAD is essential for 
timely intervention. Imaging tests are widely used in diagnosing CAD, and 
artificial intelligence (AI) technology is used to shed light on the development 
of new imaging diagnostic markers.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate and summarize how AI algorithms are used in the 
development of diagnostic models of CAD with imaging markers.
METHODS: This scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
guideline. Eligible articles were searched in PubMed and Embase. Based on the 
predefined included criteria, articles on coronary heart disease were selected 
for this scoping review. Data extraction was independently conducted by two 
reviewers, and a narrative synthesis approach was used in the analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 46 articles were included in the scoping review. The most 
common types of imaging methods complemented by AI included single-photon 
emission computed tomography (15/46, 32.6%) and coronary computed tomography 
angiography (15/46, 32.6%). Deep learning (DL) (41/46, 89.2%) algorithms were 
used more often than machine learning algorithms (5/46, 10.8%). The models 
yielded good model performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, 
and AUC. However, most of the primary studies used a relatively small sample (n 
< 500) in model development, and only few studies (4/46, 8.7%) carried out 
external validation of the AI model.
CONCLUSION: As non-invasive diagnostic methods, imaging markers integrated with 
AI have exhibited considerable potential in the diagnosis of CAD. External 
validation of model performance and evaluation of clinical use aid in the 
confirmation of the added value of markers in practice.

study.

Fighting against tumors is an ongoing challenge in both medicinal and clinical 
applications. In recent years, chemotherapy, along with surgery, has 
significantly improved the situation to prolong life expectancy. Theoretically, 
and regardless of dosage, we now have drugs that are strong enough to eliminate 
most tumors. However, due to uncontrollable drug distribution in the body, it is 
difficult to increase treatment efficiency by simply increasing dosages. For 
this reason, the need for a drug delivery system that can release "bombs" at the 
target organ or tissue as precisely as possible has elicited the interest of 
researchers. In our work, we design and construct a silica-based nanocomposite 
to meet the above demand. The novel nanocomposite drug carrier can be guided to 
target tumors or tissue by a magnetic field, since it is constructed with 
superparamagnetic Fe3O4 as the core. The Fe3O4 core is clad in a mesoporous 
silica molecular sieve MCM-41 (represented as MS, in this article), since this 
MS has enormous ordered hexagonal caves providing sufficient space to hold the 
drug molecules. To modify the magnetically guided carriers so that they become 
both magnetically guided and light-responsive, benzophenone hydrazone is coupled 
into the molecular sieve tunnel. When a certain wavelength of light is imposed 
on the gating molecules, C=N double bonds vibrate and swing, causing the cavity 
that holds the drug molecules to change size and open the tunnels. Hence, the 
nanocomposite has the ability to release loaded drugs with light irradiation. 
The structure, loading abilities, and the size of the nanocomposite are 
inspected with a scanning electron microscope, a transmission electron 
microscope, thermogravimetry analysis, N2 adsorption/desorption, and dynamic 
light scattering The biocompatibility and in vitro drug molecule controlled 
release are tested with an SMMC-7721 cell line.

Major medical advances in antibiotics for infectious diseases have dramatically 
improved the quality of life and greatly increased life expectancy. 
Nevertheless, the widespread and inappropriate exploitation of antibacterial 
agents has resulted in the emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MDR). 
Consequently, the study of new drugs for the treatment of diseases associated 
with multi-drug-resistant bacteria and the development of new treatments are 
urgently needed. Inspiringly, due to the advantages of a wide antimicrobial 
spectrum, fast sterilization, low resistance, and little damage to host tissues 
and normal flora, antibacterial photodynamic therapy (APDT), which is based on 
the interaction between light and a nontoxic photosensitizer (PS) concentrated 
at the lesion site to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), has become one of 
the most promising antibacterial strategies. Recently, a burgeoning APDT based 
on a variety of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) such as PS and near-infrared 
(NIR) light has been fully integrated in antibacterial applications and achieved 
excellent performances. Meanwhile, conjugated nanoparticles have been frequently 
reported in UCNP design, including surface-modified PS conjugates, antibiotic-PS 
conjugates, and dual or multiple antibacterial modal PS conjugates. This article 
provides an overview of the state-of-the-art design and bactericidal effects of 
UCNPs and their based APDTs. The first part discusses the design and mechanisms 
for UCNPs currently implemented in biomedicine. The second part focuses on the 
applications and antimicrobial effects of diverse APDT based on UCNPs in 
antibacterial-related infectious diseases.

The development of safe and effective therapeutic interventions is an important 
issue for delaying aging and reducing the risk of aging-related diseases. 
Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of aging and other complex diseases 
are desired due to their multiple components and targets. Through screening for 
effects on lifespan of 836 Chinese herbal medicine extracts, Nicandra physalodes 
extract (HL0285) was found to exhibit lifespan extension activity in 
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). In further experiments, HL0285 improved 
healthspan, enhanced stress resistance, and delayed the progression of 
neurodegenerative diseases in C. elegans. Additionally, it ameliorated 
senescence in human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) and reversed liver function 
damage and reduced senescence marker levels in doxorubicin- (Dox-) induced aging 
mice. In addition, the longevity effect of HL0285 in C. elegans was dependent on 
the DAF-16 and HSF-1 signaling pathways, as demonstrated by the results of the 
mutant lifespan, gene level, and GFP level assays. In summary, we discovered 
that HL0285 had an antiaging effect in C. elegans, MRC-5 cells, and Dox-induced 
aging mice and deserves to be explored in the future studies on antiaging 
agents.

Neuroshcistosomiasis is a life-threatening complication of schistosomiasis. Its 
prevalence in endemic populations is believed to be underreported at 1-4%. We 
report a four-year-old child who came to our hospital relatively late since the 
presentation of weakness and incontinence. MRI revealed long segment (T12-L1) 
ill-defined intramedullary lesions with cord extension having patchy 
enhancements. Despite the administration of both praziquantel and pulse 
prednisolone treatment, there was no convincing result. We thus question the 
role of steroids and praziquantel in individuals with late-diagnosed spinal 
schistosomiasis.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Cutaneous Squamous cell carcinoma(cSCC) represents 
approximately 16% of scalp tumors. Overall, cSCC is significantly more common in 
the oropharyngeal mucosa than the skin. Smoking is a risk factor for mucosal 
lesions, risk factors for developing cutaneous SCC include age, ultraviolet 
light exposure, chronic scarring, history of ionizing radiation, androgenetic 
alopecia (in men), and immunosuppression. The rates of bone invasion in 
cutaneous SCC have not been well noted in the literature.
CASE REPORT: We report a case of 57-year-old man with invasive squamous cell 
carcinoma of scalp with extension into bone, cortex and dura mater. Gross total 
removal of the tumor with extension of bony defect followed by repair of dura 
and repair of skin defect by VY advancement flap was done under general 
anaesthesia. At a 3-month follow-up, his wound is well healed. No evidence of 
metastasis is noted.
DISCUSSION: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common 
non-melanoma skin cancer, and its incidence is steadily increasing. Although the 
majority of cSCCs are successfully eradicated by surgical excision, advanced 
cSCC poses a significant risk in terms of morbidity, impact on quality of life, 
and risk of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of scalp is a rare 
entity. Invasion to bone, cortex, and dura mater is furthermore rare. Therefore, 
proper management of advanced cSCC is of the utmost importance since local 
invasion, delayed diagnosis, and metastasis contribute to increased costs and 
morbidity. A multi-disciplinary team approach is recommended.

The primary cilium is a sensory organelle, receiving signals from the external 
environment and relaying them into the cell. Mutations in proteins required for 
transport in the primary cilium result in ciliopathies, a group of genetic 
disorders that commonly lead to the malformation of organs such as the kidney, 
liver and eyes and skeletal dysplasias. The motor proteins dynein-2 and 
kinesin-2 mediate retrograde and anterograde transport, respectively, in the 
cilium. WDR34 (also known as DYNC2I2), a dynein-2 intermediate chain, is 
required for the maintenance of cilia function. Here, we investigated WDR34 
mutations identified in Jeune syndrome, short-rib polydactyly syndrome and 
asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia patients. There is a poor correlation between 
genotype and phenotype in these cases, making diagnosis and treatment highly 
complex. We set out to define the biological impacts on cilia formation and 
function of WDR34 mutations by stably expressing the mutant proteins in 
WDR34-knockout cells. WDR34 mutations led to different spectrums of phenotypes. 
Quantitative proteomics demonstrated changes in dynein-2 assembly, whereas 
initiation and extension of the axoneme, localization of intraflagellar

Approximately 17,000 new spinal cord injuries occur each year in the United 
States, with motor vehicle collisions and falls being the most common causes. 
Even though 94% of patients survive the initial injury and corresponding 
hospitalization, their life expectancy is reduced secondary to the long-term 
complications that stem from their injury. Every patient should be approached in 
the same manner (i.e., as if they have a spinal cord injury) until proven 
otherwise to prevent additional injury. Important considerations that should 
take place in the emergency department include the patient's airway, the 
presence of shock, and the prevention of complications secondary to the primary 
injury. This article briefly summarizes the epidemiology and pathophysiology of 
spinal cord injuries and the therapies that may be recommended and initiated 
following a thorough assessment of the patient.

A ruptured arterial aneurysm, especially in the aorta, represents one of the 
most acute and mortal conditions encountered in clinical medicine. 
Population-based screening in elderly men, treatment of risk factors, such as 
hypertension, and endovascular or open repair of rupture-prone lesions, 
represent cornerstones in management. Surgical repair has a sizeable effect on 
life-expectancy, but medical therapy that retards aneurysm growth still 
represents a considerable and unmet clinical need. In the current review we 
survey recent findings implicating the mechano-responsive transcriptional 
co-activators YAP and TAZ in protection from aneurysm development. Arteries from 
mouse mutants that lack YAP and TAZ in vascular smooth muscle respond 
inadequately to mechanical stimulation, and they develop aneurysms characterized 
by elastin fragmentation, proteoglycan infiltration, and severe inflammation at 
breathtaking speed. This seems to be due, at least in part, to unscheduled 
activation of STING (stimulator of interferon genes), an arm of innate immunity 
that responds to double-stranded DNA in the cytoplasm. YAP and TAZ protect from 
STING activation by securing nuclear integrity. These novel insights suggest 
unanticipated medical therapies for sporadic and genetic aneurysms alike, 
involving inhibition of kinases in the Hippo pathway using small molecules, or 
inhibition of STING signaling itself. Translation of these novel findings into 
clinical therapies now represents an important priority.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in older patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). 
Current guidelines recommend oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) except in case of 
severe frailty or reduced life expectancy, but definitive evidence on which 
"frailty" tools may help to identify older AF patients expected to derive little 
or no benefit from OAT is still lacking. Some persistent uncertainties may 
derive from the different clinical implications that the two major models of 
frailty, namely the frail phenotype (FP) and the deficit accumulation model 
(DAM), underlie. We thus conducted a systematic review of published studies to 
examine the association of the presence of frailty, categorized according to the 
FP and DAM, with 1) OAT prescription and 2) incidence of clinical outcomes 
(all-cause mortality, stroke and/or systemic embolism and major or clinically 
relevant non-major bleeding) in patients receiving OAT.
METHODS: Embase and MEDLINE were searched from inception until May 31st, 2022, 
for studies using a validated tool to identify frailty in subjects aged 65 years 
or older with a diagnosis of non-valvular AF; only studies on patients 
prescribed an OAT were considered eligible for the analyses involving clinical 
outcomes. The protocols for each review question have been registered in 
PROSPERO database (CRD42022308623 and CRD42022308628).
FINDINGS: Twenty-three studies exploring the association between frailty and OAT 
prescription on a total of 504 719 subjects were included. Patients with 
increasing severity of DAM frailty showed consistently lower OAT prescription 
rates than non-frail patients, whereas use of OAT did not significantly differ 
between patients with the FP compared with non-frail subjects. Eleven studies 
exploring the association between frailty and clinical outcomes on a total of 41 
985 individuals receiving oral anticoagulation were included. Compared with 
non-frail subjects, a higher risk of all-cause mortality and clinical outcomes 
could be observed for AF patients prescribed with OAT with severe frailty 
according to the DAM, with inconclusive findings for the FP. High levels of 
heterogeneity were observed in both groups of studies; therefore, a 
meta-analysis was not performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the great heterogeneity among different validated frailty 
measures, indiscriminately relying on "frailty" should not be regarded as the 
gold standard for clinical decision-making about stroke prevention in older AF 
patients. Present findings suggest that severe frailty according to the DAM is 
associated with less use of OAT and increased risk of all-cause mortality, 
thereby representing at the moment the most reasonable tool to efficiently 
recognize patients with limited life expectancy and for whom there is so far 
scant, if any, evidence of a clinical benefit of OAT.

OBJECTIVE: The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a severe disease caused 
by dysfunctional central thyroid hormone transport due to functional loss of the 
monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8). In this study, we assessed whether mice 
with concomitant deletion of the thyroid hormone transporters Mct8 and the 
organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp1c1) represent a valid preclinical 
model organism for the AHDS.
METHODS: We generated and metabolically characterized a new CRISPR/Cas9 
generated Mct8/Oatp1c1 double-knockout (dKO) mouse line for the clinical 
features observed in patients with AHDS.
RESULTS: We show that Mct8/Oatp1c1 dKO mice mimic key hallmarks of the AHDS, 
including decreased life expectancy, central hypothyroidism, peripheral 
hyperthyroidism, impaired neuronal myelination, impaired motor abilities and 
enhanced peripheral thyroid hormone action in the liver, adipose tissue, 
skeletal muscle and bone.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Mct8/Oatp1c1 dKO mice are a valuable model 
organism for the preclinical evaluation of drugs designed to treat the AHDS.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of mandatory lifejacket wear legislation on 
unintentional rock fishing-related drowning fatalities at declared high-risk 
rock platforms in New South Wales (NSW; Australia).
METHODS: Rock fishing-related drownings for the five years pre-legislation 
enactment (23 November 2011 to 22 November 2016) and five years post-legislation 
enactment (23 November 2016 to 22 November 2021) were compared. Google Earth was 
used to assess if drowning deaths occurred at declared areas under legislation. 
Binary logistic regression was used to analyse change in the number of deaths in 
declared areas pre-legislation/post-legislation.
RESULTS: Over the 10 years, 80 rock fishing drowning deaths occurred in New 
South Wales; 23 in declared areas pre-legislation and 13 post-legislation 
(-43.5%). The odds of a rock fishing drowning death occurring in a declared area 
pre-legislation was 2.3 times higher (95% CI 0.942 to 5.752; p=0.067).
CONCLUSION: Reductions in rock fishing deaths at declared areas were observed 
since the legislation's introduction, but were not significant. Greater 
enforcement and extension to other high-risk platforms may reduce deaths 
further.

BACKGROUND: Drowning is a complex health issue, where global agendas call for 
greater emphasis on multisectoral action, and engagement with sectors not yet 
involved in prevention efforts. Here, we explored the conceptual boundaries of 
drowning prevention in peer-review and grey literature, by reviewing the 
contexts, interventions, terminologies, concepts, planning models, and sector 
involvement, to identify opportunities for multisectoral action.
METHODS: We applied scoping review method and have reported against Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping 
Reviews checklist. We searched four electronic databases for peer-reviewed 
articles published on 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2020 and five databases for 
grey literature published on 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020. We applied the 
search term "drowning," and charted data addressing our research questions.
RESULTS: We included 737 peer-reviewed articles and 68 grey documents. 
Peer-publications reported situational assessments (n=478, 64.86%) and 
intervention research (n=259, 35.14%). Drowning was reported in the context of 
injury (n=157, 21.30%), commonly in childhood injury (n=72, 9.77%), mortality 
studies (n=60, 8.14%) and in grey documents addressing adolescent, child, 
environmental, occupational and urban health, refugee and migrant safety and 
disaster. Intervention research was mapped to World Health Organization 
recommended actions. The leading sectors in interventions were health, leisure, 
education and emergency services.
CONCLUSION: Although drowning is often described as a major health issue, the 
sectors and stakeholders involved are multifarious. The interventions are more 
often initiated by non-health sectors, meaning multisectoral action is critical. 
Framing drowning prevention to reinforce cobenefits for other health and 
development agendas could strengthen multisectoral action. Greater investment in 
partnerships with non-health sectors, encouraging joint planning and 
implementation, and creating systems for increased accountability should be a 
priority in future years.

To address the need for long-term efficacy and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) 
data for patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) treated with baricitinib 2 mg, a 
study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of baricitinib 2 mg in adult 
patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Data presented here provided efficacy and 
outcomes data for patients treated for 52 weeks. Patients who participated in 
the originating study, BREEZE-AD5 (NCT03435081), and met additional eligibility 
criteria could enroll in the multicenter, open-label, Phase 3, long-term 
extension study BREEZE-AD6 (NCT03559270). Patients received baricitinib 2 mg for 
the duration of BREEZE-AD6. In BREEZE-AD6, the proportion of patients who 
achieved a 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) and 
validated Investigator Global Assessment for AD (vIGA-AD™) of 0 (clear) or 1 
(almost clear) were assessed through 52 weeks, in addition to several PROs. At 
week 52, the proportion of patients treated with baricitinib 2 mg daily 
achieving EASI75 was 48.6% (70/144), and 31.3% (45/144) of patients achieved a 
vIGA-AD score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear). Improvements in PROs such as 
SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD, itch and sleep) scores, Dermatology Life 
Quality Index (DLQI) total score, and DLQI ≤5 response were observed, and these 
responses were sustained through 52 weeks. Long-term efficacy of baricitinib in 
patients with AD was demonstrated by both clinician and patient-reported outcome 
measures.

OBJECTIVE: The KEYNOTE-590 trial showed that individuals with advanced 
esophageal cancer who received Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as 
a first-line regimen achieved a significant extension of survival. However, this 
treatment option increases the financial burden on patients and the economic 
benefits remain to be further evaluated.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate 10-year survival of patients with 
esophageal cancer from the perspective of United States (US) Medicare payers. We 
evaluated the economics of Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the PD-L1 positive 
score (CPS ≥10) and any PD-L1 expression groups, respectively. We estimated 
total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and calculated incremental 
cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
explore the impact of uncertainties on the results. Subgroup analysis was also 
performed.
RESULTS: The analysis results showed that the ICER for pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone was $293,513.17/QALYs in the any PD-L1 
expression group. This exceeded the threshold of willingness to pay 
($150,000/QALYs). ICERs were most sensitive to the cost of pembrolizumab and the 
ICERs exceeded $150,000/QALYs in all subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that first-line pembrolizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy is not a cost-effective option for advanced esophageal cancer in 
the US, regardless of PD-L1 expression status.
