IMPORTANCE: Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that definitive 
therapy improves overall survival among patients with high-risk prostate cancer. 
However, many patients do not receive definitive therapy because of 
sociodemographic and health-related factors.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with receipt of nondefinitive therapy 
(NDT) among patients aged 70 years and younger with high-risk prostate cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study identified 72 036 patients 
aged 70 years and younger with high-risk prostate cancer and Charlson 
Comorbidity Index scores of 2 or less who were entered in the National Cancer 
Database between January 2004 and December 2014. Data analysis was conducted 
from November 2018 to December 2019.
EXPOSURE: Receipt of NDT as an initial treatment approach.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survival rates were compared based on receipt of 
definitive therapy or NDT, and sociodemographic and health-related factors were 
associated with the type of therapy received. Residual life expectancy was 
estimated from the National Center for Health Statistics to calculate 
person-years of life lost.
RESULTS: A total of 72 036 men with a median (range) age of 63 (30-70) years, 
Charlson Comorbidity Index scores of 2 or less, and high-risk prostate cancer 
without regional lymph node or distant metastatic disease were analyzed. Among 
eligible patients, 5252 (7.3%) received NDT as an initial therapeutic strategy. 
On univariate and multivariate analyses, NDT was associated with worse overall 
survival (univariate analysis hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 2.40-2.69; P < .001; 
multivariate analysis hazard ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.26-2.56; P < .001). Compared 
with patients with private insurance or managed care, those with no insurance, 
Medicaid, or Medicare were more likely to receive systemic therapy only (no 
insurance: odds ratio [OR], 3.34; 95% CI, 2.81-3.98; P < .001; Medicaid: OR, 
2.92; 95% CI, 2.48-3.43; P < .001; Medicare: OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20-1.53; 
P < .001) or no treatment (no insurance: OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 2.24-3.08; P < .001; 
Medicaid: OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.45-2.01; P < .001; Medicare: OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 
1.04-1.24; P = .004). Compared with white patients, black patients were more 
likely to receive systemic therapy only (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.74-2.14; P < .001) 
or no treatment (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.32-1.61; P < .001), and Hispanic patients 
were more likely to receive systemic therapy only (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13-1.64; 
P = .001) or no treatment (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.14-1.60; P < .001). Between 2004 
and 2014, patients without insurance or enrolled in Medicaid had 1.83-fold 
greater person-years of life lost compared with patients with private insurance 
(area under the curve, 77 600 vs 42 300 person-years of life lost).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, receipt of NDT was associated with 
insurance status and race/ethnicity. While treatment decisions should be 
individualized for every patient, younger men with high-risk prostate cancer and 
minimal comorbidities should be encouraged to receive definitive local therapy 
regardless of other factors. These data suggest that significant barriers to 
life-extending treatment options for patients with prostate cancer remain.

PURPOSE: While guidelines support the use of maintenance bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin for patients with intermediate and high risk nonmuscle invasive 
bladder cancer, in an era of bacillus Calmette-Guérin shortage we explored the 
cost-effectiveness of maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guérin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model compared the cost-effectiveness of 
maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guérin to surveillance after induction bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin for intermediate/high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer 
from a U.S. Medicare perspective. Five-year oncologic outcomes, toxicity rates 
and utility values were extracted from the literature. Univariable and 
multivariable sensitivity analyses were conducted. A willingness to pay 
threshold of $100,000 per quality adjusted life year was considered 
cost-effective.
RESULTS: At 5 years mean costs per patient were $14,858 and $13,973 for 
maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guérin and surveillance, respectively, with 
quality adjusted life years of 4.046 for both, making surveillance the dominant 
strategy. On sensitivity analysis full dose and 1/3 dose maintenance bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin became cost-effective if the absolute reduction in 5-year 
progression was greater than 2.1% and greater than 0.76%, respectively. On 
further sensitivity analysis full dose and 1/3 dose maintenance bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin became cost-effective when maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guérin 
toxicity equaled surveillance toxicity. In multivariable sensitivity analyses 
using 100,000 Monte-Carlo microsimulations, full dose and 1/3 dose maintenance 
bacillus Calmette-Guérin was cost-effective in 17% and 39% of microsimulations, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Neither full dose nor 1/3 dose maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guérin 
appears cost-effective for the entire population of patients with 
intermediate/high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. These data support 
prioritizing maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guérin for the subset of patients 
with high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer most likely to experience 
progression, in particular those who tolerated induction bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin well. Overall, our findings support the American Urological 
Association policy statement to allocate bacillus Calmette-Guérin for induction 
rather than maintenance therapy during times of bacillus Calmette-Guérin 
shortage.

BACKGROUND: Brexanolone injection (BRX) was approved by the FDA in 2019 for the 
treatment of adult patients with postpartum depression (PPD), but its 
cost-effectiveness has not yet been evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of BRX compared with treatment 
with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for PPD.
METHODS: We projected costs (2018 U.S. dollars) and health (quality-adjusted 
life-years [QALYs]) for mothers treated with BRX or SSRIs and their children. A 
health state transition model projected clinical and economic outcomes for 
mothers based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, from a U.S. payer 
perspective. The modeled population consisted of adult patients with moderate to 
severe PPD, similar to BRX clinical trial patients. Short-term efficacy for BRX 
and SSRIs came from an indirect treatment comparison. Long-term efficacy 
outcomes over 4 weeks, 11 years (base case), and 18 years were based on results 
from an 18-year longitudinal study. Maternal health utility values came from 
analysis of trial-based short-form 6D responses. Other inputs were derived from 
the literature.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for BRX versus SSRIs was 
$106,662 per QALY gained over an 11-year time horizon. Drug and administration 
costs for BRX averaged $38,501, compared with $25 for SSRIs over the studied 
time horizon. Maternal total direct medical costs averaged $65,908 in the BRX 
arm, compared with $73,653 in the SSRI arm. BRX-treated women averaged 6.230 
QALYs compared with 5.979 QALYs for the SSRI arm. Adding partner costs and 
utilities in a sensitivity analysis further favored BRX. Results were sensitive 
to the severity of PPD at baseline and the model time horizon. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses indicated that BRX was cost-effective at the 
$150,000-per-QALY threshold with 58% probability.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis using a state transition model showed BRX to be a 
cost-effective therapy compared with SSRIs for treating women with PPD.

BACKGROUND: During the past decades, life expectancy has continued to increase 
in most high-income countries. Previous research suggests that improvements in 
life expectancy have primarily been driven by advances at the upper end of the 
health distribution, while parts of the population have lagged behind. Using 
data from the entire Swedish population, this study aims to examine the life 
expectancy development among subgroups of individuals with a history of common 
diseases relative to that of the general population.
METHODS: The remaining life expectancy at age 65 was estimated for each year in 
1998-2017 among individuals with a history of disease, and for the total Swedish 
population. We defined population subgroups as individuals with a history of 
myocardial infarction, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, hip fracture, or colon, 
breast, or lung cancer. We further distinguished between different educational 
levels and Charlson comorbidity index scores.
RESULTS: Life expectancy gains have been larger for men and women with a history 
of myocardial infarction, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and colon or breast 
cancer than for the general population. The life expectancy gap between 
individuals with a history of hip fracture or lung cancer and the general 
population has, however, been growing. Education and comorbidity have affected 
mortality levels, but have not altered the rate of increase in life expectancy 
among individuals with disease history. The female advantage in life expectancy 
was less pronounced among individuals with disease history than among the 
general population.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy has increased faster in many subpopulations with a 
history of disease than in the general population, while still remaining at 
lower levels. Improvements in life expectancy have been observed regardless of 
comorbidity or educational level. These findings suggest that the rise in 
overall life expectancy reflects more than just improved survival among the 
healthy or the delayed onset of disease.

BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by the loss of 
dystrophin. Severe and ultimately lethal, DMD progresses relatively slowly in 
that patients become wheelchair bound only around age twelve with a survival 
expectancy reaching the third decade of life.
METHODS: The mildly-affected mdx mouse model of DMD, and transgenic DysΔMTB-mdx 
and Fiona-mdx mice expressing dystrophin or utrophin, respectively, were exposed 
to either mild (scruffing) or severe (subordination stress) stress paradigms and 
profiled for their behavioral and physiological responses. A subgroup of mdx 
mice exposed to subordination stress were pretreated with the beta-blocker 
metoprolol.
FINDINGS: Subordination stress caused lethality in ∼30% of mdx mice within 24 h 
and ∼70% lethality within 48 h, which was not rescued by metoprolol. Lethality 
was associated with heart damage, waddling gait and hypo-locomotion, as well as 
marked up-regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. A novel 
cardiovascular phenotype emerged in mdx mice, in that scruffing caused a 
transient drop in arterial pressure, while subordination stress caused severe 
and sustained hypotension with concurrent tachycardia. Transgenic expression of 
dystrophin or utrophin in skeletal muscle protected mdx mice from scruffing and 
social stress-induced responses including mortality.
INTERPRETATION: We have identified a robust new stress phenotype in the 
otherwise mildly affected mdx mouse that suggests relatively benign handling may 
impact the outcome of behavioural experiments, but which should also expedite 
the knowledge-based therapy development for DMD.

INTRODUCTION: As HIV has become a manageable chronic condition, a renewed and 
increased interest in challenging traditional three-drug HIV therapies and 
moving toward two-drug regimens (2DR) for initial or maintenance treatment in 
people living with HIV (PLWH) has developed. As PLWH are living longer, 
continual advancements in antiretroviral regimens have been a focus to provide 
optimal life-long therapy options. Although early studies may have shown poor 
outcomes in virologic suppression with 2DR, newer studies and treatment options 
have emerged to show promise in the management of HIV. The purpose of this 
review is to evaluate current literature and assess the efficacy of two-drug 
(2DR) antiretroviral therapy in treatment-naïve and -experienced people living 
with HIV.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed between January 2009 to January 2020, 
using EMBASE, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and bibliographies. Combinations of the 
following search terms were used: HIV-1 infection, antiretroviral therapy, dual 
therapy, two-drug regimen, two-drug therapy, two-drug regimen, and 2DR. Included 
studies were those in the adult population with at least one active comparator, 
outcomes assessing HIV-1 RNA viral load while on treatment, and written in 
English.
RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were included, 13 where 2DRs were evaluated as 
initial therapy (3 studies with extension data) and 15 where 2DRs were evaluated 
as maintenance or switch therapy (2 studies with extension data).
CONCLUSION: Although 2DRs may not be appropriate in all patient populations, 
they are being utilized more frequently and have the potential to reduce costs, 
adverse effects, and drug interactions.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic non-squamous 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the United States (US) payers' 
perspective in the first-line treatment.
METHODS: A mathematical Markov model was developed to estimate cost and 
effectiveness of atezolizumab combination therapy versus carboplatin plus 
nab-paclitaxel alone in the first-line therapy of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC 
from the data of IMpower130. Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were analyzed, and model 
robustness was assessed by sensitivity analysis. Additional subgroup analyses 
were performed as well.
RESULTS: Compared to chemotherapy, treatment with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy 
yields an increase of 0.16 QALYs with an increase in cost of $109,809.13, 
resulting in an ICER of $670,309.66 per QALY. The most influential factor in 
this model was the cost of atezolizumab. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
showed that there was 0% probability that atezolizumab plus chemotherapy was 
cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) values of $150,000 per QALY. The 
results of subgroup analyses showed that the ICER remained greater than 
$150,000/QALY across the all patient subgroups.
CONCLUSION: First-line treatment with atezolizumab in combination with 
carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel is not a cost-effective option in patients with 
metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.

Implantable Devices for Single-Sided Deafness and Conductive or Mixed Hearing 
Loss: A Health Technology Assessment.

Ontario Health (Quality).

Collaborators: Lee C, Yeung MW, Falk L, Ali A, Walter M.

BACKGROUND: Single-sided deafness refers to profound sensorineural hearing loss 
or non-functional hearing in one ear, with normal or near-normal hearing in the 
other ear. Its hallmark is the inability to localize sound and hear in noisy 
environments. Conductive hearing loss occurs when there is a mechanical problem 
with the conduction of sound vibrations. Mixed hearing loss is a combination of 
sensorineural and conductive hearing loss. Conductive and mixed hearing loss, 
which frequently affect both ears, create additional challenges in learning, 
employment, and quality of life. Cochlear implants and bone-conduction implants 
may offer objective and subjective benefits of hearing for people with these 
conditions who are deemed inappropriate candidates for standard hearing aids and 
do not meet the current indication (i.e., bilateral deafness) for publicly 
funded cochlear implants in Canada.
METHODS: We conducted a health technology assessment, which included an 
evaluation of clinical benefits and harms, cost-effectiveness, budget impact, 
and patient preferences and values related to implantable devices for 
single-sided deafness and conductive or mixed hearing loss. We performed a 
systematic literature search for systematic reviews and cost-effectiveness 
studies of cochlear implants and bone-conduction implants, compared to no 
interventions, for these conditions in adults and children. We conducted 
cost-utility analyses and budget impact analyses from the perspective of the 
Ontario Ministry of Health to examine the impact of publicly funding both types 
of hearing implants for the defined populations. We also interviewed 22 patients 
and parents of children about their experience with hearing loss and hearing 
implants.
RESULTS: We included 20 publications in the clinical evidence review. For adults 
and children with single-sided deafness, cochlear implantation when compared 
with no treatment improves speech perception in noise (% correct responses: 43% 
vs. 15%, P < .01; GRADE: Moderate), sound localization (localization error: 14° 
vs. 41°, P < .01; GRADE: Moderate), tinnitus (Visual Analog Scale, loudness: 3.5 
vs. 8.5, P < .01; GRADE: Moderate), and hearing-specific quality of life (Speech 
Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale, speech: 5.8 vs. 2.6, P = .01; spatial: 
5.7 vs. 2.3, P < .01; GRADE: Moderate); for children, speech and language 
development also improve (GRADE: Moderate). For those with single-sided deafness 
in whom cochlear implantation is contraindicated, bone-conduction implants when 
compared with no intervention provide clinically important functional gains in 
hearing thresholds (36-41 dB improvement in pure tone audiometry and 38-56 dB 
improvement in speech reception threshold, P < .05; GRADE: Moderate) and improve 
speech perception in noise (signal-to-noise ratio -2.0 vs. 0.6, P < .05 for 
active percutaneous devices; signal-to-noise ratio improved by 1.3-2.5 dB, P < 
.05 for active transcutaneous devices; GRADE: Moderate) and hearing-specific 
quality of life (Abbreviated Profile for Hearing Aid Benefit, ease of 
communication: 12%-53% vs. 24%-59%; background noise: 18%-48% vs. 33%-79%; 
listening in reverberant condition: 26%-55% vs. 41%-65%, P < .05 [active 
percutaneous devices]; ease of communication: 7% vs. 20%; background noise: 46% 
vs. 69%; listening in reverberant condition: 27% vs. 43%; P < .05 [active 
transcutaneous devices]; Children's Home Inventory for Listening Difficulties 
score 7.3 vs. 3.4; P < .05 [passive transcutaneous devices]; GRADE: Moderate). 
For those with conductive or mixed hearing loss, bone-conduction implants when 
compared with no intervention improve hearing thresholds (improved 19-45 dB 
[active percutaneous devices], improved 24-37 dB [active transcutaneous 
devices], improved 31 dB [passive transcutaneous devices], and improved 21-49 dB 
[active transcutaneous middle-ear implants]; GRADE: Moderate), speech perception 
(% correct: 77%-93% vs. < 25%; P < .05 [active transcutaneous devices], % speech 
recognition: 55%-98% vs. 0-72%; P < .05 [active transcutaneous middle-ear 
implants]; GRADE: Moderate), and hearing-specific quality of life and subjective 
benefits of hearing (GRADE: Moderate).In the cost-utility analyses, cochlear 
implants for adults and children with single-sided deafness provided greater 
health gains for an incremental cost, compared with no intervention. On average, 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was between $17,783 and $18,148 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). At a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per 
QALY, 70% of the simulations were considered cost-effective. For the same 
population, bone-conduction implants were not likely to be cost-effective 
compared with no intervention (ICER: $402,899-$408,350/QALY). Only 38% of 
simulations were considered cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 
per QALY. For adults and children with conductive or mixed hearing loss, 
bone-conduction implants may be cost-effective compared with no intervention 
(ICER: $74,155-$87,580/QALY). However, there was considerable uncertainty in the 
results. At a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY, only 50% to 55% of 
simulations were cost-effective. In sensitivity analyses, results were most 
sensitive to changes in health-related utilities (measured using generic 
quality-of-life tools), highlighting the limitations of currently published data 
(i.e., small sample sizes and short follow-up).For people with single-sided 
deafness, publicly funding cochlear implants in Ontario would result in an 
estimated additional cost of $2.8 million to $3.6 million in total over the next 
5 years, and an additional $0.8 million would be required for bone-conduction 
implants for this population. For people with conductive or mixed hearing loss, 
publicly funding bone-conduction implants would cost an estimated additional 
$3.1 million to $3.3 million in total over the next 5 years.In interviews, 
people with single-sided deafness and conductive or mixed hearing loss reported 
that standard hearing aids did not meet their expectations; therefore, they 
chose to undergo surgery for an implantable device. Most participants with 
experience of a cochlear implant or bone-conduction implant spoke positively 
about being able to hear better and enjoy a better quality of life. People with 
a cochlear implant reported additional benefits: binaural hearing, better sound 
localization, and better hearing in noisy areas. Cost and access were barriers 
to receiving an implantable device.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on evidence of moderate quality, cochlear implantation and 
bone-conduction implants improve functional and patient-important outcomes in 
adults and children with single-sided deafness and conductive or mixed hearing 
loss. Qualitative results of interviews with patients are consistent with the 
findings of the systematic reviews we examined.Among people with single-sided 
deafness, cochlear implants may be cost-effective compared with no intervention, 
but bone-conduction implants are unlikely to be. Among people with conductive or 
mixed hearing loss, bone-conduction implants may be cost-effective compared with 
no intervention. Results and uncertainty are mainly driven by changes in health 
utilities associated with having a hearing implant. Hence, further research on 
utility values in this population is warranted with larger sample sizes and 
longer follow-up.The 5-year cost of publicly funding both types of hearing 
implant for single-sided deafness and conductive or mixed hearing loss in 
Ontario is estimated to be $6.7 million to $7.8 million.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Severe, Symptomatic 
Aortic Valve Stenosis at Intermediate Surgical Risk: A Health Technology 
Assessment.

Ontario Health (Quality).

Collaborators: Costa V, Falk L, Tu HA, Yeung MW, Ali A, Walter M.

BACKGROUND: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is the conventional 
treatment in patients at low or intermediate surgical risk. Transcatheter aortic 
valve implantation (TAVI) is a less invasive procedure, originally developed as 
an alternative for patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk.
METHODS: We conducted a health technology assessment of TAVI versus SAVR in 
patients with severe, symptomatic aortic valve stenosis at intermediate surgical 
risk, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, 
budget impact, and patient preferences and values. We performed a literature 
search to retrieve systematic reviews and selected one that was relevant to our 
research question. We complemented the systematic review with a literature 
search to identify randomized controlled trials published after the review. 
Applicable, previously published cost-effectiveness analyses were available, so 
we did not conduct a primary economic evaluation. We analyzed the net budget 
impact of publicly funding TAVI in people at intermediate surgical risk in 
Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of TAVI for people at intermediate 
surgical risk, we spoke with people who had aortic valve stenosis and their 
families.
RESULTS: We identified two randomized controlled trials; they found that in 
patients with severe, symptomatic aortic valve stenosis, TAVI was noninferior to 
SAVR with respect to the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling 
stroke within 2 years of follow-up (GRADE: High). However, compared with SAVR, 
TAVI had a higher risk of some complications and a lower risk of others. 
Device-related costs for TAVI (approximately $23,000) are much higher than for 
SAVR (approximately $6,000). Based on two published cost-effectiveness analyses 
conducted from the perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health, TAVI was more 
expensive and, on average, more effective (i.e., it produced more 
quality-adjusted life-years) than SAVR. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios showed that TAVI may be cost-effective, but the probability of TAVI being 
cost-effective versus SAVR was less than 60% at a willingness-to-pay value of 
$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. The net budget impact of publicly 
funding TAVI in Ontario would be about $2 million to $3 million each year for 
the next 5 years. This cost may be reduced if people receiving TAVI have a 
shorter hospital stay (≤ 3 days). We interviewed 13 people who had lived 
experience with aortic valve stenosis. People who had undergone TAVI reported 
reduced physical and psychological effects and a shorter recovery time. Patients 
and caregivers living in remote or northern regions reported lower out-of-pocket 
costs with TAVI because the length of hospital stay was reduced. People said 
that TAVI increased their quality of life in the short-term immediately after 
the procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: In people with severe, symptomatic aortic valve stenosis at 
intermediate surgical risk, TAVI was similar to SAVR with respect to the 
composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. However, the two 
treatments had different patterns of complications. The study authors also noted 
that longer follow-up is needed to assess the durability of the TAVI valve. 
Compared with SAVR, TAVI may provide good value for money, but publicly funding 
TAVI in Ontario would result in additional costs over the next 5 years. People 
with aortic valve stenosis who had undergone TAVI appreciated its less invasive 
nature and reported a substantial reduction in physical and psychological 
effects after the procedure, improving their quality of life.

Continual Long-Term Physiotherapy After Stroke: A Health Technology Assessment.

Ontario Health (Quality).

Collaborators: Nevis I, Xie X, Li C, Guo J, Shafique A, Walter M.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is a serious health issue in which an interruption in blood 
flow to any part of the brain damages brain cells. About 83% of people survive 
with substantial morbidity after their first stroke. We conducted a health 
technology assessment of continual long-term physiotherapy for people with a 
diagnosis of stroke, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, 
cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding continual long-term 
physiotherapy for people with a diagnosis of stroke, and patient preferences and 
values.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. 
We also performed a systematic literature search of the economic evidence. We 
did not conduct a primary economic evaluation because there was insufficient 
clinical evidence. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding 
continual long-term physiotherapy after stroke in Ontario. To contextualize the 
potential value of continual long-term physiotherapy after stroke, we spoke with 
people who had been diagnosed with stroke, as well as their caregivers.
RESULTS: We did not find any published studies that met the specific clinical 
inclusion criteria. We did not identify any studies that compared the 
cost-effectiveness of continual long-term versus short-term physiotherapy after 
stroke. The budget impact of publicly funding continual long-term physiotherapy 
after stroke in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from $445,000 in year 1 at 
an uptake rate of 8% to $888,000 in year 5 at an uptake rate of 16%. The people 
who had been diagnosed with stroke with whom we spoke reported that they had 
benefitted from continual long-term physiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify studies that addressed the specific research 
question. Based on the clinical evidence review, we are unable to determine the 
benefits of continual long-term compared with short-term physiotherapy after 
stroke. The cost-effectiveness of continual long-term physiotherapy after stroke 
in Ontario is unknown. We estimate that publicly funding continual long-term 
physiotherapy after stroke in Ontario would result in additional costs of 
between $445,000 and $888,000 annually over the next 5 years. Patients and 
caregivers who we spoke with felt that patients who have experienced a stroke 
should be able to continue with physiotherapy.

    Clin Orthop Relat Res. 2020 Apr;478(4):819-821.

BACKGROUND: PATHFx is a clinical decision-support tool based on machine learning 
capable of estimating the likelihood of survival after surgery for patients with 
skeletal metastases. The applicability of any machine-learning tool depends not 
only on successful external validation in unique patient populations but also on 
remaining relevant as more effective systemic treatments are introduced. With 
advancements in the treatment of metastatic disease, it is our responsibility to 
patients to ensure clinical support tools remain contemporary and accurate.
QUESTION/PURPOSES: Therefore, we sought to (1) generate updated PATHFx models 
using recent data from patients treated at one large, urban tertiary referral 
center and (2) externally validate the models using two contemporary patient 
populations treated either surgically or nonsurgically with external-beam 
radiotherapy alone for symptomatic skeletal metastases for symptomatic lesions.
METHODS: After obtaining institutional review board approval, we collected data 
on 208 patients undergoing surgical treatment for pathologic fractures at 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2015 and 2018. These data were 
combined with the original PATHFx training set (n = 189) to create the final 
training set (n = 397). We then created six Bayesian belief networks designed to 
estimate the likelihood of 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 
24-month survival after treatment. Bayesian belief analysis is a statistical 
method that allows data-driven learning to arise from conditional probabilities 
by exploring relationships between variables to estimate the likelihood of an 
outcome using observed data. For external validation, we extracted the records 
of patients treated between 2016 and 2018 from the International Bone Metastasis 
Registry and records of patients treated nonoperatively with external-beam 
radiation therapy for symptomatic skeletal metastases from 2012 to 2016 using 
the Military Health System Data Repository (radiotherapy-only group). From each 
record, we collected the date of treatment, laboratory values at the time of 
treatment initiation, demographic data, details of diagnosis, and the date of 
death. All records reported sufficient follow-up to establish survival (yes/no) 
at 24-months after treatment. For external validation, we applied the data from 
each record to the new PATHFx models. We assessed calibration (calibration 
plots), accuracy (Brier score), discriminatory ability (area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve [AUC]).
RESULTS: The updated PATHFx version 3.0 models successfully classified survival 
at each time interval in both external validation sets and demonstrated 
appropriate discriminatory ability and model calibration. The Bayesian models 
were reasonably calibrated to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
training set. External validation with 197 records from the International Bone 
Metastasis Registry and 192 records from the Military Health System Data 
Repository for analysis found Brier scores that were all less than 0.20, with 
upper bounds of the 95% confidence intervals all less than 0.25, both for the 
radiotherapy-only and International Bone Metastasis Registry groups. 
Additionally, AUC estimates were all greater than 0.70, with lower bounds of the 
95% CI all greater than 0.68, except for the 1-month radiotherapy-only group. To 
complete external validation, decision curve analysis demonstrated clinical 
utility. This means it was better to use the PATHFx models when compared to the 
default assumption that all or no patients would survive at all time periods 
except for the 1-month models. We believe the favorable Brier scores (< 0.20) as 
well as DCA indicate these models are suitable for clinical use.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully updated PATHFx using contemporary data from 
patients undergoing either surgical or nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic 
skeletal metastases. These models have been incorporated for clinical use on 
PATHFx version 3.0 (https://www.pathfx.org). Clinically, external validation 
suggests it is better to use PATHFx version 3.0 for all time periods except when 
deciding whether to give radiotherapy to patients with the life expectancy of 
less than 1 month. This is partly because most patients survived 1-month after 
treatment. With the advancement of medical technology in treatment and diagnosis 
for patients with metastatic bone disease, part of our fiduciary responsibility 
is to the main current clinical support tools.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Over the recent decades, Lithuania has reported very high 
alcohol-related harm and mortality indicators when compared to other countries. 
This, among other reasons, led to an adoption of comprehensive evidence-based 
alcohol control policy measures back in 2007 and 2016. The aim of this study is 
to examine alcohol-related male mortality in the context of changing alcohol 
control policies over the period 2000-2017.
DESIGN AND METHODS: The life table decomposition method was applied to estimate 
to what extent the age groups and causes of death are responsible for changes in 
male life expectancy in the period 2000-2017. Furthermore, a time series 
intervention model was used to study the impact of alcohol control measures on 
alcohol-related mortality. A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average 
model was fitted.
RESULTS: Male life expectancy increased by 6.23 years in the period 2007-2017, 
mainly due to a decrease in mortality from external causes of death 
(2.12 years), cardiovascular diseases (1.84 years) and alcohol-related disorders 
(0.86 years). Reduced male mortality in the 30-64 years age group also 
contributed to a large increase in male life expectancy during the same period.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The greatest positive effect of reduced 
alcohol-related mortality to male life expectancy was observed during the period 
2007-2009. It overlaps with the start of implementation of the comprehensive 
alcohol control measures. However, further research on the impact of different 
alcohol policy interventions on various outcomes is needed.

The extracellular matrix provides cells with a support structure and an 
attachment site in actual substrate. Its biochemical and surface properties play 
an important role in and have significant impact on cell attachment, 
proliferation, migration, differentiation, and gene expression. Leveraging the 
hydrophilicity and neuroprotective of gastrodin, a gastrodin/polyurethane (PU) 
elastomer was developed utilizing in situ polymerization and salt-leaching 
methods. The results showed that gastrodin/PU film had a good flexibility and 
supporting strength, as well as hydrophilicity. Thus film possessed highly 
surface area, interconnected porous structure with a pore size (10~60 μm) for 
cell attachment, and could provide surface cues to augment neurite extension. 
For PC12 cells cultured within the films, especially the 5gastrodin/PU group, 
presented a progressive increase with time, coupled with the upregulation of 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor 
expression. This is the first report on the construction of a gastrodin/PU 
porous film, and the results reveal its promise as a scaffold material for 
neural tissue engineering.

Exosomes, as natural occurring vesicles, play highly important roles in the 
behavior and fate of ischemic diseases and different tumors. Secretion, 
composition, and function of exosomes are remarkably influenced by hypoxia in 
ischemic diseases and tumor microenvironment. Exosomes secreted from hypoxic 
cells affect development, growth, angiogenesis, and progression in ischemic 
diseases and tumors through a variety of signaling pathways. In this review 
article, we discuss how hypoxia affects the quantity and quality of exosomes, 
and review the mechanisms by which hypoxic cell-derived exosomes regulate 
ischemic cell behaviors in both cancerous and noncancerous cells.

BACKGROUND: Frailty in elderly patients is associated with an increased risk of 
poor health outcomes, including falls, delirium, malnutrition, hospitalisation, 
and mortality. Because polypharmacy is recognised as a possible major 
contributor to the pathogenesis of geriatric frailty, reducing inappropriate 
medication exposure is supposed to be a promising approach to improve 
health-related quality of life and prevent adverse outcomes. A major challenge 
for the process of deprescribing of inappropriate polypharmacy is to improve the 
communication between general practitioner (GPs), patient and family carer. This 
study investigates the effects of a complex intervention in frail elderly 
patients with polypharmacy living at home.
METHODS: This is a cluster randomised controlled trial including 136 GPs and 676 
patients. Patients with a positive clinical screening for frailty are eligible 
if they are aged 70 years or older, receiving family or professional nursing 
care at home, and taking in five or more drugs per day. Exclusion criteria are 
higher grade of dementia and life expectancy of 6 months or less. The GPs of the 
intervention group receive an educational training promoting a deprescribing 
guideline and providing information on how to conduct a family conference 
focussing on prioritisation of treatment goals concerning drug therapy. During 
the 1-year intervention, GPs are expected to perform a total of three family 
conferences, each including a structured medication review with patients and 
their family carers. GPs of the control group will receive no training and will 
deliver care as usual. Geriatric assessment of all patients will be performed by 
study nurses during home visits at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. The 
primary outcome is the hospitalisation rate during the observation period of 
12 months. Secondary outcomes are number and appropriateness of medications, 
mobility, weakness, cognition, depressive disorder, health-related quality of 
life, activities of daily living, weight, and costs of health care use.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence for a pragmatic co-operative and 
patient-centred educational intervention using family conferences to improve 
patient safety in frail elderly patients with polypharmacy.
