CONTEXT: People living in rural areas have poorer health than their urban 
counterparts with higher morbidity and mortality rates and lower life 
expectancy. Challenges attracting health professionals to work in rural 
locations in Australia and elsewhere have been well- documented. In response, 
the idea of a rural pipeline emerged in the medical literature as a career 
pathway for doctors, conceptualised as a career continuum starting at school and 
ending in a committed, appropriately trained and supported rural doctor. This 
article draws on the literature to consider how the concept of a rural pipeline 
can be used to enhance recruitment and retention of allied health professionals 
(AHPs) in Australia. The complexity of the issue is taken into account, 
acknowledging the diverse professional, organisational and social needs within 
and between AHPs and their different career pathways. With this in mind, the 
rural pipeline is adapted and extended to focus on AHPs who enter at any stage 
of their career to work in rural areas.
ISSUES: Barriers to recruitment and retention require multifaceted strategies to 
encourage and support AHPs at various stages along the pipeline to enter, and 
remain in, rural practice. Findings from the literature identify discrete themes 
within and between AHPs about factors influencing their rural recruitment and 
retention choices and include career stage at entry to rural practice, age, 
gender, social context, professional support, organisational environment and 
public-private practice mix in service delivery. These findings underscored the 
development of an extended rural pipeline adapted to specifically target AHPs. 
This flexible framework of entry to rural practice can be applied at any stage 
of their career and includes suggestions of strategies to support retention.
LESSONS LEARNED: Evidence from studies of rural AHPs suggests a flexible 
approach to recruitment and retention is needed that takes into account the 
complexity of the issue. The extended rural pipeline adapted to AHPs avoids a 
one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, it offers a more nuanced approach that 
addresses the diversity within and between professions and reflects the 
different stages at which AHPs enter rural practice that can inform recruitment 
and retention strategies that better meet their needs.

Mosquitoes are blood-feeding insects serving as the most important vectors for 
spreading human pathogens and parasites. Dengue is a viral disease mainly 
vectored through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes. Its transmission has recently 
increased in urban and semi-urban areas of tropical and subtropical regions 
worldwide, becoming a major international public health concern. There is no 
specific treatment for dengue. Its prevention and control solely depend on 
effective vector control measures. Mangrove plants have been used in Indian 
traditional medicine for a wide array of purposes. In this research, we proposed 
a method for biosynthesis of antiviral and mosquitocidal silver nanoparticles 
(AgNP) using the aqueous extract of Bruguiera cylindrica leaves. AgNP were 
characterized using a variety of biophysical analyses, including UV-visible 
spectrophotometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron 
microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Bruguiera cilyndrica 
aqueous extract and green-synthesized AgNP were tested against the primary 
dengue vector Aedes aegypti. AgNP were the most effective. LC50 values ranged 
from 8.93 ppm (larva I) to 30.69 ppm (pupa). In vitro experiments showed that 
30 μg/ml of AgNP significantly inhibited the production of dengue viral envelope 
(E) protein in vero cells and downregulated the expression of dengue viral E 
gene. Concerning nontarget effects, we observed that the predation efficiency of 
Carassius auratus against A. aegypti was not affected by exposure at sublethal 
doses of AgNP. Predation in the control was 71.81 % (larva II) and 50.43 % 
(larva III), while in an AgNP-treated environment, predation was boosted to 
90.25 and 76.81 %, respectively. Overall, this study highlights the concrete 
potential of green-synthesized AgNP in the fight against dengue virus. 
Furthermore, B. cylindrica-synthesized AgNP can be employed at low doses to 
reduce larval and pupal population of A. aegypti, without detrimental effects of 
predation rates of mosquito predators, such as C. auratus.

In many species, population dynamics are shaped by age-structured demographic 
parameters, such as survival, which can cause age-specific sensitivity to 
environmental conditions. Accordingly, we can expect populations with different 
age-specific survival to be differently affected by environmental variation. 
However, this hypothesis is rarely tested at the intra-specific level. Using 
capture-mark-recapture models, we quantified age-specific survival and the 
extent of annual variations in survival of females of alpine chamois in two 
sites. In one population, survival was very high (>0.94; Bauges, France) until 
the onset of senescence at approximately 7 years old, whereas the two other 
populations (Swiss National Park, SNP) had a later onset (12 years old) and a 
lower rate of senescence. Senescence patterns are therefore not fixed within 
species. Annual variation in survival was higher in the Bauges (SD = 0.26) 
compared to the SNP populations (SD = 0.20). Also, in each population, the age 
classes with the lowest survival also experienced the largest temporal 
variation, in accordance with inter-specific comparisons showing a greater 
impact of environmental variation on these age classes. The large difference 
between the populations in age-specific survival and variation suggests that 
environmental variation and climate change will affect these populations 
differently.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) and posterior sacral 
rhizotomy restores the ability to urinate on demand with low residual volumes, 
which is a key for preventing urinary complications that account for 10% of the 
causes of death in patients with spinal cord injury with a neurogenic bladder. 
Nevertheless, comparative cost-effectiveness results on a long time horizon are 
lacking to adequately inform decisions of reimbursement.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to estimate the long-term cost-utility of SARS using 
the Finetech-Brindley device compared with medical treatment 
(anticholinergics+catheterization).
STUDY DESIGN/SETTINGS: The following study design is used for the paper: Markov 
model elaborated with a 10-year time horizon; with four irreversible states: (1) 
initial treatment, (2) year 1 of surgery for urinary complication, (3) year >1 
of surgery for urinary complication, and (4) death; and reversible states: 
urinary calculi; Finetech-Brindley device failures.
PATIENT SAMPLE: The sample consisted of theoretical cohorts of patients with a 
complete spinal cord lesion since ≥1 year, and a neurogenic bladder.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness was expressed as quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs). Costs were valued in EUR 2013 in the perspective of the French health 
system.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analyses were performed to estimate 
transition probabilities and QALYs. Costs were estimated from the literature, 
and through simulations using the 2013 French prospective payment system 
classification. Probabilistic analyses were conducted to handle parameter 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis (2.5% discount rate), the cost-utility ratio 
was 12,710 EUR per QALY gained. At a threshold of 30,000 EUR per QALY the 
probability of SARS being cost-effective compared with medical treatment was 
60%. If the French Healthcare System reimbursed SARS for 80 patients per year 
during 10 years (anticipated target population), the expected incremental net 
health benefit would be 174 QALYs, and the expected value of perfect information 
(EVPI) would be 4.735 million EUR. The highest partial EVPI is reached for 
utility values and costs (1.3-1.6 million EUR).
CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that SARS using Finetech-Brindley device offers the 
most important benefit and should be considered cost-effective at a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of 30,000 EUR per QALY. Despite a high uncertainty, 
EVPI and partial EVPI may indicate that further research would not be profitable 
to inform decision-making.

Interleukin-6 (IL6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is required for 
resistance against many pathogens. However, sustained IL6 activity can cause 
tissue damage in the periphery and brain. Previous studies have shown that 
populations in disease-endemic regions adapt by selecting the high-producing 
G-allele at the -174G>C (rs1800795) polymorphism, while others have linked 
increased IL6 to cognitive impairments. The present study sought to determine 
whether up-regulation of IL6 by the G-allele at rs1800795 polymorphism in 
disease-endemic regions was associated with increased cognitive deficits and 
corollary reductions in social, economic, and political development. We tested 
these hypotheses in a global sample of 189 nations with World Health 
Organization ratings for infectious diseases. We also included the Historical 
Pathogen Prevalence index, a measure of national average intelligence (IQ), and 
the United Nation Human Development Index (HDI) including per capita income, 
life expectancy, child mortality, and fertility rate. IL6 -174G>C allele 
frequencies were obtained from 171,168 individuals spanning 84 nations. The 
high-producing G-allele frequency was positively correlated with infectious 
disease ranking (r=0.745, P<0.001) and negatively with IQ (r=-0.524, P<0.001) 
and HDI (r=-0.671, P<0.001). These robust findings suggest that in regions with 
a high pathogen burden the need for a strong IL6 response is accompanied by 
cognitive deficits and reduced HDI ranking.

BACKGROUND: X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (X-HIGM) due to mutations in the gene 
encoding CD40 ligand results in failure of Ig class switching and an increased 
propensity for recurrent sinopulmonary and other infections, and thus decreased 
life expectancy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is 
curative, but long-term follow-up data are limited.
PROCEDURES: We conducted a retrospective analysis of seven patients who have 
undergone allogeneic HSCT for HIGM syndrome at Duke University Medical Center.
RESULTS: Median age at transplant was 5.2 years (range 0.7-19.3). None of the 
patients had active hepatic or pulmonary disease immediately prior to 
transplant, but all had a history of serious infections. Five patients received 
myeloablative conditioning, and two patients received reduced intensity 
conditioning. Graft sources included bone marrow, peripheral blood, and 
unrelated umbilical cord blood. Post-transplantation complications included 
veno-occlusive disease, hemorrhagic cystitis, adenoviremia, and cryptosporidium 
recurrence in one patient each. Two patients developed acute GVHD grades II-IV 
that resolved promptly with treatment and none developed extensive chronic GVHD. 
All patients are intravenous IgG-independent and 6/7 have normal antibody 
titers. Immunoglobulin (Ig) A levels normalized in all but one patient and T and 
B cell numbers and function are otherwise normal in all. All patients are alive 
at a median follow-up of 9.7 (range 9.7-16.1) years post-transplantation with 
predominantly donor chimerism and no recurrent infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic HSCT results in excellent survival and sustained immune 
reconstitution in patients with CD40 ligand deficiency using both myeloablative 
and reduced intensity conditioning approaches and various graft sources, 
including bone marrow, peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood.

BACKGROUND: Group cognitive stimulation therapy programmes can benefit cognition 
and quality of life for people with dementia. Evidence for home-based, carer-led 
cognitive stimulation interventions is limited.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
carer-delivered individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) for people with 
dementia and their family carers, compared with treatment as usual (TAU).
DESIGN: A multicentre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial assessing 
clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Assessments were at baseline, 13 
weeks and 26 weeks (primary end point).
SETTING: Participants were recruited through Memory Clinics and Community Mental 
Health Teams for older people.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 356 caregiving dyads were recruited and 273 completed 
the trial.
INTERVENTION: iCST consisted of structured cognitive stimulation sessions for 
people with dementia, completed up to three times weekly over 25 weeks. Family 
carers were supported to deliver the sessions at home.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes for the person with dementia were 
cognition and quality of life. Secondary outcomes included behavioural and 
psychological symptoms, activities of daily living, depressive symptoms and 
relationship quality. The primary outcome for the family carers was 
mental/physical health (Short Form questionnaire-12 items). Health-related 
quality of life (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions), mood symptoms, 
resilience and relationship quality comprised the secondary outcomes. Costs were 
estimated from health and social care and societal perspectives.
RESULTS: There were no differences in any of the primary outcomes for people 
with dementia between intervention and TAU [cognition: mean difference -0.55, 
95% confidence interval (CI) -2.00 to 0.90; p-value = 0.45; self-reported 
quality of life: mean difference -0.02, 95% CI -1.22 to 0.82; p-value = 0.97 at 
the 6-month follow-up]. iCST did not improve mental/physical health for carers. 
People with dementia in the iCST group experienced better relationship quality 
with their carer, but there was no evidence that iCST improved their activities 
of daily living, depression or behavioural and psychological symptoms. iCST 
seemed to improve health-related quality of life for carers but did not benefit 
carers' resilience or their relationship quality with their relative. Carers 
conducting more sessions had fewer depressive symptoms. Qualitative data 
suggested that people with dementia and their carers experienced better 
communication owing to iCST. Adjusted mean costs were not significantly 
different between the groups. From the societal perspective, both health gains 
and cost savings were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: iCST did not improve cognition or quality of life for people with 
dementia, or carers' physical and mental health. Costs of the intervention were 
offset by some reductions in social care and other services. Although there was 
some evidence of improvement in terms of the caregiving relationship and carers' 
health-related quality of life, iCST does not appear to deliver clinical 
benefits for cognition and quality of life for people with dementia. Most people 
received fewer than the recommended number of iCST sessions. Further research is 
needed to ascertain the clinical effectiveness of carer-led cognitive 
stimulation interventions for people with dementia.

An increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been observed in a range 
of chronic inflammatory diseases (CID), including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE). The increased risk of CVDs and reduced life expectancy in these 
conditions has stimulated considerable research and started an ongoing 
discussion on the need for a multidisciplinary approach and dedicated guidelines 
on CVD prevention in these patients. In addition, the possibility of inhibiting 
inflammation as a means to preventing CVD in these patients has gained 
considerable interest in recent years. We briefly summarize the current level of 
evidence of the association between CIDs and CVD and cardiovascular risk 
management recommendations. Perspectives of ongoing and planned trials are 
discussed in consideration of potential ways to improve primary and secondary 
CVD prevention in patients with CID.

Modern treatment in Parkinson's disease, a personal approach.

There are many guidelines available concerning the treatment of Parkinson's 
disease. Most of these advocate treating young-onset patients with a dopamine 
agonist and older patients with levodopa. The rationale behind this 
recommendation has its origins in the side effects associated with each of these 
drug classes: whilst levodopa leads to dyskinesia, which may not be relevant for 
patients with a limited life-expectancy, dopamine agonists have a much longer 
plasma half life which probably leads to more continuous dopamine receptor 
stimulation and thus decreases the occurrence and severity of dyskinesia. 
However, the side effects associated with the use of dopamine agonists, such as 
sleepiness, orthostatic problems, hallucinations and impulse control disorders 
are a drawback. In this overview, the hypothesis will be put forward that 
perhaps such a strict distinction is no longer needed. A new idea may be the 
early combination of levodopa with a dopamine agonist which would provide good 
clinical efficacy and, because of the relatively low doses involved, would 
reduce the side effects associated with both substances. MAO-B inhibitors may be 
a good option for early treatment and especially for patients who experience 
first motor fluctuations. Similarly, and particularly if a wearing-off symptom 
is present, COMT inhibitors smoothen and prolong the action of levodopa. More 
invasive escalation therapy comes into play when patients reach the advanced 
stages with problems of insufficient motor control, such as bradykinesia, 
rigidity and resting tremor, combined with on-time dyskinesia. The use of all 
oral and invasive treatment has to be individualized to gain a good motor and 
non-motor control and especially a good quality of life.

Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF), a chronic progressive disease 
affecting mucus viscosity, has been beneficial in both improving life expectancy 
and the quality of life for individuals with CF. In New York State from 2007 to 
2012 screening for CF involved measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels 
in dried blood spots from newborns using the IMMUCHEM(™) Blood Spot Trypsin-MW 
ELISA kit. Any specimen in the top 5% IRT level underwent DNA analysis using the 
InPlex(®) CF Molecular Test. Of the 1.48 million newborns screened during the 
6-year time period, 7631 babies were referred for follow-up. CF was confirmed in 
251 cases, and 94 cases were diagnosed with CF transmembrane conductance 
regulated-related metabolic syndrome or possible CF. Nine reports of false 
negatives were made to the program. Variation in daily average IRT was observed 
depending on the season (4-6 ng/ml) and kit lot (<3 ng/ml), supporting the use 
of a floating cutoff. The screening method had a sensitivity of 96.5%, 
specificity of 99.6%, positive predictive value of 4.5%, and negative predictive 
value of 99.5%.
CONCLUSION: Considerations for CF screening algorithms should include IRT 
variations resulting from age at specimen collection, sex, race/ethnicity, 
season, and manufacturer kit lots.
WHAT IS KNOWN: Measuring IRT level in dried blood spots is the first-tier screen 
for CF. Current algorithms for CF screening lead to substantial false-positive 
referral rates.
WHAT IS NEW: IRT values were affected by age of infant when specimen is 
collected, race/ethnicity and sex of infant, and changes in seasons and 
manufacturer kit lots The prevalence of CF in NYS is 1 in 4200 with the highest 
prevalence in White infants (1 in 2600) and the lowest in Black infants (1 in 
15,400).

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are oligoclonal hematopoietic disorders 
characterized by peripheral cytopenias with anemias being the most prevalent 
feature. The majority of patients will depend on regular transfusions of packed 
red blood cells (PRBC) during the course of the disease. Particularly patients 
with MDS and low risk for transformation into acute myeloid leukemia and low 
risk of early death will receive PRBC transfusions on a regular basis, which 
puts them at high risk for transfusional iron overload. Transfusion dependence 
has been associated with negative impact on organ function and reduced life 
expectancy. Recently, several retrospective but also some prospective studies 
have indicated, that transfusion dependent patients with MDS might benefit from 
consequent iron chelation with regard to morbidity and mortality. However, low 
treatment adherence due to adverse events mainly gastrointestinal in nature is 
an important obstacle in achieving sufficient iron chelation in MDS patients. 
Here, we will summarize and discuss the existing data on Deferasirox in low risk 
MDS published so far and provide recommendations for optimal management of 
gastrointestinal adverse events during iron chelation aiming at improving 
treatment compliance and, hence, sufficiently removing excess iron from the 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts health, quality of life and 
workplace productivity. Antidepressant treatment is the primary therapeutic 
intervention. This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of new 
generation antidepressants and their cost-effectiveness in the Singapore 
healthcare system.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for head-to-head randomised controlled 
trials on ten antidepressants (agomelatine, duloxetine, escitalopram, 
fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone and 
venlafaxine) employed as monotherapy in acute MDD management. We performed a 
network meta-analysis to compare their relative efficacy. The outcome measures 
for efficacy were response and remission rate, and mean change in Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score; and for tolerability, study withdrawal 
rates due to adverse events. To evaluate their relative cost effectiveness, a 
decision tree simulating a cohort of MDD patients using antidepressant as 
monotherapy was constructed from a societal perspective over 6 months. We used 
effectiveness data from our network meta-analysis and local data on resource use 
for depression in Singapore. The incremental cost expected for each additional 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated and presented as the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: We identified 76 relevant articles for the network meta-analysis. Of 
the ten agents included in the analysis, mirtazapine and agomelatine were most 
efficacious in achieving response and remission, respectively. Mirtazapine and 
duloxetine resulted in the greatest magnitude of change in the HDRS score. 
Agomelatine, escitalopram and sertraline were the best tolerated of the drugs 
analysed, while duloxetine was the least well tolerated drug. Using a composite 
outcome of efficacy (response and remission rates) and tolerability, 
agomelatine, escitalopram and mirtazapine were the favoured treatments. In the 
cost-effectiveness analysis, apart from agomelatine, all the treatments were 
dominated by mirtazapine. Against mirtazapine, agomelatine was not cost 
effective given that its ICER exceeded the threshold value.
CONCLUSION: Agomelatine, escitalopram and mirtazapine had favourable balance 
between efficacy and tolerability. In addition, mirtazapine was a cost-effective 
option in the Singapore healthcare system.

BACKGROUND: The Pilates method has been recommended to patients with low back 
pain, but the evidence on effectiveness is inconclusive. In addition, there is 
still no evidence for the cost-effectiveness of this method or for the ideal 
number of sessions to achieve the highest effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study will be to investigate the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of the Pilates method with different weekly frequencies in 
the treatment of patients with nonspecific low back pain.
DESIGN: This is a randomized controlled trial with blinded assessor.
SETTING: This study will be conducted at a physical therapy clinic in São Paulo, 
Brazil.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred ninety-six patients with nonspecific low back pain 
between the ages of 18 and 80 years will be assessed and randomly allocated to 4 
groups (n=74 patients per group).
INTERVENTION: All groups will receive an educational booklet. The booklet group 
will not receive additional exercises. Pilates group 1 will follow a 
Pilates-based program once a week, Pilates group 2 will follow the same program 
twice a week, and Pilates group 3 will follow the same program 3 times a week. 
The intervention will last 6 weeks.
MEASUREMENTS: A blinded assessor will evaluate pain, quality-adjusted 
life-years, general and specific disability, kinesiophobia, pain 
catastrophizing, and global perceived effect 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months 
after randomization.
LIMITATIONS: Therapists and patients will not be blinded.
CONCLUSIONS: This will be the first study to investigate different weekly 
frequencies of treatment sessions for nonspecific low back pain. The results of 
this study will contribute to a better definition of treatment programs for this 
population.

Application of Dorothea Orem's Theory of Self-Care to the Elderly Patient on 
Peritoneal Dialysis.

O'Shaughnessy M.

Due to improvements in health care and increasing life expectancy, a greater 
number of elderly patients need renal replacement therapy. Dorothea Orem's 
Theory of Self-Care is an appropriate model to guide healthcare providers 
addressing the unique capabilities of this generation. The utilization and 
promotion of peritoneal dialysis as a therapy option offers the elderly an 
improved quality of life with a greater sense of self-worth. Literature has 
shown the elderly have superior technique and similar peritonitis-free survival 
rates as the younger population.

Neurodegenerative diseases are relentlessly progressive, severely impacting 
affected patients, families and society as a whole. Increased life expectancy 
has made these diseases more common worldwide. Unfortunately, available drugs 
have insufficient therapeutic effects on many subtypes of these intractable 
diseases, and adverse effects hamper continued treatment. Wasp and bee venoms 
and their components are potential means of managing or reducing these effects 
and provide new alternatives for the control of neurodegenerative diseases. 
These venoms and their components are well-known and irrefutable sources of 
neuroprotectors or neuromodulators. In this respect, the present study reviews 
our current understanding of the mechanisms of action and future prospects 
regarding the use of new drugs derived from wasp and bee venom in the treatment 
of major neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's 
Disease, Epilepsy, Multiple Sclerosis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

OBJECTIVES: To test the feasibility of using an electronic medical record 
(EMR)-based decision support system (DSS) that incorporates morbidity and 
frailty information to individualize colorectal cancer (CRC) screening 
recommendations.
STUDY DESIGN: Our framework used the payoff time, defined as the minimum time 
until the benefits of screening exceed the harms.
METHODS: Subjects were 24 patients eligible for CRC screening and 22 primary 
care providers (PCPs). Measures included PCP satisfaction with existing reminder 
systems and with decision support.
RESULTS: The run-in phase, during which the intervention was inactive but its 
performance was verified, had 14 patients enrolled. The intervention phase, 
during which payoff time and life expectancy calculations were used to recommend 
for or against CRC screening, had 10 patients enrolled. Of the 10 patients 
enrolled in the intervention phase, the DSS recommended in favor of CRC 
screening for 6 patients. (The PCPs also recommended it for those 6 patients, 
although 3 refused the screening.) The DSS recommended against CRC screening for 
4 patients, while the PCPs recommended against it for 3 of those 4 and ordered 
the screening for 1 patient. PCPs who had patients enrolled in the intervention 
phase indicated interest in having payoff time information for all patients 
eligible for CRC screening. This pilot study was small and was not powered to 
determine the effect of the intervention on screening behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer screening involves balancing immediate harms with 
longer-term benefits; EMR decision support may facilitate personalized 
benefit/harm assessment. The payoff time framework is feasible for 
implementation in EMR decision support.

BACKGROUND: Acute bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalisation in 
infancy. Supportive care and oxygen are the cornerstones of management. A 
Cochrane review concluded that the use of nebulised 3% hypertonic saline (HS) 
may significantly reduce the duration of hospitalisation.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that HS reduces the time to when infants were 
assessed as being fit for discharge, defined as in air with saturations of > 92% 
for 6 hours, by 25%.
DESIGN: Parallel-group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial, cost-utility 
analysis and systematic review.
SETTING: Ten UK hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Infants with acute bronchiolitis requiring oxygen therapy were 
allocated within 4 hours of admission.
INTERVENTIONS: Supportive care with oxygen as required, minimal handling and 
fluid administration as appropriate to the severity of the disease, 3% nebulised 
HS every ± 6 hours.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The trial primary outcome was time until the infant met 
objective discharge criteria. Secondary end points included time to discharge 
and adverse events. The costs analysed related to length of stay (LoS), 
readmissions, nebulised saline and other NHS resource use. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were estimated using an existing utility decrement derived 
for hospitalisation in children, together with the time spent in hospital in the 
trial.
DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials and other databases from inception or from 2010 onwards, 
searched ClinicalTrials.gov and other registries and hand-searched Chest, 
Paediatrics and Journal of Paediatrics to January 2015.
REVIEW METHODS: We included randomised/quasi-randomised trials which compared HS 
versus saline (± adjunct treatment) or no treatment. We used a fixed-effects 
model to combine mean differences for LoS and assessed statistical heterogeneity 
using the I (2) statistic.
RESULTS: The trial randomised 158 infants to HS (n = 141 analysed) and 159 to 
standard care (n = 149 analysed). There was no difference between the two arms 
in the time to being declared fit for discharge [median 76.6 vs. 75.9 hours, 
hazard ratio (HR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.20] or to actual 
discharge (median 88.5 vs. 88.7 hours, HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.23). There was 
no difference in adverse events. One infant developed bradycardia with 
desaturation associated with HS. Mean hospital costs were £2595 and £2727 for 
the control and intervention groups, respectively (p = 0.657). Incremental QALYs 
were 0.0000175 (p = 0.757). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £7.6M per 
QALY gained was not appreciably altered by sensitivity analyses. The systematic 
review comprised 15 trials (n = 1922) including our own. HS reduced the mean LoS 
by -0.36 days (95% CI -0.50 to -0.22 days). High levels of heterogeneity (I 
(2) = 78%) indicate that the result should be treated cautiously.
CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, HS had no clinical benefit on LoS or readiness for 
discharge and was not a cost-effective treatment for acute bronchiolitis. Claims 
that HS achieves small reductions in LoS must be treated with scepticism.
FUTURE WORK: Well-powered randomised controlled trials of high-flow oxygen are 
needed.

BACKGROUND: Health and life expectancy for people with hemophilia have improved 
significantly in recent years, but we face new challenges, especially in the 
context of resource-constrained health services.
AIM: This paper aims to highlight such challenges and propose practical 
solutions.
METHODS: Nine hemophilia specialists from Australia and New Zealand reached 
consensus on areas of greatest need for improvement in hemophilia care in these 
countries, based on clinical experience and published data, and agreed on how to 
address these.
RESULTS: Demography, optimizing treatment and assessing treatment success were 
identified as broad areas of challenge which included: comorbidities in ageing 
patients; transitioning from pediatric to adult care; equity of care for remote
