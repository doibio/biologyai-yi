OBJECTIVES: Mechanisms of occurrence and expression of antibiotic resistance 
genes (ARGs) in thermophilic bacteria are still unknown owing to limited 
research and data. In this research, comparative profiling of ARGs and metal 
tolerance genes among thermophilic bacteria has been done by functional 
metagenomic methods.
METHODS: Shotgun metagenomic sequence data were generated using Illumina HiSeq 
4000. Putative ARGs from the PROKKA predicted genes were identified with the 
ardbAnno V.1.0 script available from the ARDB (Antibiotic Resistance Genes 
Database) consortium using the non-redundant resistance genes as a reference. 
Putative metal resistance genes (MRGs) were identified by using BacMetScan 
V.1.0. The whole-genome sequencing for bacterial isolates was performed using 
Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing technology with a paired-end sequencing module.
RESULTS: Metagenomic analysis showed the dominance of Proteobacteria, 
Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes in two hot springs of Sikkim. ARG 
analysis through shotgun gene sequencing was found to be negative in the case of 
thermophilic bacteria. However, few genes were detected but they showed maximum 
similarity with mesophilic bacteria. Concurrently, MRGs were also detected in 
the metagenome sequence of isolates from hot springs. Detection of MRGs and 
absence of ARGs investigated by whole-genome sequencing in the reference genome 
sequence of thermophilic Geobacillus also conveyed the same message.
CONCLUSION: The study of ARGs and MRGs (Heavy metal resistance gene) among 
culturable and non-culturable bacteria from the hot springs of Sikkim via 
metagenomics showed a preferential selection of MRGs over ARGs. The absence of 
ARGs also does not support the co-selection of ARGs and MRGs in these 
environments. This evolutionary selection of metal resistance over antibiotic 
genes may have been necessary to survive in the geological craters which have an 
abundance of different metals from earth sediments rather than antibiotics. 
Furthermore, the selection could be environment driven depending on the 
susceptibility of ARGs in a thermophilic environments as it reduces the chances 
of horizontal gene transfer.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has reported the effects of long-term fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution on years of life lost (YLL), but these 
effects may not represent the full impact. This study aims to estimate potential 
benefits in life time from adhering to daily ambient PM2.5 concentration 
standards/guidelines.
METHODS: This study evaluated the relationship between daily ambient PM2.5 level 
and YLL using a two-stage approach with generalized additive models and 
meta-analysis. Potential life expectancy gains were then estimated by presuming 
that daily PM2.5 levels were in compliance with the Chinese and WHO standards. 
In addition, the attributable fraction of YLL due to excess PM2.5 exposure was 
also calculated.
RESULTS: During 2013-2016, 459,468 non-accidental deaths were recorded in the 
six cities of Pearl River Delta, China. Each 10 μg/m3 increment in four-day 
average (lag03) level of PM2.5 was related to an increment of 13.31 [95% 
confidence interval (CI): 5.74, 20.87] years of life lost. Implementation of the 
WHO guidelines might avoid 180,980.83 YLLs (95% CI: 78,116.07, 283,845.60), 
which corresponded to 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.62) years of increased life time per 
death. Additionally, an estimated 0.15% (95% CI: 0.06%, 0.23%) or 2.04% (95% CI: 
0.88%, 3.20%) of YLLs could be attributed to PM2.5 exposures higher than the 
Chinese or WHO guidelines, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that people might live longer by controlling 
daily PM2.5 concentration and highlights the need to adopt stricter standards in 
China.

The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a clinically validated 
target for cancer therapy, and targeted therapies are often used in regimens for 
patients with a high HER2 expression level. Despite the success of current 
drugs, a number of patients succumb to their disease, which motivates 
development of novel drugs with other modes of action. We have previously shown 
that an albumin binding domain-derived affinity protein with specific affinity 
for HER2, ADAPT6, can be used to deliver the highly cytotoxic protein domain 
PE25, a derivative of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, to HER2 overexpressing malignant 
cells, leading to potent and specific cell killing. In this study we expanded 
the investigation for an optimal targeting domain and constructed two fusion 
toxins where a HER2-binding affibody molecule, ZHER2:2891, or the 
dual-HER2-binding hybrid ZHER2:2891-ADAPT6 were used for cancer cell targeting. 
We found that both targeting domains conferred strong binding to HER2; both to 
the purified extracellular domain and to the HER2 overexpressing cell line 
SKOV3. This resulted in fusion toxins with high cytotoxic potency toward cell 
lines with high expression levels of HER2, with EC50 values between 10 and 100 
pM. For extension of the plasma half-life, an albumin binding domain was also 
included. Intravenous injection of the fusion toxins into mice showed a profound 
influence of the targeting domain on biodistribution. Compared to previous 
results, with ADAPT6 as targeting domain, ZHER2:2891 gave rise to further 
extension of the plasma half-life and also shifted the clearance route of the 
fusion toxin from the liver to the kidneys. Collectively, the results show that 
the targeting domain has a major impact on uptake of PE25-based fusion toxins in 
different organs. The results also show that PE25-based fusion toxins with high 
affinity to HER2 do not necessarily increase the cytotoxicity beyond a certain 
point in affinity. In conclusion, ZHER2:2891 has the most favorable 
characteristics as targeting domain for PE25.

Local Translation in Growth Cones and Presynapses, Two Axonal Compartments for 
Local Neuronal Functions.

During neural development, growth cones, very motile compartments of tips of 
axons, lead axonal extension to the correct targets. Subsequently, presynapses, 
another axonal compartment with vigorous trafficking of synaptic vesicles, 
emerge to form functional synapses with postsynapses. In response to 
extracellular stimuli, the immediate supply of proteins by local translation 
within these two axonal compartments far from cell bodies confers high motility 
of growth cones and active vesicle trafficking in presynapses. Although local 
translation in growth cones and presynapses occurs at a very low level compared 
with cell bodies and even dendrites, recent progress in omics and visualization 
techniques with subcellular fractionation of these compartments has revealed the 
actual situation of local translation within these two axonal compartments. 
Here, the increasing evidence for local protein synthesis in growth cones and 
presynapses for axonal and synaptic functions has been reviewed. Furthermore, 
the mechanisms regulating local translation in these two compartments and 
pathophysiological conditions caused by dysregulated local translation are 
highlighted.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to make a quantitative assessment of the management 
of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in Japanese healthcare settings.
METHODS: We analysed participants' healthcare-seeking behaviour and physicians' 
practice in January 2019 using an online survey of 200 households in Japan. 
Quality of life score, quality-adjusted life years lost, the duration of 
symptoms, and the duration of absence from work were compared between the 
influenza ILI group and the non-influenza ILI group with one-to-one propensity 
score matching. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation.
RESULTS: In total, 261 of the 600 (43.5%) participants had at least one episode 
of influenza-like illness during January 2019. Of these, 194 (75.5%) visited 
healthcare facilities, 167 (86.1%) within 2 days of onset of symptoms. A total 
of 169 out of 191 (88.5%) received a rapid influenza diagnostic test and 101 
were diagnosed with influenza, of whom 95.0% were treated with antivirals. The 
median quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost was 0.0055 (interquartile range, 
IQR 0.0040-0.0072) and median absence from work for a single episode of 
influenza-like illness was 2 days (IQR 1-5 days). Albeit QALYs lost per episode 
was not different between two groups, the influenza ILI group showed longer 
duration of absence from work (5 days, IQR 4-6 days) than the non-influenza ILI 
group (2 days, IQR 1-3 days).
CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, most people with influenza-like illnesses visit 
healthcare facilities soon after symptoms first occur and receive a diagnostic 
test. Those with influenza are usually treated with antivirals. Absence from 
work was longer for influenza than other similar illnesses.

OBJECTIVE: The increased life expectancy of people living with HIV has brought 
about an increase in serodiscordant couples, in which there is risk of HIV 
transmission. Therefore, interventions that promote sexual health and reduce 
risk are critical to develop for these couples. Given the disproportionate 
burden of HIV among populations of color, it is also critical that these 
interventions are culturally congruent. The EBAN intervention for African 
American serodiscordant couples recognizes the centrality of culture in shaping 
sexual behaviors and helps couples develop intimacy and positive prevention 
behaviors. The analytic objective of our study was to examine the knowledge and 
awareness gained by participants in the intervention.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n=17) who completed at least half of the eight 
intervention sessions.
METHODS: Brief post-implementation semi-structured interviews were conducted 
between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Team-based, targeted content 
analysis focused on knowledge and awareness gains.
RESULTS: Participants described learning about sexual health, expanded sexual 
options, and sexual communication. The "EBAN café," a component that gives 
couples a menu of options for safer sex behaviors, was particularly popular. 
Participants also noted the value of learning how to communicate with one 
another about their sexual health-related concerns and preferences. They 
appreciated the "cultural stuff" that was infused throughout the sessions, 
including the emphasis on learning from one another as couples.
CONCLUSIONS: Couples at risk for HIV transmission benefit from strengthening 
skills and knowledge related to healthy sexuality. A behavioral intervention 
that aligns with cultural values and imparts culturally congruent sexual health 
information appeals to couples who seek ways to enhance their intimacy and 
sexual options while also reducing risk.

BACKGROUND: Few data address modalities for speeding up functional independence 
in subjects included in a fast-track approach after total hip arthroplasty 
(THA). The study aim was to assess short-term effects of mobilization and 
walking the day of THA (WDS) on independence, pain, function and quality of 
life.
METHODS: Seventy-one patients were allocated in a study (SG: n = 36) or control 
(CG: n = 35) groups according to time of surgery and recovery from anesthesia. 
Patients who recovered lower limbs sensitivity (disappearance of sensation 
deficits) and motility (MRC scale ≥3 at knee, ankle and great toe extension) by 
7.00 p.m. made up the SG, whereas patients who underwent surgery later and 
recovered from anesthesia after 7.00 p.m. made up the CG. SG underwent WDS, 
whereas CG performed mobilization and walking the day after surgery starting the 
same physiotherapy program 1 day later. Patients were evaluated for independence 
(Functional Independence Measure - FIM), pain (Numeric Rating Scale - NRS), hip 
function (Harris Hip Score - HHS) and quality of life (EuroQoL-5Dimension - EQ. 
5D and EQ. 5D-VAS)the day before surgery, at 3 and 7 days in a hospital setting. 
Analysis of Covariance with age (SG: mean 60.9, SD 9.0; CG: mean 65.5, SD 8.9) 
and BMI (SG: mean 27.4, SD 2.8; CG: mean 26.7, SD 2.4) as covariates was used to 
assess between-group differences over time.
RESULTS: Between-groups differences were observed for FIM total and motor scores 
(p = 0.002, mean difference: 2.1, CI95: 0.64, 3.7) and FIM self-care (p = 0.01, 
mean difference: 1.7, CI95: 0.41, 3) in favor of SG at 3 days. Between-group 
differences were found for FIM self-care (p = 0.021, mean difference: 1.2, CI95: 
0.18, 2.1) in favor of SG at 7 days. FIM total and motor scores (p <  0.001), 
FIM self-care (p = 0.027) and transfer-locomotion (p <  0.001) and HHS 
(p = 0.032) decreased after surgery followed by improvements in postoperative 
days (p ≤ 0.001). No differences were found for NRS, EQ. 5D and EQ. 5D-VAS.
CONCLUSIONS: WDS produces additional benefits in patients' independence in the 
first week after THA. Absence of pain aggravation or adverse effects on hip 
function and quality of life may allow clinicians to recommend WDS to promote 
discharge with functional independence.

4600 Silver Hill Road, Room 5K127, Suitland, MD, 20746, United States.

OBJECTIVE: We addressed three research questions: (1) Are there racial mortality 
disparities in the adult Hispanic population that resemble those observed in the 
non-Hispanic population in the US? (2) Does nativity mediate the race-mortality 
relationship in the Hispanic population? and (3) What does the Hispanic 
mortality advantage relative to the non-Hispanic white population look like when 
Hispanic race is considered?
METHODS: We estimated a series of parametric hazard models on eight years of 
mortality follow-up data and calculated life expectancy estimates using the 
Mortality Disparities in American Communities database.
RESULTS: Hispanic white adults experience lower mortality than their Hispanic 
black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Some Other Race, and multiple race 
counterparts. This Hispanic white advantage is found mostly among the US born. 
The Hispanic advantage relative to the non-Hispanic white population operates 
for most Hispanic race groups among the foreign born but either disappears or 
converts to a disadvantage for most of the non-white Hispanic groups among the 
US born.
CONTRIBUTION: Our study extends the literature on the Hispanic Mortality Paradox 
by revealing that the adult Hispanic population experiences racial mortality 
disparities that closely resemble those observed in the non-Hispanic population. 
The Hispanic mortality advantage is mediated not only by nativity but by race. 
These results indicate that race is a critical factor that should be considered 
in any study with the goal of understanding the health and mortality profiles of 
the Hispanic population in the US.

Looking for an explanation for the excessive male mortality in England and Wales 
since the end of the 19th century.

Several papers have primarily considered a female disadvantage in mortality as 
something to explain, considering a male disadvantage to be a "natural 
condition". Even if, due to biological reasons, shorter life expectancy among 
males has been demonstrated, other factors need to be involved to explain 
firstly the increasing, and then the decreasing, of the male relative 
disadvantage over the past century. The principal aim of this paper is to 
provide a clearer picture of the major age-class and cause-of-death 
contributions to male excess mortality in England and Wales from 1881 to 2011. 
Results indicate a clear shift in contributions to the male disadvantage from 
differences occurring during the first year of life to those occurring in ageing 
people, and from tuberculosis, respiratory diseases, external causes and 
perinatal and congenital conditions to neoplasms and circulatory diseases. In 
contrast, the narrowing of the gap since 1981 seems to be most closely related 
to the decrease in the male disadvantage in respiratory diseases and to the 
simultaneous increasing in the female disadvantage in old-age diseases. The most 
important novelty of this research relates to the method: instead of using 
ratios to investigate gender differences in health, we use decomposition 
methods.

Species interaction networks, which play an important role in determining 
pathogen transmission and spread in ecological communities, can shift in 
response to agricultural landscape simplification. However, we know surprisingly 
little about how landscape simplification-driven changes in network structure 
impact epidemiological patterns. Here, we combine mathematical modelling and 
data from eleven bipartite plant-pollinator networks observed along a landscape 
simplification gradient to elucidate how changes in network structure shape 
disease dynamics. Our empirical data show that landscape simplification reduces 
pathogen prevalence in bee communities via increased diet breadth of the 
dominant species. Furthermore, our empirical data and theoretical model indicate 
that increased connectance reduces the likelihood of a disease outbreak and 
decreases variance in prevalence among bee species in the community, resulting 
in a dilution effect. Because infectious diseases are implicated in pollinator 
declines worldwide, a better understanding of how land use change impacts 
species interactions is therefore critical for conserving pollinator health.

BACKGROUND: Many domiciliary care workers have reported low confidence and 
isolation when delivering end of life care in patients' homes. Project Extension 
for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) is an initiative that has demonstrated 
success in increasing confidence and knowledge of end of life care in UK nursing 
home and community hospice workers, but it has not been evaluated with 
domiciliary care workers.
AIM: To test the acceptability of Project ECHO to domiciliary care workers as a 
means of increasing their knowledge of, and confidence in, delivering palliative 
care, and its effectiveness in reducing their isolation by developing a 
community of practice.
METHOD: A service evaluation, involving one domiciliary care agency delivering 
care in the community, was conducted from May 2018 to April 2019. The 
participants were 25 home care workers who were employed by the agency. 
Participants were invited to attend an event at which gaps in their knowledge 
were identified, and a curriculum of learning on the Project ECHO programme was 
developed. The learning involved 12 educational sessions over 12 months, with 
each session teaching a different component of palliative care. Questionnaires 
were completed by the participants before and after the educational sessions to 
assess their effect. In addition, a focus group was conducted with four of the 
participants.
RESULTS: Comparison of the questionnaires completed before and after 
participating in the education sessions revealed an increase in self-reported 
knowledge across all 12 topics of the curriculum and an increase in confidence 
in seven of the 12 topics. However, attendance across the 12 sessions was 
variable, with no more than nine being attended by any one participant.
CONCLUSION: Palliative care education for domiciliary care staff using ECHO 
methodology was well received, relevant and accessible, and may have the 
potential to improve self-assessed knowledge and confidence. However, finding an 
ideal time for as many staff to attend as possible may be challenging.

Underestimating the Value of an Intervention: The Case for Including 
Productivity in Value Assessments and Formulary Design.

BACKGROUND: Value assessment reports are increasingly being considered in health 
care coverage decisions. The inputs included and analytic methodologies 
underlying these reports should include all components of value.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether and how productivity was included in a value 
assessment, compare the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(cost/QALY) estimates with and without productivity, assess if inclusion of 
productivity changed the value category and estimate the direction and magnitude 
of change.
METHODS: We reviewed pharmaceutical value assessment reports published between 
March 2017 and July 2019 by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review 
(ICER) to determine whether productivity was included and how it was reported 
(i.e., co-base case or scenario analysis). Within each report, we identified 
unique treatment comparisons for which modelers estimated an incremental 
cost/QALY. We categorized the incremental cost/QALY estimates using ICER's 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) categories and assessed if inclusion of productivity 
changed the value category (i.e., < $50,000/QALY). For reports that included 2 
numerical estimates, we assessed the direction and magnitude of change when 
productivity was included.
RESULTS: Of the 19 reports that evaluated pharmaceutical treatments, 18 (94.7%) 
included productivity. Two reports (11.1%) incorporated productivity in a 
co-base case analysis, and 16 included productivity in a scenario analysis. 
Across these 18 reports, there were 75 unique comparisons of pharmaceutical 
interventions. Across the 75 comparisons, 4 (5.3%), 3 (4.0%), 8 (10.6%), and 1 
(1.3%) of the coverage decisions would change at the $50,000/QALY, 
$100,000/QALY, $150,000/QALY, and $500,000/QALY threshold, respectively. Sixty 
comparisons included 2 numerical cost/QALY estimates. The magnitude of change in 
the cost/QALY, after including productivity, ranged from -80.1% to 6.8%. The 
estimated value increased for 54 (72%), decreased for 5 (6.6%), and did not 
change for 1 (1.7%) of the comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: Value assessment should capture the range of costs and benefits of 
an intervention. The exclusion of productivity costs can alter, often 
underestimating, the assessment of value. This may affect coverage 
decisions-inclusion or exclusion from the insurance benefit-based on these 
assessments. Value assessment reports intended to be used for health care 
decision making should include productivity and elevate its visibility by using 
base-case analyses rather than scenario analyses.

BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is an emerging effective treatment option for 
adolescents suffering from morbid obesity. However, the surgery is often in high 
demand with long waiting periods. No prior research regarding the significance 
of waiting periods for bariatric surgery in adolescents was found. Our study 
aimed to evaluate changes in weight trends in adolescent candidates for 
bariatric surgery during the waiting period between acceptance and admission to 
the bariatric process (pre-surgical preparation, surgery, and follow-up).
METHODS: Fifty-one adolescent bariatric surgery candidates were accepted and 
subsequently admitted to the bariatric process. BMI data was retrieved from 
medical files and direct measurements, and BMI-change trends during the waiting 
period were compared with naturalistic trends (i.e., prior to the first 
evaluation for bariatric surgery).
RESULTS: Naturalistic BMI-trends showed an average gain of 0.3 BMI points 
per-month. After acceptance to the bariatric process and during the waiting 
period, this figure dropped, and candidates for surgery lost an average of 0.06 
BMI points per-month. Waiting periods lasted an average of 5.2 months. Shorter 
waiting periods were associated with better weight reduction and maintenance.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in weight-gaining trends occurred during 
the waiting period for bariatric surgery in adolescents, which may reflect 
motivational and lifestyle changes due to expectancy for surgery. Decision 
makers may aim for short waiting periods in order to capitalize on this effect. 
Further research needs to be conducted in order to clarify the effects of 
waiting periods for bariatric surgery in adolescents.

Most patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are aged over 70 years old, and half of 
those who die are over 83 years old. Older patients do not always present with 
typical symptoms (fever, cough and dyspnoea) but sometimes are and remain 
asymptomatic (contact screening), or have aspecific presentations (altered 
general condition, falls, delirium, unusual fatigue). Rectal swab, which 
minimizes exposition risk, appears useful in long-term care patients with 
diarrhea. Older age is associated with worse prognosis, but the analysis should 
be refined by means of prognostic indexes that account for the heterogeneous 
health, functional, and cognitive status of the elderly population. Gathering 
elderly patients' wishes and assessing their remaining life expectancy allows to 
anticipate care decisions according to the level of tension in the health 
system.

Because of the rising health care costs in the United States, there has been a 
focus on value-based care and improving the cost-effectiveness of surgical 
procedures. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) can not only give 
physicians and health care providers immediate feedback on the well-being of the 
patients but also be used to assess health and determine outcomes for surgical 
research purposes. Recently, PROMs have become a prominent tool to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of spine surgery by calculating the improvement in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The cost of a procedure per QALY gained is 
an essential metric to determine cost-effectiveness in universal health care 
systems. Common patient-reported outcome questionnaires to calculate QALY 
include the EuroQol-5 dimensions, the SF-36, and the SF-12. On the basis of the 
health-related quality of life outcomes, the cost-effectiveness of various spine 
surgeries can be determined, such as cervical fusions, lumbar fusions, 
microdiscectomies. As the United States attempts to reduce costs and emphasize 
value-based care, PROMs may serve a critical role in spine surgery moving 
forward. In addition, PROM-driven QALYs may be used to analyze novel spine 
surgical techniques for value-based improvements.

Background: Hybrid closed-loop systems may offer improved HbA1c levels, more 
time-in-range, and less hypoglycemia than alternative treatment strategies. 
However, it is unclear if glycemic improvements offset this technology's higher 
acquisition costs. Among adults with type 1 diabetes in Australia, we sought to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a hybrid closed-loop system in comparison 
with the current standard of care, comprising insulin injections and capillary 
glucose testing. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using 
decision analysis in combination with a Markov model to simulate disease 
progression in a cohort of adults with type 1 diabetes and compare the 
downstream health and economic consequences of hybrid closed-loop therapy versus 
current standard of care. Transition probabilities and utilities were sourced 
from published studies. Costs were considered from the perspective of the 
Australian health care system. A lifetime horizon was considered, with annual 
discount rates of 5% applied to future costs and outcomes. Uncertainty was 
assessed with probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Results: Use 
of a hybrid closed-loop system resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of Australian dollars (AUD) 37,767 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained. This is below the traditionally cited willingness to pay a threshold of 
$50,000 per QALY gained in the Australian setting. Sensitivity analyses that 
varied baseline glycemic control, treatment effects, technology costs, age, 
discount rates, and time horizon indicated the results to be robust. 
Conclusions: For adults with type 1 diabetes, hybrid closed-loop therapy is 
likely to be cost-effective compared with multiple daily injections and 
capillary glucose testing in Australia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease affecting the 
elderly. AD is associated with a progressive decline in memory and cognitive 
abilities, drastic changes in behavioural patterns and other psychiatric 
manifestations. It leads to a significant decline in the quality of life at 
personal, household as well as national level. Although AD was described about 
hundred years back and multiple theories have been proposed, its exact 
pathophysiology is unknown. There is no cure for AD and the life expectancy of 
AD patients remains low at 3-9 years. An accurate understanding of the molecular 
mechanism(s) involved in the pathogenesis of AD is imperative to devise a 
successful treatment strategy. This review explains and summarises the current 
understanding of different therapeutic strategies based on various molecular 
pathways known to date. Different strategies based on anti-amyloid pathology, 
glutamatergic pathway, anti-tau, neuroprotection through neurotrophic factors 
and cholinergic neurotransmission have been discussed. Further, the use of 
anti-inflammatory drugs, nutraceuticals, and dietary interventions has also been 
explained in the management of AD. It further describes different 
pharmacological and dietary interventions being used in treating and/or managing 
AD. Additionally, this article provides a thorough review of the literature for 
improving the therapeutic paradigm of AD.

In this paper, we develop a generator to propose new continuous lifetime 
distributions. Thanks to a simple transformation involving one additional 
parameter, every existing lifetime distribution can be rendered more flexible 
with our construction. We derive stochastic properties of our models, and 
explain how to estimate their parameters by means of maximum likelihood for 
complete and censored data, where we focus, in particular, on Type-II, Type-I 
and random censoring. A Monte Carlo simulation study reveals that the estimators 
are consistent. To emphasize the suitability of the proposed generator in 
practice, the two-parameter Fréchet distribution is taken as baseline 
distribution. Three real life applications are carried out to check the 
suitability of our new approach, and it is shown that our extension of the 
Fréchet distribution outperforms existing extensions available in the 
literature.

An alarming number of traffic-related deaths occur each year on European roads 
alone. Figures reveal that the vast majority of road-traffic accidents are 
caused by drivers themselves, and so further improvements in road safety require 
developments in driver training and rehabilitation. This study evaluated a novel 
approach to driver rehabilitation-specifically, empathy induction as a means of 
changing attitudes towards risky driving. To assess the effectiveness of this 
method, the present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
to compare brain function before and after a short program of empathy induction 
in 27 drivers whose licenses had been revoked after serious traffic offences 
(rehabilitated drivers [RDs]). In an extension of our previous research, we 
first assessed whether neural responses to empathy-eliciting social stimuli 
changed in these RDs. In order to isolate the neurophysiological effects of 
empathy induction from any other potential influences, we compared these RDs to 
a sample of 27 age-, handedness- and driving experience-matched control drivers 
(CDs) who had no exposure to the program. We then performed dual-fMRI 
"hyperscanning" to evaluate whether empathy induction changed brain responses 
during real-world social interactions among drivers; namely, during co-operative 
and/or competitive exchanges. Our data reveal that RDs exhibited weaker brain 
responses to socio-emotional stimuli compared with CDs prior to the program, but 
this difference was reversed after empathy induction. Moreover, we observed 
differences between pre- and post-program assessments in patterns of brain 
responses in RDs elicited during competitive social exchanges, which we 
interpret to reflect a change in their proclivity to react to the perceived 
wrong-doing of other road users. Together, these findings suggest that empathy 
induction is an effective form of driver rehabilitation, and the utility of 
neuroscientific techniques for evaluating and improving rehabilitation programs.

BACKGROUND: The future burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) depends on 
numerous factors such as population ageing, evolution of societal trends, 
behavioural and physiological risk factors of individuals (e.g. smoking, alcohol 
use, obesity, physical inactivity, and hypertension). This study aims to assess 
the burden of NCDs in Europe by 2050 under alternative scenarios.
METHODS: This study combines qualitative and quantitative forecasting techniques 
to examine how population health in Europe may evolve from 2015 to 2050, taking 
into account future societal trends. Four scenarios were developed (one 
business-as-usual scenario, two response scenarios and one pessimistic scenario) 
and assessed against 'best' and 'worst'-case scenarios. This study provides 
quantitative estimates of both diseases and mortality outcomes, using a 
microsimulation model incorporating international survey data.
FINDINGS: Each scenario is associated with a different risk factor prevalence 
rate across Europe during the period 2015-2050. The prevalence and incidence of 
NCDs consistently increase during the analysed time period, mainly driven by 
population ageing. In more optimistic scenarios, diseases will appear in later 
ages, while in the pessimistic scenarios, NCDs will impair working-age people. 
Life expectancy is expected to grow in all scenarios, but with differences by up 
to 4 years across scenarios and population groups. Premature mortality from NCDs 
will be reduced in more optimistic scenarios but stagnate in the worst-case 
scenario.
INTERPRETATION: Population ageing will have a greater impact on the spread of 
NCDs by 2050 compared to risk factors. Nevertheless, risk factors, which are 
influenced by living environments, are an important factor for determining 
future life expectancy in Europe.
