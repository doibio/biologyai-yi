mortality and life expectancy. We used linear regressions, accounting for 
provincial fixed effects and time, and controlling for confounding variables at 
the provincial level.
RESULTS: A 1-cent increase in social spending per dollar spent on health was 
associated with a 0.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04% to 0.16%) decrease in 
potentially avoidable mortality and a 0.01% (95% CI 0.01% to 0.02%) increase in 
life expectancy. The ratio had a statistically nonsignificant relationship with 
infant mortality (p = 0.2).
INTERPRETATION: Population-level health outcomes could benefit from a 
reallocation of government dollars from health to social spending, even if total 
government spending were left unchanged. This result is consistent with other 
findings from Canada and the United States.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of an 
internet-based perioperative care programme compared with usual care for 
gynaecological patients.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation from a societal perspective alongside a 
stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial with 12 months of follow-up.
SETTING: Secondary care, nine hospitals in the Netherlands, 2011-2014.
PARTICIPANTS: 433 employed women aged 18-65 years scheduled for a hysterectomy 
and/or laparoscopic adnexal surgery.
INTERVENTION: The intervention comprised an internet-based care programme aimed 
at improving convalescence and preventing delayed return to work (RTW) following 
gynaecological surgery and was sequentially rolled out. Depending on the 
implementation phase of their hospital, patients were allocated to usual care 
(n=206) or to the intervention (n=227).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was duration until full sustainable 
RTW. Secondary outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health-related 
quality of life and recovery.
RESULTS: At 12 months, there were no statistically significant differences in 
total societal costs (€-647; 95% CI €-2116 to €753) and duration until RTW 
(-4.1; 95% CI -10.8 to 2.6) between groups. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) for RTW was 56; each day earlier RTW in the intervention group was 
associated with cost savings of €56 compared with usual care. The probability of 
the intervention being cost-effective was 0.79 at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 
€0 per day earlier RTW, which increased to 0.97 at a WTP of €76 per day earlier 
RTW. The difference in QALYs gained over 12 months between the groups was 
clinically irrelevant resulting in a low probability of cost-effectiveness for 
QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering that on average the costs of a day of sickness absence 
are €230, the care programme is considered cost-effective in comparison with 
usual care for duration until sustainable RTW after gynaecological surgery for 
benign disease. Future research should indicate whether widespread 
implementation of this care programme has the potential to reduce societal costs 
associated with gynaecological surgery.

INTRODUCTION: Generic instruments for assessing health-related quality of life 
may lack the sensitivity to detect changes in health specific to certain 
conditions, such as dementia. The Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease 
(QOL-AD) is a widely used and well-validated condition-specific instrument for 
assessing health-related quality of life for people living with dementia, but it 
does not enable the calculation of quality-adjusted life years, the basis of 
cost utility analysis. This study will generate a preference-based scoring 
algorithm for a health state classification system -the Alzheimer's Disease Five 
Dimensions (AD-5D) derived from the QOL-AD.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Discrete choice experiments with duration (DCETTO) and 
best-worst scaling health state valuation tasks will be administered to a 
representative sample of 2000 members of the Australian general population via 
an online survey and to 250 dementia dyads (250 people with dementia and their 
carers) via face-to-face interview. A multinomial (conditional) logistic 
framework will be used to analyse responses and produce the utility algorithm 
for the AD-5D.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The algorithms developed will enable prospective and 
retrospective economic evaluation of any treatment or intervention targeting 
people with dementia where the QOL-AD has been administered and will be 
available online. Results will be disseminated through journals that publish 
health economics articles and through professional conferences. This study has 
ethical approval.

Baru is a native specie from the Brazilian "cerrado" with interesting 
nutritional and sensory characteristics. The aim of our study was to 
characterize baru nut flour (BF) and to explore the possibility of producing 
reduced-fat baru cupcakes. Four different cupcake formulations were produced 
wheat flour (WF) containing 30% BF with reductions of 50 (F1), 75 (F2) and 100% 
(F3) margarine, compared to a control with 100% WF and 100% margarine (FC). BF 
showed 2.76% moisture, 19.2% proteins, 40.8% lipids, 3.05% ash and 18.51% 
dietary fiber. The substitution of wheat flour with 30% BF increased the mixing 
tolerance index and resistance to extension in the rheological analyses; 
however, these changes did not greatly influence cupcake quality. Firmness was 
the parameter most affected during shelf life, with statistically significant 
differences between the formulations. The cupcakes prepared with the blend of 
70% WF + 30% BF and with fat reductions (F2 and F3) can be considered "light", 
with the reduction of more than 30% margarine and a significant reduction of 
trans fatty acids. In the sensory analysis, formulation F2 obtained good 
acceptance scores.

Primary amyloidosis (PA) is a protein deposition disorder that presents with 
localized or multisystemic disease. The incidence is low in the general public, 
ranging from three to eight cases per million, and with nonspecific presenting 
symptoms typically occurring later in life. Due to late presentation, 
substantial and irreversible damage has usually already occurred by the time of 
the diagnosis. However, if inadvertent diagnosis occurs before irreversible 
damage has taken place, as it did in the following case, some patients may 
benefit from the disease-arresting treatment. A 70-year-old female with a 
history of obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and arthritis presented with 
worsening dysphagia and biochemically confirmed primary hyperparathyroidism 
(PHPT). Further workup demonstrated multinodular goiter with compressive 
symptoms and substernal extension, osteopenia, and discrepant parathyroid 
localization on imaging. Intraoperatively, markedly difficult dissection and 
obliteration of tissue planes were encountered. Extensive, diffuse amyloid 
deposition in both the normal and pathologic parathyroid glands and thyroid 
tissue on surgical pathology leads to subsequent fibril typing by mass 
spectrometry and leads to the diagnostic of primary amyloid light-chain (AL) 
amyloidosis (PA; λ light chains). Subsequent workup for the underlying cause of 
the amyloid deposition revealed an immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of 
unknown significance. The surgical treatment of PHPT and compressive thyroid 
nodule unmasked an undiagnosed PA, allowing for early workup and monitoring of 
the progression of amyloidosis. The temporal comorbidity of PHPT and PA raises 
an interesting and, as yet, unanswered question regarding the pathophysiologic 
association between the two conditions.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are exposed to increased number of medications, 
often with no proof of a positive benefit/risk ratio. Unfortunately, this trend 
does not spare those with limited life expectancy, including end-stage cancer 
patients who require only palliative treatment. For many medications in this 
subpopulation, the risk of adverse drug events outweighs the possible benefits 
and yet, many are still poly-medicated during their last year of life.
AIM: To describe the extent of polypharmacy among end-stage cancer patients, at 
the time of admission to homecare hospice.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 202 patients admitted to Homecare 
Hospice of the Israel Cancer Association and died before January 2015.
RESULTS: Average lifespan from admission until death was 39.2 ± 5.4 days. 63% 
died within the first month, 89% within 3 months. Excluding oncological 
treatments, 181 (90%) and 46 (23%) patients were treated with ≥ 6 and ≥ 12 drugs 
for chronic diseases, respectively. Two months before death, 32 (16%) patients 
were treated with ≥ 3 blood pressure lowering drugs, 62 (31%) with statins and 
48 (23%) with aspirin.
CONCLUSION: Though not representative of the whole end-stage cancer patient 
population, our study demonstrates that these patients are exposed to extensive 
polypharmacy. Most of these medications could have probably been safely 
de-prescribed much earlier in the course of the malignant disease. Considering 
the prolonged trust-based relationship with their patients, the family 
physicians are those who should be encouraged to implement the palliative 
approach and reduce polypharmacy much before reaching hospice settings.

Aims: United States' (US) colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and treatment 
practices seek to reduce mortality. We examined the survival of US patients 
compared with patients in the virtually unscreened Norwegian population. 
Methods: We compared short-term survival after CRC between the US and Norway 
using relative survival (RS) and excess mortality (EMR) analyses. The CRC 
patients were aged 50 and older diagnosed in the US (Surveillance, Epidemiology 
and End Results registry, 2004, N=9511) and in Norway (Cancer Registry of 
Norway, 2003-2005, N=8256). Results: Death occurred within three years for 39% 
of the CRC patients. Stage distributions were more favorable for US patients. 
Stage-specific survival was similar for localized and regional cancers, but more 
favorable for US distant cancers. In multivariate models of patient, tumor and 
treatment characteristics, patients (especially below age 80) in the US 
experienced longer survival (EMR 0.9, CI 0.8-0.9). Stage-specific analyses 
showed, however, that survival for localized cancers was relatively shorter in 
the US than in Norway (EMR 1.4, CI 1.1-1.8), but longer for distant cancers (EMR 
0.8, CI 0.7-0.8). Conclusions: The enhanced survival for US CRC patients likely 
reflects a screening-related earlier diagnostic stage distribution, as well as 
prioritized life extension for patients with metastatic cancers, reflecting 
vastly different health care systems in the two countries. CRC screening is 
currently under consideration in Norway. For survival outcomes, the current 
findings do not discourage such an implementation. Other screening-related 
aspects such as feasibility and cost-benefit are, however, also relevant and 
warrant further research within a socialized health system.

Previous studies in Sweden have focused on a number of indicators to assess and 
compare health conditions at regional levels over time. In this study we aimed 
to give a more complete picture of the health situation in Stockholm County 
compared to the rest of Sweden, by using the DALY measure (disability-adjusted 
life years). DALY combines life lost to premature death (YLL) and years lived 
with disability (YLD) in one measure, and also allow comparisons of fatal and 
non-fatal conditions. This approach reveals that low back and neck pain and 
ischemic heart disease dominated the disease burden in 2015. Moreover, the 
health progress in Stockholm County has been better than the rest of Sweden 
since 1990, and the main reason is the decrease in premature death (YLL). This 
can partly be explained by a decrease in risk factors such as unhealthy diets, 
high blood pressure, tobacco smoking, high BMI and physical inactivity. The 
development of YLD has been relatively constant since 1990 in both Stockholm 
County and the rest of Sweden, implying that Sweden has been more successful in 
preventing death than reducing disability.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that nutritional habits, like those 
based on high consumption of fruits and vegetables, have been associated with a 
longer life expectancy and a significant decrease in the incidence and 
prevalence of several chronic diseases with inflammatory basis, such as 
cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This beneficial activity has been related to the 
content of several bioactive compounds in fruit and vegetables, such as 
polyphenols. The cardioprotective effects of polyphenols have been linked mainly 
to its antioxidant properties; however, recent findings attribute its 
anti-atherosclerotic potential to modulate simultaneous signaling and 
mechanistic pathways. Emerging data suggest that polyphenols can regulate 
cellular lipid metabolism; vascular and endothelial function; haemostasis; as 
well as platelet function; which represent primary conditions for 
atherosclerotic plaque formation and development. This review presents the 
results of a selection of experimental studies and clinical trials regarding the 
atheroprotective effects of the most common dietary polyphenols.

BACKGROUND: Concerns exist as to whether the allocation of resources in clinical 
research is aligned with public health needs. We evaluated the alignment between 
the effort of clinical research through the conduct of randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) and health needs measured as the burden of diseases for all 
regions and a broad range of diseases.
METHODS: We grouped countries into seven regions and diseases into 27 groups. We 
mapped all RCTs initiated between 2006 and 2015 that were registered at the WHO 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to regions and diseases. The 
burden of diseases in 2005 was mapped as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
based on the 2010 Global Burden of Diseases study. Within regions, we defined a 
research gap when the proportion of RCTs concerning a disease in the region was 
less than half the relative burden of the disease.
RESULTS: We mapped 117,180 RCTs planning to enroll 42.6 million patients and 
2,220 million DALYs. In high- versus non-high-income countries, 130.9 versus 6.9 
RCTs per million DALYs were conducted. We did not identify any research gap in 
high-income countries. We identified research gaps for all other regions. In 
particular, for Sub-Saharan Africa, we identified research gaps for common 
infectious diseases (CID) and neonatal disorders (ND): 5.8% (95% uncertainty 
interval 4.7-6.9) and 2.0% (0.9-4.5) of RCTs in Sub-Saharan Africa concerned CID 
and ND, although these diseases represented 22.9% and 11.6% of the burden in the 
region, respectively. For South Asia, we identified research gaps for the same 
two groups of diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: In non-high-income regions, the conduct of RCTs was misaligned with 
the distribution of major causes of burden, in particular infectious diseases 
and neonatal disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

BACKGROUND: Successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) relies on the optimal level 
of ART adherence to achieve reliable viral suppression, avert HIV drug 
resistance, and prevent avoidable deaths. It has been shown that there are 
various groups of people living with HIV at high-risk of non-adherence to ART in 
sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to examine the cost 
effectiveness and value-of-information of directly administered antiretroviral 
therapy (DAART) versus self-administered ART among people living with HIV, at 
high risk of non-adherence to ART in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A Markov model was developed that describes the transition 
between HIV stages based on the CD4 count, along with direct costs, quality of 
life and the mortality rate associated with DAART in comparison with 
self-administered ART. Data used in the model were derived from the published 
literature. A health system perspective was employed using a life-time time 
horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the 
impact of parameter uncertainty. Value of information analysis was also 
conducted. The expected cost of self-administered ART and DAART were $5,200 and 
$15,500 and the expected QALYs gained were 8.52 and 9.75 respectively, giving an 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $8,400 per QALY gained. The analysis 
demonstrated that the annual cost DAART needs to be priced below $200 per 
patient to be cost-effective. The probability that DAART was cost-effective was 
1% for a willingness to pay threshold of $5,096 for sub-Saharan Africa. The 
value of information associated with the cost of DAART and its effectiveness was 
substantial.
CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the health care payer in sub-Saharan 
Africa, DAART cannot be regarded as cost-effective based on current information. 
The value of information analysis showed that further research will be 
worthwhile and potentially cost-effective in resolving the uncertainty about 
whether or not to adopt DAART.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of population-based panel testing for high- 
and moderate-penetrance ovarian cancer (OC)/breast cancer (BC) gene mutations is 
unknown. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of population-based 
BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 mutation testing compared with clinical 
criteria/family history (FH) testing in unselected general population women.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model comparing lifetime costs and effects of 
criteria/FH-based BRCA1/BRCA2 testing is compared with 
BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing in those fulfilling clinical 
criteria/strong FH of cancer (≥10% BRCA1/BRCA2 probability) and all women age 30 
years or older. Analyses are presented for UK and US populations. Identified 
carriers undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 carriers 
can opt for magnetic resonance imaging/mammography, chemoprevention, or 
risk-reducing mastectomy. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) 
enabled model uncertainty evaluation. Outcomes include OC, BC, and additional 
heart disease deaths. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), OC incidence, BC 
incidence, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. The 
time horizon is lifetime and perspective is payer.
RESULTS: Compared with clinical criteria/FH-based BRCA1/BRCA2 testing, clinical 
criteria/FH-based BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing is 
cost-effective (ICER = £7629.65/QALY or $49 282.19/QALY; 0.04 days' 
life-expectancy gained). Population-based testing for 
BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 mutations is the most cost-effective 
strategy compared with current policy: ICER = £21 599.96/QALY or $54 769.78/QALY 
(9.34 or 7.57 days' life-expectancy gained). At £30 000/QALY and $100 000/QALY 
willingness-to-pay thresholds, population-based 
BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 panel testing is the preferred strategy in 
83.7% and 92.7% of PSA simulations; criteria/FH-based panel testing is preferred 
in 16.2% and 5.8% of simulations, respectively. Population-based 
BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing can prevent 1.86%/1.91% of BC and 
3.2%/4.88% of OC in UK/US women: 657/655 OC cases and 2420/2386 BC cases 
prevented per million.
CONCLUSIONS: Population-based BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing is 
more cost-effective than any clinical criteria/FH-based strategy. Clinical 
criteria/FH-based BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing is more 
cost-effective than BRCA1/BRCA2 testing alone.

BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab, an α4β7 integrin monoclonal antibody inhibiting gut 
lymphocyte trafficking, is an effective treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC). 
We evaluated the optimal position of vedolizumab in the UC treatment paradigm.
METHODS: Using Markov modeling, we assessed multiple algorithms for the 
treatment of UC. The base case was a 35-year-old male with steroid-dependent 
moderately to severely active UC without previous immunomodulator or biologic 
use. The model included 4 different algorithms over 1 year, with vedolizumab use 
prior to: initiating azathioprine (Algorithm 1), combination therapy with 
infliximab and azathioprine (Algorithm 2), combination therapy with an 
alternative anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) and azathioprine (Algorithm 
3), and colectomy (Algorithm 4). Transition probabilities and quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) estimates were derived from the published literature. Primary 
analyses included simulating 100 trials of 100,000 individuals, assessing 
clinical outcomes, and QALYs. Sensitivity analyses employed longer time horizons 
and ranges for all variables.
RESULTS: Algorithm 1 (vedolizumab use prior to all other therapies) was the 
preferred strategy, resulting in 8981 additional individuals in remission, 18 
fewer cases of lymphoma, and 1087 fewer serious infections per 100,000 patients 
compared with last-line use (A4). Algorithm 1 also resulted in 0.0197 to 0.0205 
more QALYs compared with other algorithms. This benefit increased with longer 
time horizons. Algorithm 1 was preferred in all sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: The model suggests that treatment algorithms positioning vedolizumab 
prior to other therapies should be considered for individuals with moderately to 
severely active steroid-dependent UC. Further prospective research is needed to 
confirm these simulated results.

BACKGROUND: Dual BRAF and MEK inhibition produces a response in a large number 
of patients with stage IV BRAF-mutant melanoma. The existing standard of care 
for patients with clinical stage III melanoma is upfront surgery and 
consideration for adjuvant therapy, which is insufficient to cure most patients. 
Neoadjuvant targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors (such as dabrafenib 
and trametinib) might provide clinical benefit in this high-risk p opulation.
METHODS: We undertook this single-centre, open-label, randomised phase 2 trial 
at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). 
Eligible participants were adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with histologically 
or cytologically confirmed surgically resectable clinical stage III or 
oligometastatic stage IV BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K (ie, Val600Glu or 
Val600Lys)-mutated melanoma. Eligible patients had to have an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, a life expectancy of 
more than 3 years, and no previous exposure to BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Exclusion 
criteria included metastases to bone, brain, or other sites where complete 
surgical excision was in doubt. We randomly assigned patients (1:2) to either 
upfront surgery and consideration for adjuvant therapy (standard of care group) 
or neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib (8 weeks of neoadjuvant 
oral dabrafenib 150 mg twice per day and oral trametinib 2 mg per day followed 
by surgery, then up to 44 weeks of adjuvant dabrafenib plus trametinib starting 
1 week after surgery for a total of 52 weeks of treatment). Randomisation was 
not masked and was implemented by the clinical trial conduct website maintained 
by the trial centre. Patients were stratified by disease stage. The primary 
endpoint was investigator-assessed event-free survival (ie, patients who were 
alive without disease progression) at 12 months in the intent-to-treat 
population. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02231775.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 23, 2014, and April 13, 2016, we randomly assigned seven 
patients to standard of care, and 14 to neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dabrafenib and 
trametinib. The trial was stopped early after a prespecified interim safety 
analysis that occurred after a quarter of the participants had been accrued 
revealed significantly longer event-free survival with neoadjuvant plus adjuvant 
dabrafenib and trametinib than with standard of care. After a median follow-up 
of 18·6 months (IQR 14·6-23·1), significantly more patients receiving 
neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib were alive without disease 
progression than those receiving standard of care (ten [71%] of 14 patients vs 
none of seven in the standard of care group; median event-free survival was 19·7 
months [16·2-not estimable] vs 2·9 months [95% CI 1·7-not estimable]; hazard 
ratio 0·016, 95% CI 0·00012-0·14, p<0·0001). Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant 
dabrafenib and trametinib were well tolerated with no occurrence of grade 4 
adverse events or treatment-related deaths. The most common adverse events in 
the neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib group were expected 
grade 1-2 toxicities including chills (12 patients [92%]), headache (12 [92%]), 
and pyrexia (ten [77%]). The most common grade 3 adverse event was diarrhoea 
(two patients [15%]).
INTERPRETATION: Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib 
significantly improved event-free survival versus standard of care in patients 
with high-risk, surgically resectable, clinical stage III-IV melanoma. Although 
the trial finished early, limiting generalisability of the results, the findings 
provide proof-of-concept and support the rationale for further investigation of 
neoadjuvant approaches in this disease. This trial is currently continuing 
accrual as a single-arm study of neoadjuvant plus adjuvant dabrafenib and 
trametinib.

The clinical relevance of the association between venous thromboembolism(VTE)and 
cancer is well documented. VTE is one of the leading causes of death in cancer 
patients. It would be an advantage to have knowledge on predictive parameters 
for the development of thrombosis and to be able to select cancer patients 
individually according to their riskprofiles. An elevated platelet count is 
associated with an increased riskof VTE in cancer patients. The biomarkers 
including D-dimer have been identified and used to extend the existing 
riskstratification. Treatment of VTE in cancer patients is complicated due to a 
high rate of recurrence in addition to a higher riskof bleeding during 
anticoagulation therapy. Current guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight 
heparin(LMWH)monotherapy over vitamin K antagonist(VKA)for the treatment of 
cancer-associated VTE. However, recent clinical study could not show any 
superior efficacy of LMWH over VKA in preventing VTE recurrence or overall 
mortality. The direct oral anticoagulants(DOACs)may be an effective treatment 
for VTE in cancer patients, although the riskreduction for recurrent VTE with 
the DOACs compared to LMWH has not been well assessed. Physicians should 
frequently re-evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of ongoing anticoagulation therapy 
in individual patient, in views of the overall clinical conditions including 
their quality of life and life expectancy.

PURPOSE: We previously developed a model to more accurately predict life 
expectancy for stage IV cancer patients referred to radiation oncology. The 
goals of this study are to validate this model and to compare competing 
published models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2012 to March 2015, 280 consecutive patientswith 
stage IV cancerwere prospectively evaluated by a single radiation oncologist. 
Patients were separated into training, validation and combined sets. TheNEAT 
model evaluated number of active tumors ("N"), Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group performance status ("E"), albumin ("A") and primary tumor site ("T"). The 
Odette Cancer Center model validated performance status, bone only metastases 
and primary tumor site. The Harvard TEACHH model investigated primary tumor 
type, performance status, age, prior chemotherapy courses, liver metastases, and 
hospitalization within 3 months. Cox multivariable analyses and 
logisticalregressionwere utilized to compare model performance.
RESULTS: Number of active tumors, performance status, albumin, primary tumor 
site, prior hospitalizationwithin the last 3 months, and liver metastases 
predicted overall survival on uinvariate and multivariable analysis (p < 0.05 
for all). The NEAT model separated patients into four prognostic groups with 
median survivals of 24.9, 14.8, 4.0, and 1.2 months, respectively (p < 0.001). 
The NEAT model had a C-index of 0.76 with a Nagelkerke's R2 of 0.54 suggesting 
good discrimination, calibration and total performance compared to competing 
prognostic models.
CONCLUSION: The NEAT model warrants further investigation as a clinically useful 
approach to predict survival in patients with stage IV cancer.

Psittacosis (infection with Chlamydia psittaci) can have diverse presentations 
in humans, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe systemic disease. 
Awareness of psittacosis and its presentations are low among clinicians and the 
general public. Therefore, underdiagnosis and thereby underestimation of the 
incidence and public health importance of psittacosis is very likely. We used 
the methodology developed for the Burden of communicable diseases in Europe 
toolkit of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, to construct 
a model to estimate disease burden in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
attributable to psittacosis. Using this model, we estimated the disease burden 
caused by psittacosis in the Netherlands to have been 222 DALY per year (95% CI 
172-280) over the period 2012-2014. This is comparable with the amount of DALYs 
estimated to be due to rubella or shigellosis in the same period in the 
Netherlands. Our results highlight the public health importance of psittacosis 
and identify evidence gaps pertaining to the clinical presentations and 
prognosis of this disease.

CONTEXT: Influenza vaccination rates remain below Healthy People 2020 goals. 
This project sought to systematically review economic evaluations of 
healthcare-based quality improvement interventions for improving influenza 
vaccination uptake among general populations and healthcare workers.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The databases MEDLINE, Econlit, Centre for Reviews & 
Dissemination, Greylit, and Worldcat were searched in July 2016 for papers 
published from January 2004 to July 2016. Eligible studies evaluated efforts by 
bodies within the healthcare system to encourage influenza vaccination by means 
of an organizational or structural change. For each study, program costs per 
enrollee and per additional enrollee vaccinated were derived (excluding vaccine 
costs, standardized to 2017 U.S. dollars). Complete economic evaluations were 
examined when available.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 2,350 records, 18 articles were eligible and described 29 
unique interventions. Most interventions improved vaccine uptake. Among 23 
interventions in general populations, the median program cost was $3.27 
(interquartile range, $0.82-$11.53) per enrollee and $50.78 (interquartile 
range, $27.85-$124.84) per additional enrollee vaccinated. Among ten complete 
economic evaluations in general populations, three studies reported net cost 
savings, four reported costs <$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year, and three 
reported costs <$60,000 per life saved. Among six interventions in healthcare 
workers, the median program cost was $8.09 (interquartile range, $5.03-$10.31) 
per worker enrolled and $125.24 (interquartile range, $96.06-$171.38) per 
additional worker vaccinated (there were no complete economic analyses).
CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement interventions for influenza vaccination involve
