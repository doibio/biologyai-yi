OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of different 
health-related quality-of-life valuation methods in a new setting. Based on a 
small feasibility study of 100 young Russians, we trialed different 
methodologies and identified key differences that have implications for the 
development of health technology assessment in Russia.
METHODS: In face-to-face interviews, respondents completed a series of health 
self-assessments based on a modified version of the EQ-5D-3L, visual analogue 
scale, time tradeoff, standard gamble, and best-worst scaling methodologies, 
covering actual and hypothetical health states.
RESULTS: We found that (1) the visual analogue scale produced lower health 
valuations and fewer logical inconsistencies than either time trade-off or 
standard gamble methodologies; (2) initial health states can be decisive in 
determining values assigned to health improvements; (3) respondents evaluate 
abstract health states more positively than their own actual health states; (4) 
there is evidence consistent with the hypothesis that actual and hypothetical 
health state valuation, using EQ-5D-3L, is an artifact of understanding rather 
than preference and that the incorporation of additional levels may therefore be 
no panacea if the dimensions themselves overlook important attributes; and (5) 
the country context is important in determining how respondents relate to the 
survey tools and how those survey tools are translated and delivered.
CONCLUSIONS: Russia is commencing its health technology assessment journey and 
should proceed cautiously as it moves toward the valuation of health benefits. 
These results suggest a useful framework for a more in-depth development of 
health valuation methodologies in Russia.

Reduced levels of physical activity in people's daily lives cause the 
development of metabolic syndromes or age-related disorders. Chronic 
inflammation is now understood to be an underlying pathological condition in 
which inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and monocyte/macrophages infiltrate 
into fat and other tissues and accumulate when people become obese due to 
overeating and/or physical inactivity. Pro-inflammatory mediators such as 
cytokines that are secreted in excess from inflammatory cells will not only lead 
to the development of arteriosclerosis when they chronically affect blood 
vessels but also bring tissue degeneration and/or dysfunction to various organs. 
Chronic inflammation is also involved in sarcopenia that brings hypofunction in 
the elderly, dementia, osteoporosis, or cancer and negatively affects many 
chronic diseases and people's healthy life expectancy. In this paper, outlines 
of such studies are introduced in terms of homeostatic inflammation, which 
occurs chronically due to the innate immune system and its abnormalities, while 
focusing on the efficacy of exercise from aspects of immunology and oxidative 
stress. The preventative effects of functional food ingredients in combination 
with exercise are also introduced and described. The challenges and future 
directions in understanding the role of exercise in the control of chronic 
inflammation are discussed.

Introduction The average life expectancy is increasing with better medical 
facilities and evolving technology. The ratio of the geriatric population is 
increasing, which drives a need to invest more in the physical and psychological 
health of older people. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of 
depression in community-dwelling healthy older adults.  Methods Geriatric 
Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) was utilized in this study. Community-dwelling 
older adults (age 65+ years) were approached in parks, mosques, grocery stores, 
and waiting areas of banks. Demographic information including age, gender, 
education, marital status, employment, and financial status, and family 
structure was recorded. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS v. 22.0. 
Results Out of the 367 elderly participants, there were 165 (45%) men and 202 
(55%) women. Depression was reported in 37% (n = 136) individuals; 29.7% (n = 
109) were suggestive of depression, while 33.2% (n = 122) were not depressed. 
Risk factors for the development of depression included female gender, not 
living with a spouse (separated/spouse died/single), being financially 
dependent, being employed, and living alone (not in a joint or nuclear family). 
Conclusion The incidence of depression is high among healthy community-dwelling 
elderly individuals in Pakistan. Geriatric health should be taken into 
consideration. There should be strategies and guidelines to screen the geriatric 
population for psycho-social symptoms and provide them with psychological 
counseling.

OBJECTIVES: To assess to what extent educational differences in total life 
expectancy (TLE) and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) could be reduced by 
improving fruit and vegetable consumption in ten European countries.
METHODS: Data from national census or registries with mortality follow-up, 
EU-SILC, and ESS were used in two scenarios to calculate the impact: the upward 
levelling scenario (exposure in low educated equals exposure in high educated) 
and the elimination scenario (no exposure in both groups). Results are estimated 
for men and women between ages 35 and 79 years.
RESULTS: Varying by country, upward levelling reduced inequalities in DFLE by 
0.1-1.1 years (1-10%) in males, and by 0.0-1.3 years (0-18%) in females. 
Eliminating exposure reduced inequalities in DFLE between 0.6 and 1.7 years for 
males (6-15%), and between 0.1 years and 1.8 years for females (3-20%).
CONCLUSIONS: Upward levelling of fruit and vegetable consumption would have a 
small, positive effect on both TLE and DFLE, and could potentially reduce 
inequalities in TLE and DFLE.

BACKGROUND: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is increasingly performed for 
Infliximab (IFX) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Reactive TDM is a 
cost-effective strategy to empiric IFX dose escalation. The cost-effectiveness 
of proactive TDM is unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of proactive vs reactive TDM in a simulated population of CD 
patients on IFX.
METHODS: We developed a stochastic simulation model of CD patients on IFX and 
evaluated the expected health costs and outcomes of a proactive TDM strategy 
compared with a reactive strategy. The proactive strategy measured IFX 
concentration and antibody status every 6 months, or at the time of a flare, and 
dosed IFX to a therapeutic window. The reactive strategy only did so at the time 
of a flare.
RESULTS: The proactive strategy led to fewer flares than the reactive strategy. 
More patients stayed on IFX in the proactive vs reactive strategy (63.4% vs 
58.8% at year 5). From a health sector perspective, a proactive strategy was 
marginally cost-effective compared with a reactive strategy (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $146,494 per quality-adjusted life year), assuming a 
40% of the wholesale price of IFX. The results were most sensitive to risk of 
flaring with a low IFX concentration and the cost of IFX.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming 40% of the average wholesale acquisition cost of biologic 
therapies, proactive TDM for IFX is marginally cost-effective compared with a 
reactive TDM strategy. As the cost of infliximab decreases, a proactive 
monitoring strategy is more cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CT-P10, a rituximab biosimilar 
after a single switch, during a multinational, randomized, double-blind Phase 3 
trial involving patients with RA.
METHODS: Patients received 48 weeks' treatment with CT-P10 or United States- or 
European Union-sourced reference rituximab (US-RTX and EU-RTX, respectively). 
Patients entering the extension period (weeks 48-72) remained on CT-P10 
(CT-P10/CT-P10; n = 122) or US-RTX (US-RTX/US-RTX; n = 64), or switched to 
CT-P10 from US-RTX (US-RTX/CT-P10; n = 62) or EU-RTX (EU-RTX/CT-P10; n = 47) for 
an additional course. Efficacy endpoints included Disease Activity Score using 
28 joints (DAS28), American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates, and 
quality of life-related parameters. Pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety 
were also assessed.
RESULTS: At week 72, similar improvements were observed by disease activity 
parameters including DAS28 and ACR response rate in the four extension period 
treatment groups. Quality of life improvements at week 72 vs baseline were 
similarly shown during the extension period in all groups. Newly developed 
anti-drug antibodies were detected in two patients following study drug infusion 
in the extension period. Similar pharmacodynamic and safety profiles were 
observed across groups.
CONCLUSION: Long-term use of CT-P10 up to 72 weeks was effective and well 
tolerated. Furthermore, switching from reference rituximab to CT-P10 in RA was 
well tolerated and did not result in any clinically meaningful differences in 
terms of efficacy, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety.

INTRODUCTION: Age range for cervical screening varies widely between countries. 
In addition, sexual behavior has changed, life expectancy is increasing, and new 
insights have been gained into the pathogenesis of HPV infection. Our aim is to 
evaluate the distribution of cervical lesions in young and older patients.
METHODS: Review of all cervical smears diagnosed in a public institution 
(2010-2017) and a private institution (2016-2017) in Madrid, Spain. We have 
included all women aged younger than 30 and older than 65 years with atypical 
smears (n = 1573).
RESULTS: Women younger than 30 years were diagnosed with ASCUS, ASC-H, LSIL, and 
HSIL in 47%, 5.3%, 45.17%, and 2.6% of atypical cases, respectively. Women older 
than 65 years were diagnosed with ASCUS, ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL, and SCC in 38%, 
12.39%, 16.8%, 13.27%, and 19.5% of atypical cases, respectively. Medical 
records of patients from the public institution were reviewed. Of note, 76.3% of 
young women showed negative smears at follow-up and 14.1% showed high-grade 
dysplasia (HGD). Mean ages for low-grade and HGD were 24.7 and 25.7 years, 
respectively. HGD was found in 37.9% of women with histological examination 
(33.5%). As for older patients, 25% of them had no Pap smears performed before 
age 65, and in 60% of the previously screened women, the screening program had 
not been used adequately. Mean age of first smear was 69.5 years. Carcinoma was 
subsequently detected in 20.7% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Current guidelines seem to be adequately preventing carcinoma in 
young women. However, screening adherence should be encouraged to detect 
important lesions in both age groups, especially among older women.

OBJECTIVE: Many researchers and physicians attempt to determine the prognosis 
and short- and long-term mortality risks of dementia for formulating suitable 
care plans for patients and their families. However, the published prediction 
models have been insufficient for this purpose and have worked only in certain 
specific populations. For medical autonomy and end-of-life decisions, an 
informative tool to predict 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year 
mortality rates for dementia patients merits further investigation.
METHODS: Patients aged ≥ 65 years who received ICD-9-CM diagnoses of dementia 
between 2002 and 2009 were identified from Taiwan's National Health Insurance 
Research Database and followed until the end of 2013. Patient characteristics 
and comorbidities that were considered potential risk factors for mortality were 
assessed. Mortality-predicting risk scores were developed using a regression 
coefficient-based scoring approach. In total, 6,556 patients were identified and 
then randomly divided into a derivation cohort (n = 4,371) and validation cohort 
(n = 2,185).
RESULTS: By the end of the study, 1,693 of the 4,371 dementia patients (38.7%) 
in the derivation cohort were deceased. Mean duration of follow-up was 6.26 
years. Eleven acute and chronic factors were identified for building the 
predictive score model, which produced scores from 0 to 24 points (higher scores 
indicated higher mortality). The score model exhibited good predictive power for 
various life expectancies (area under receiver operating characteristic curve: 
6-month = 0.852, 1-year = 0.779, 2-year = 0.725, 3-year = 0.721, 5-year = 0.703) 
and good calibration in the validation cohort (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, χ² = 4.709, 
P = .788).
CONCLUSIONS: The developed predictive score model may be the first tool that 
uses the same clinical factors to determine both short- and long-term mortality 
risks in patients with dementia.

The National Vaccine Prevention Plan considers the recommendations for immune 
prophylaxis in all ages of life. However, compulsory vaccination introduced in 
2017 focused the attention on improving global vaccination coverage in infants 
and children, giving less attention to adult/elderly vaccinations. The 
immunization of this population is necessary considering the change in the age 
structure of the population, whose average life expectancy is increasing. Aim of 
this work was the organization of continuing education courses about 
anti-Pneumococcus, anti-Herpes-Zoster and anti-Papillomavirus vaccinations to 
offer an update of knowledge and to discuss the attitudes of health 
professionals in vaccination centers of the Local Health Units in Rome.

BACKGROUND: Although Option B+ may be more costly than Options B, it may provide 
additional health benefits that are currently unclear in Yunnan province. We 
created deterministic models to estimate the cost-effectiveness of Option B+.
METHODS: Data were used in two deterministic models simulating a cohort of 2000 
HIV+ pregnant women. A decision tree model simulated the number of averted 
infants infections and QALY acquired for infants in the PMTCT period for Options 
B and B+. The minimum cost was calculated. A Markov decision model simulated the 
number of maternal life year gained and serodiscordant partner infections 
averted in the ten years after PMTCT for Option B or B+. ICER per life year 
gained was calculated. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: If fully implemented, Option B and Option B+ averted 1016.85 infections 
and acquired 588,01.02 QALYs.The cost of Option B was US$1,229,338.47, the cost 
of Option B+ was 1,176,128.63. However, when Options B and B+ were compared over 
ten years, Option B+ not only improved mothers'ten-year survival from 69.7 to 
89.2%, saving more than 3890 life-years, but also averted 3068 HIV infections 
between serodiscordant partners. Option B+ yielded a favourable ICER of 
$32.99per QALY acquired in infants and $5149per life year gained in mothers. A 
1% MTCT rate, a 90% coverage rate and a 20-year horizon could decrease the ICER 
per QALY acquired in children and LY gained in mothers.
CONCLUSIONS: Option B+ is a cost-effective treatment for comprehensive HIV 
prevention for infants and serodiscordant partners and life-long treatment for 
mothers in Yunnan province, China. Option B+ could be implemented in Yunnan 
province, especially as the goals of elimination mother-to-child transmission of 
HIV and "90-90-90" achieved, Option B+ would be more attractive.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity is an emerging public health priority. Physical 
activity (PA) is recommended as one of the main lifestyle behaviours, yet the 
benefits of PA for people with multimorbidity are unclear. We assessed the 
benefits of PA on mortality and life expectancy in people with and without 
multimorbidity.
METHODS: Using the UK Biobank dataset, we extracted data on 36 chronic 
conditions and defined multimorbidity as (a) 2 or more conditions, (b) 2 or more 
conditions combined with self-reported overall health, and (c) 2 or more top-10 
most common comorbidities. Leisure-time PA (LTPA) and total PA (TPA) were 
measured by questionnaire and categorised as low (< 600 metabolic equivalent 
(MET)-min/week), moderate (600 to < 3000 MET-min/week), and high (≥ 3000 
MET-min/week), while objectively assessed PA was assessed by wrist-worn 
accelerometer and categorised as low (4 min/day), moderate (10 min/day), and 
high (22 min/day) walking at brisk pace. Survival models were applied to 
calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and predict life expectancy differences.
RESULTS: 491,939 individuals (96,622 with 2 or more conditions) had a median 
follow-up of 7.0 (IQR 6.3-7.6) years. Compared to low LTPA, for participants 
with multimorbidity, HR for mortality was 0.75 (95% CI 0.70-0.80) and 0.65 
(0.56-0.75) in moderate and high LTPA groups, respectively. This finding was 
consistent when using TPA measures. Using objective PA, HRs were 0.49 
(0.29-0.80) and 0.29 (0.13-0.61) in the moderate and high PA groups, 
respectively. These findings were similar for participants without 
multimorbidity. In participants with multimorbidity, at the age of 45 years, 
moderate and high LTPA were associated with an average of 3.12 (95% CI 2.53, 
3.71) and 3.55 (2.34, 4.77) additional life years, respectively, compared to low 
LTPA; in participants without multimorbidity, corresponding figures were 1.95 
(1.59, 2.31) and 1.85 (1.19, 2.50). Similar results were found with TPA. For 
objective PA, moderate and high levels were associated with 3.60 (- 0.60, 7.79) 
and 5.32 (- 0.47, 11.11) life years gained compared to low PA for those with 
multimorbidity and 3.88 (1.79, 6.00) and 4.51 (2.15, 6.88) life years gained in 
those without. Results were consistent when using other definitions of 
multimorbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: There was an inverse dose-response association between PA and 
mortality. A moderate exercise is associated with a longer life expectancy, also 
in individuals with multimorbidity.

INTRODUCTION: Limb necrotising soft tissue infection and necrotising fasciitis 
surgical debridement results in significant soft tissue losses. The purpose of 
this study was to evaluate the functional impact and the quality of life of 
survivors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This bicentric retrospective study included 62 patients 
treated for limb necrotising soft tissue infection and necrotising fasciitis 
(NSTI-NF) between 2000 and 2017. Demographic, clinic, biologic and surgical data 
were found in Patients Medical Records. Survivors at the moment of data 
collection (2018) were met; their quality of life was assessed using SF-36, 
DLQI, BSHS-B scores and their active joints motions were measured using a 
goniometer.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (87.1% of the living patients at this moment) were 
assessed. For the joint above the injury, mean loss of flexion was 9.19% and 5% 
for extension whereas for the joint under the injury, mean loss of flexion was 
37.65% and 48.6% for extension compared to non-injured side. Mean quality of 
life scores were: SF-36p: 45.88, SF-36m: 51.31, DLQI: 10.48, BSHS-B: 105.81. The 
statistical analysis was not able to establish a correlation between loss of 
motion and quality of life.
CONCLUSION: We have not found a relationship between loss of joints motions and 
long term quality of life for those patients. High excised body surface area and 
high length of stay are correlated with high DLQI and thus a lower quality of 
life.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness studies gain importance in the context of rising 
health care expenses and treatment options. Especially in the neuro-oncological 
context, surgical therapy may increase overall survival, but restrain the 
patient by postoperative disability. Quality-adjusted life years, express 
treatment effects and are based on health utilities. In our study, we analyze 
the current evidence on health economic evaluations in glioma patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a systematic database search including 
Medline and Cochrane Library. Studies were critically appraised for statistical 
analyzes including glioma patients, health economic modeling and detailed health 
outcome. Study evidence was classified according to levels of evidence for 
therapeutic studies from the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (Oxford).
RESULTS: 37 studies (1995-2018) were identified, 29 matched our inclusion 
criteria. Studies addressed surgical cost-efficiency and/or the standard 
treatment, postoperative chemotherapy (n = 6) and 5-ALA (n = 3). Only 16 studies 
used QALY as the outcome measure, most used overall survival or life years 
gained (LYG). Utilities were either based on one single study (Garside et al. in 
Health Technol Assess 11:iii-iv, ix-221) or derived from visual analogue scale 
(VAS). None assessed quality of life values for specific health statuses or 
utilities. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied from 8325€ per QALY 
(5-ALA) to 518,342€ per LYG (tumor treating fields).
CONCLUSIONS: Only one study generated utility values to conduct 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA); most studies used indirect outcomes such as 
LYG or based their model on previously published data. Health economic 
evaluations lack specific utilities, further investigations are necessary to 
conduct reliable CEA in the neurosurgical context.

BACKGROUND: Economic burden estimates are essential to guide policy-making for 
influenza vaccination, especially in resource-limited settings.
METHODS: We estimated the cost, absenteeism, and years of life lost (YLL) of 
medically and non-medically attended influenza-associated mild and severe 
respiratory, circulatory and non-respiratory/non-circulatory illness in South 
Africa during 2013-2015 using a modified version of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) worksheet based tool for estimating the economic burden of 
seasonal influenza. Additionally, we restricted the analysis to 
influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and influenza-like 
illness (ILI; subsets of all-respiratory illnesses) as suggested in the WHO 
manual.
RESULTS: The estimated mean annual cost of influenza-associated illness was 
$270.5 million, of which $111.3 million (41%) were government-incurred costs, 
40.7 million (15%) were out-of-pocket expenses, and $118.4 million (44%) were 
indirect costs. The cost of influenza-associated medically attended mild illness 
($107.9 million) was 2.3 times higher than that of severe illness ($47.1 
million). Influenza-associated respiratory illness costs ($251.4 million) 
accounted for 93% of the total cost. Estimated absenteeism and YLL were 13.2 
million days and 304 867 years, respectively. Among patients with 
influenza-associated WHO-defined ILI or SARI, the costs ($95.3 million), 
absenteeism (4.5 million days), and YLL (65 697) were 35%, 34%, and 21% of the 
total economic and health burden of influenza.
CONCLUSION: The economic burden of influenza-associated illness was substantial 
from both a government and a societal perspective. Models that limit estimates 
to those obtained from patients with WHO-defined ILI or SARI substantially 
underestimated the total economic and health burden of influenza-associated 
illness.

Objectives: Over the last century, unthinkable goals have been achieved in 
health care and medical sciences, leading to longer life expectancy. Although 
cancer affects all ages, it disproportionately targets older individuals. Thus, 
surgical oncologists are confronted with increasing numbers of older patients 
presenting with multiple chronic conditions. We intended to investigate the 
safety of oncologic resection in older patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) 
based on perioperative outcomes. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively 
collected and analyzed data from older patients (>85 years) who underwent 
curative resection for stage II or III CRC between January 2007 and August 2017 
at four hospitals (St. Vincent's Hospital, Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul 
St. Mary's Hospital, and Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital). Results: A total of 140 
patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 87.1, the mean stay in 
the intensive care unit after surgery was 1.6 ± 3.8 days, and the mean 
postoperative hospital stay was 10.5 ± 3.8 days, D3 lymph node dissection was 
performed in 67.0% of patients, and D2 lymph node dissection was performed in 
33.0%. Postoperative complications occurred in 38 patients (27.9%). In the 
univariate analysis, the risk factors for postoperative complications were the 
omission of mechanical bowel preparation (P = .039) and open surgery (P = .031). 
Conclusions: Oncologic resection in selected older patients with CRC might be a 
relatively safe treatment option. In particular, a laparoscopic approach might 
be a safer surgical method than open surgery in older patients with CRC.

Can ICER bring cost-effectiveness to drug prices?

Butcher L.

Insurers and some drug manufacturers are turning to the Institute for Clinical 
and Economic Review (ICER) as the arbiter of drug prices, especially as prices 
soar and value is sought. But questions persist about the cost-effectiveness 
calculations of the Boston not-for-profit and its dependence on QALYs.

BACKGROUND: Intensive surveillance strategies are currently recommended for 
patients after curative treatment of colon cancer, with the aim of secondary 
prevention of recurrence. Yet, intensive surveillance has not yielded 
improvements in overall patient survival compared with minimal follow-up, and 
more intensive surveillance may be costlier.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate the quality-adjusted 
life-years, economic costs, and cost-effectiveness of various surveillance 
strategies after curative treatment of colon cancer.
DESIGN: A Markov model was calibrated to reflect the natural history of colon 
cancer recurrence and used to estimate surveillance costs and outcomes.
SETTINGS: This was a decision-analytic model.
PATIENTS: Individuals entered the model at age 60 years after curative treatment 
for stage I, II, or III colon cancer. Other initial age groups were assessed in 
secondary analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated the gains in quality-adjusted life-years 
achieved by early detection and treatment of recurrence, as well as the economic 
costs of surveillance under various strategies.
RESULTS: Cost-effective strategies for patients with stage I colon cancer 
improved quality-adjusted life-expectancy by 0.02 to 0.06 quality-adjusted 
life-years at an incremental cost of $1702 to $13,019. For stage II, they 
improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.03 to 0.09 quality-adjusted 
life-years at a cost of $2300 to $14,363. For stage III, they improved 
quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.03 to 0.17 quality-adjusted life-years for 
a cost of $1416 to $17,631. At a commonly cited willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the most cost-effective strategy for 
patients with a history of stage I or II colon cancer was liver ultrasound and 
chest x-ray annually. For those with a history of stage III colon cancer, the 
optimal strategy was liver ultrasound and chest x-ray every 6 months with CEA 
measurement every 6 months.
LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by model structure assumptions and 
uncertainty around the values of the model's parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Given currently available data and within the limitations of a 
model-based decision-analytic approach, the effectiveness of routine intensive 
surveillance for patients after treatment of colon cancer appears, on average, 
to be small. Compared with testing using lower cost imaging, currently 
recommended strategies are associated with cost-effectiveness ratios that 
indicate low value according to well-accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds in 
the United States. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A921.

The present research explored whether atheists managing death awareness would be 
effectively buffered by affirmations of supernatural and/or natural literal 
immortality. Prior data were reanalyzed, revealing ambiguous results, so further 
experiments were conducted. In Study 1 (n = 382), atheists were randomly 
assigned to a supernatural afterlife-confirmed (vs. afterlife-disconfirmed) 
prime, an MS (vs. control topic) prime, and then given an opportunity to engage 
in secular worldview defense. In Study 2 (n = 360), atheists were randomly 
assigned to supernatural (afterlife) versus natural (medical indefinite life 
extension; MILE) immortality prime, an MS (vs. control topic) prime, and then 
given an opportunity to engage in secular worldview defense. Atheists managing 
death awareness increased worldview defense in the supernatural/afterlife 
conditions but that effect was eliminated in the MILE condition. These findings 
are consistent with the terror management theory perspective on worldview 
defense. Implications for theory and research are discussed.

OBJECTIVE: Young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often struggle to achieve 
glycemic control and maintain routine clinic visits. We aimed to evaluate the 
societal cost-effectiveness of the Colorado young adults with T1D (CoYoT1) 
Clinic, an innovative care model of shared medical appointments through home 
telehealth.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients self-selected into the CoYoT1 (N = 42) or 
usual care (N = 39) groups.
RESULTS: Within the trial, we found no significant differences in 9-month 
quality-adjusted life; however, the control group had a larger decline from 
baseline in utility than the CoYoT1 group, indicating a quality of life (QoL) 
benefit of the intervention (difference in difference mean ± SD: 0.04 ± 0.09; P 
= 0.03). There was no significant difference in total costs. The CoYoT1 group 
had more study-related visits but fewer nonstudy office visits and 
hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: The CoYoT1 care model may help young adults with 
T1D maintain a higher QoL with no increase in costs.

Chemical coping also has an idea that it is an early stage of abuse and 
dependence of opioids, it is important to grasp the frequency, complaints, and 
risk factors of chemical coping. In this study, observational research was 
performed backwardly with 549 people using opioids who were newly requested to 
the palliative care team. Results revealed that 13 of 549 patients (2.4%)were 
diagnosed with chemical coping. In terms of a breakdown of the complaint, and it 
was following rate and reasons, 6 people(46%)felt easy, 2 people(15%)were 
anxious, 2 people(15%)could sleep, 2 people(15%)had unknown reasons, and 
1(8%)was calm. Characteristics of each patient diagnosed with chemical coping 
included frequent psychiatric symptoms such as life expectancy of 3 months, 
opioid oral administration period of 1 year or more, disease incidence period of 
1 year or more, anxiety, delirium, and depression. One benign disease also 
confirmed the transition to opioid dependence.
