BACKGROUND: The evidence base for internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy 
for insomnia (iCBT-I) is firm; however, little is known about iCBT-I's 
health-economic effects.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility 
of iCBT-I in reducing insomnia among schoolteachers.
METHODS: Schoolteachers (N=128) with clinically significant insomnia symptoms 
and work-related rumination were randomized to guided iCBT-I or a wait list 
control group, both with unrestricted access to treatment as usual. Health care 
use, patient and family expenditures, and productivity losses were self-assessed 
and used for costing from a societal and a public health care perspective. Costs 
were related to symptom-free status (score <8 on the insomnia severity index) 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Sampling error was handled using 
nonparametric bootstrapping.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences favoring the intervention group 
were found for both health outcomes (symptom-free status yes or no: β=.30; 95% 
CI 0.16-0.43; QALYs: β=.019, 95% CI 0.01-0.03). From a societal perspective, 
iCBT-I had a 94% probability of dominating the wait list control for both health 
outcomes. From a public health care perspective, iCBT-I was more effective but 
also more expensive than the wait list control, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €650 per symptom-free individual. In terms of QALYs, 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €11,285. At a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €20,000 per QALY gained, the intervention's probability of being 
cost-effective was 89%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our trial indicates that iCBT could be considered as a good 
value-for-money intervention for insomnia.

Population ageing resulting from declining fertility and extended life 
expectancy has been occurring rapidly throughout the world. Older adults are 
faced with multiple physical, psychological and social changes that challenge 
their sense of self and capacity for healthy ageing. Intergenerational 
programmes (IGP) in communities have been developed to address a variety of 
social issues brought about by the population ageing. These programmes focus on 
promoting intergenerational social contact, supporting educational programmes 
and facilitating intellectual and/or physical activities in the older adults. 
This study intended to explore the perception of community-dwelling older adults 
towards an IGP in a senior day care centre in Singapore. Purposive sampling was 
adopted to recruit 15 participants for the study. Individual face-to-face 
interviews were conducted until data saturation was achieved. Interviews were 
audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was carried out. Four 
themes and 13 sub-themes emerged: (1) IGP enhances memory and strength; (2) 
social interaction between older adults and younger generation; (3) emotional 
responses to IGP; and (4) attitudes and perception towards the younger 
generation. The current study illustrated the dynamic social interaction between 
older adults and the younger generation, as well as the perceived benefits of 
the IGP. The relationship formed between the two generations entailed 
companionship, mutual care, trust and affection. Participation in the IGP 
provided the older adults an opportunity for active engagement in society and 
development. Continuous effort must be put in to ensure continuity of 
integration and empowerment of older adults, including the removal of obstacles 
and barriers that exclude or discriminate against them. The study findings will 
help facilitate the customisation of IGP to meet the needs of the older adults. 
With a well-planned and structured IGP, significant physical, emotional and 
psychosocial outcomes could benefit the older adults and the younger generation.

Comment on
    Biochem J. 2021 Feb 26;478(4):811-837.

This commentary discusses general concepts introduced in the article 'Bulk 
autophagy induction and life extension is achieved when iron is the only limited 
nutrient in Saccharomyces cerevisiae' by Montella-Manuel et al. (Biochem J 
(2021) 478: 811-837). Montella-Manuel et al. show that like central carbon 
metabolism, iron metabolism is also closely implicated in autophagy-mediated 
life extension via the TORC2 activator Ypk1p and the iron regulator Aft1p. While 
not being an iron-sulfur cluster protein, Aft1p interacts with such proteins and 
thus senses the redox status of the cell, which, similar to amino acids and AMP, 
reports its energetic status. Furthermore, glucose and iron deficiencies are 
interrelated as the diauxic shift in glucose depleted cells requires iron uptake 
for activating respiration in the absence of fermentation.

The aim of this report was to introduce the use of modified dynamic 
high-frequency ultrasound-guided needle aponeurotomy for Dupuytren's 
contracture. From January 2014 to February 2019, the technique was used in 42 
consecutive patients who suffered from Dupuytren's contracture: 38 male and 4 
female; mean age, 57 years (range, 32-80 years). Assessments comprised total 
active extension deficit and total active flexion of the fingers, active range 
of motion, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, and EQ-5D 
index. Recurrence was defined as ≥20° flexion contracture. Compared to the 
opposite hand, preoperative total active extension deficit and total active 
flexion were 105° ± 32° and 221° ±  33°, respectively. The mean active range of 
motion of the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and distal 
interphalangeal joints was 42° ± 24°, 37° ± 26° and 62° ± 14°, respectively. 
Mean follow-up was 27 months (range, 24-35 months). There were no cases of 
tendon rupture or neurovascular injury. Total active extension deficit and total 
active flexion at the final follow-up were 17° ± 11° and 225° ± 32°, 
respectively. The mean active range of motion of metacarpophalangeal, proximal 
interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints was 73° ± 28°, 89° ± 24° and 
63° ± 16°, respectively. The pre- and post-operative DASH scores were 18 ± 10 
and 5 ± 2, respectively. Health-related quality of life on EQ-5D index improved 
from 0.72 ± 0.28 pre-operatively to 0.88 ± 0.72 post-operatively (p < 0.05). 
Recurrence rates in the metacarpophalangeal joint and proximal interphalangeal 
joint were 7% and 11%, respectively. The modified dynamic high-frequency 
ultrasound-guided needle aponeurotomy is a safe and effective way to treat 
Dupuytren's contractures. Ultrasound visualization ensures that the cords can be 
completely transected. Dynamic ultrasound decreases the risk of iatrogenic 
injury to the neurovascular bundles and tendons, and decreases the recurrence 
rate. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, level IV.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are 
heterogeneous neoplasms. Although some have a relatively benign and indolent 
natural history, others can be aggressive and ultimately fatal. Somatostatin 
analogues (SSAs) improve both quality of life and survival for these patients 
once they develop metastatic disease. However, these drugs are costly and their 
cost-effectiveness is not known.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed and analyzed to compare two 
treatment strategies for patients with Stage IV GEP-NETs. The first strategy had 
all patients start SSA immediately while the second strategy waited, reserving 
SSA initiation until the patient showed signs of progression. Sensitivity 
analysis was performed to explore model parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: Our model of patients age 60 with metastatic GEP-NETs suggests empiric 
initiation of SSA led to an increase 0.62 unadjusted life-years and incremental 
increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 0.44. The incremental costs 
were $388,966 per QALY and not cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold 
of $100,000. Death was attributed to GEP-NETs for 94.1% of patients in the SSA 
arm vs. 94.9% of patients in the DELAY SSA arm. Sensitivity analysis found that 
the model was most sensitive to costs of SSAs. Using probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, the SSA strategy was only cost-effective 1.4% of the time at a WTP 
threshold of $100,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Our modeling study finds it is not cost-effective to initiate SSAs 
at time of presentation for patients with metastatic GEP-NETs. Further clinical 
studies are needed to identify the optimal timing to initiate these drugs.

Although targeted therapies have increased the life expectancy of patients with 
druggable molecular alterations directly involved in tumor development, the 
efficacy of these therapies is limited by acquired resistances leading to 
treatment failure. Most targeted therapies, including ones exploiting 
therapeutic antibodies and kinase inhibitors, are directed against receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or major signaling hubs. Resistances to these therapies 
arise when inhibition of these targets is bypassed through activation of 
alternative signaling pathways. In recent years, activation of the receptor 
tyrosine kinase MET has been shown to promote resistance to various targeted 
therapies. This casts MET as important actor in resistance. In this review, we 
describe how the MET receptor triggers resistance to targeted therapies against 
RTKs such as EGFR, VEGFR, and HER2 and against signaling hubs such as BRAF. We 
also describe how MET can be its own resistance factor, as illustrated by 
on-target resistance of lung tumors harboring activating mutations causing MET 
exon 14 skipping. Interestingly, investigation of all these situations reveals 
functional physiological relationships between MET and the target of the therapy 
to which the cancer becomes resistant, suggesting that resistance stems from 
preexisting mechanisms. Identification of MET as a resistance factor opens the 
way to co-treatment strategies that are being tested in current clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Goals of care discussions (GOCD) are essential when counseling 
patients with cancer. Respective roles of radiation oncologists (RO) and medical 
oncologists (MO) in GOCD can be unclear. This study aims to clarify the dynamics 
and barriers to GOCD.
METHODS: Five hundred and fifty-four ROs and 1604 MOs at NCI-designated 
comprehensive cancer centers were sent an anonymous electronic survey regarding 
demographics, opinions, training in GOCD, GOCD frequency, and three vignettes. 
Response formats were Yes/No, Likert-type, and free response. Chi-square and 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed. Likert-type scores were reported as 
median [interquartile range].
RESULTS: There were 76 (13.7%) RO and 153 (9.5%) MO who completed surveys. 
Sixty-three percent of RO and 66% of MO reported GOCD with > 50% of patients 
(p = 0.90). GOCD were initiated for declining performance status (74%) and poor 
life expectancy (69%). More MO (42%) received formal GOCD training compared to 
RO (18%) (p < 0.01). MO were more comfortable conducting GOCD than RO 
(p < 0.01). RO-conducted GOCD were rated to be less important by MO compared to 
RO (p < 0.05). Thirty-six percent of MO reported being "not at all" or 
"somewhat" comfortable with RO-conducted GOCD. RO-initiated GOCD with new 
patients were rated less appropriate by RO compared to MO perceptions of 
RO-initiated GOCD (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: While MO and RO conduct GOCD with similar frequency, MO are more 
comfortable conducting GOCD and are more likely to have formal training. MO rate 
importance of RO involvement lower than RO. Further research is needed to 
understand interdisciplinary dynamics that may impact GOCD and subsequent 
patient care outcomes.

A homology model of Nav1.5, based mainly on the crystal structures of Nav1.2/1.5 
was built, optimized and successfully inserted into the membrane bilayer. We 
applied steered and free MD simulation protocols for the visualization of the 
mechanism of Nav1.5 activation. We constrained dihedrals of S4 trigger to 
introduce a structural tension with further rearrangement and movement of 
secondary structure elements. From these, we observed an intracellular gate 
opening and movement of the Lys1419 residue caused by a gradual displacement of 
the distal S6 α-helix with the extended S4 3-10 helix of voltage-sensing domains 
(VSD). A construction containing the Lys1419 residue in P-loop also changed its 
position due to the extension of this helix and subsequent induction of the 
pore-forming helixes motion. From this point, a double membrane system was 
generated, implying a free of ligand Nav1.5 protein and on the opposite side its 
copy containing a docked bupivacaine molecule inside the pore channel. The 
system can be used for the design of selective inhibitors against the Nav1.7 
channel, instead of mixed effect on both channels.

INTRODUCTION: Blood proteins are emerging as candidate biomarkers for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). We systematically profiled the plasma proteome to 
identify novel AD blood biomarkers and develop a high-performance, blood-based 
test for AD.
METHODS: We quantified 1160 plasma proteins in a Hong Kong Chinese cohort by 
high-throughput proximity extension assay and validated the results in an 
independent cohort. In subgroup analyses, plasma biomarkers for amyloid, tau, 
phosphorylated tau, and neurodegeneration were used as endophenotypes of AD.
RESULTS: We identified 429 proteins that were dysregulated in AD plasma. We 
selected 19 "hub proteins" representative of the AD plasma protein profile, 
which formed the basis of a scoring system that accurately classified clinical 
AD (area under the curve  = 0.9690-0.9816) and associated endophenotypes. 
Moreover, specific hub proteins exhibit disease stage-dependent dysregulation, 
which can delineate AD stages.
DISCUSSION: This study comprehensively profiled the AD plasma proteome and 
serves as a foundation for a high-performance, blood-based test for clinical AD 
screening and staging.

Rates of mental illness have increased dramatically over the past 15 years in 
the United States [Products-Data Briefs-Number 283-August 2017. Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db283.htm . Published August 15, 
2017]. Additionally, life expectancy has fallen over the past several years due 
to increases in death from suicide, opioid overdose, and alcoholic liver 
cirrhosis as reported by Case and Deaton [Deaths of despair and the future of 
capitalism. Princeton University Press, 2020]. Over the last decade some have 
questioned whether these changes are due to neoliberal capitalist policies and 
ideologies. Neoliberal capitalism incorporates theories of eliminating all 
restrictions on the market and decreasing government assistance programs as 
reported by Harvey [A brief history of neoliberalism, Oxford University Press, 
2005]. Since then these policies have led to income inequality, disempowerment 
of workers, outsourcing of manufacturing jobs, inadequate social services, mass 
incarceration and an expensive and ineffective healthcare system as reported by 
Case and Deaton [Deaths of despair and the future of capitalism. Princeton 
University Press, 2020] and Nkansah-Amankra et al. [International Journal of 
Health Services 43(2):217-240, 2013]. Studies have shown that the consequences 
of these policies and ideologies likely have a role in increasing rates of 
mental illness. This paper will discuss how these factors increase mental 
distress and postulate ways that mental health professionals can advocate for 
change.

American Indians and Alaska Natives, also known as Native Americans and 
Indigenous Americans, represent 574 federally recognized Indian Nations, also 
called First Nations and sometimes referred to as tribes. Each Nation is unique 
with its own history, culture, and spiritual and traditional practices. Through 
treaties and executive orders, American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Nations 
have been guaranteed a variety of services by the United States, including 
health care, education, and housing in exchange for tribal land and natural 
resources. Despite the legal obligation, inequitable social policies and 
practices, inadequate funding, and provider shortages have forced AIAN 
communities to face massive disparities in health. As a result, AIANs are 
disproportionately affected by chronic mental and physical health conditions 
compared to the general U.S. population, and they have the lowest life 
expectancy of any racial/ ethnic group in the U.S. It is important to address 
the barriers to adequate health and social care that have led to lower life 
expectancy rates and devasting disparities in health and health care delivery. 
This article will use a framework of structural competency to identify root 
causes of health disparities and discuss potential opportunities for targeted 
interventions to effectively and appropriately evaluate and treat AIAN patients.

American Indians (AI) and Alaska Natives (AN), descendants of the indigenous 
people, are a diverse population group growing in number every year. Studies 
have shown that American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have a decreased 
life expectancy, higher mortality rate, and lower quality of life than the 
general US population. In addition to having higher rates of general medical 
conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure, there is a high 
prevalence of mental health problems and psychiatric comorbidity amongst 
American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). A national study comparing the 
prevalence of mental health disorders and associated treatment-seeking results 
showed higher rates of psychiatric disorders in American Indians and Alaska 
natives than non-Hispanic whites.  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
violence, suicide, and substance use have been identified as some of the 
more prevalent mental health issues among AI/ANs when compared with the general 
population in the United States. Sociodemographic characteristics, including 
age, education, and income, are likely contributing factors for the number of 
psychiatric disorders seen in American Indians and Alaska Natives than other 
racial groups.  There should be an increased effort to improve AI/AN mental 
health care disparities through culturally competent clinical interventions. In 
working towards this goal, it is important to identify the existing disparities 
in mental health care delivery and outcomes among AI/ANs. This will then help 
guide the steps that are necessary for improved outcomes and reduction in health 
disparities.

According to the CDC, 1 in 4 Americans lives with a disability. This equates to 
approximately 61 million Americans. Disability, by nature, is a dynamic concept 
because it involves the relationship between the patient and their injury, 
physical environment, social atmosphere, economic factors, and religious 
beliefs. Patients can be affected in functions related to cognition through 
functions involved with living independently. Although 2 in 5 patients above the 
age of 65 have a disability, anyone can become disabled at any time in their 
life. The number of disabled persons is forecasted to be a rapidly growing 
statistic for several reasons. One reason is the incidence and prevalence of 
obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. The aforementioned chronic conditions are 
all risk factors for disability, and as a result of their increase, the 
incidence of disability will too increase.  Another reason is the increase in 
life expectancy due to advances in medicine and surgery. More people are 
surviving what would previously be considered a life-ending ailment. However, a 
common complication of surviving one of these previously life-ending ailments is 
residual limb deformity, chronic pain, and impaired mobility, to list a few. 
These complications can affect the way a person interacts with their 
environment, therefore, leading to disability. Disability has a continuously 
evolving definition and legal interpretation, as can be expected by the 
continuous change in socioeconomics and prevalence of chronic disease. When 
discussing disability, it is important to understand the terminology. Simply 
put, three main words: impairment, disability, and handicap. Impairment is 
essentially a dysfunction of a body system, such as an organ system or the 
musculoskeletal system. This can affect how a patient interacts with their home, 
social, or work environments and can often present as a lack of ability to do 
something. This is known as a disability. It is important to highlight that not 
all impairments lead to a disability. Disability can be further categorized into 
temporary or permanent and partial or total disability. Lastly, the term 
handicap relates the consequences of a disability for a patient to the community 
or social environment.  For example, a person with an above-the-knee amputation 
has difficulty walking long distances and therefore needs to park their vehicle 
close to the entrance. As a result of the continuous evolution of disablement, 
its conceptualization has evolved as well. There are three main paradigms 
through which disablement can be viewed and interpreted.  The medical paradigm 
is the original model for disability guidelines. The medical model focuses on 
the pathology causing the impairment. It seeks to relate organ dysfunction at 
the simplest level to physical dysfunction. The main problem with this 
interpretation is that not all organ or system dysfunction has a specific 
treatment, therapeutic endpoint, or clear-cut disability.  The social paradigm 
interprets the social and functional barriers associated with certain 
impairments. What special accommodations are required as a result? The benefit 
of this paradigm is that it allows people with a disabling impairment to become 
empowered and participate in society. The biopsychosocial paradigm is the 
preferred interpretation for disablement because it is multifaceted. The 
biological facet incorporates any mental or physical impairment. The 
psychological facet attempts to interpret the emotional state of the individual 
and take into account various personal and religious beliefs. The social facet 
addresses the environmental and infrastructural changes that are required to 
make the physical environment adaptable for patients with disabilities. The 
International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) 
currently adopts the biopsychosocial paradigm. The ICF is the current scheme for 
disability created by the World Health Organization, created in 2001. The ICF is 
a comprehensive outline that incorporates the confounding factors between 
disease state and impairment or, more simply put, between health and function. 
As eluded to earlier, there is a large legal component to disablement. The 
nature of the concept of disability is typically viewed in terms of ability to 
work and medical care costs. If someone is unable to work or participate in 
their environment because of a disability, they will need support from 
government services and legislation. In the United States, the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed in 1990. Simply put, this piece of legislation 
would guarantee Americans with disabilities the equal right to employment 
opportunities, transportation, and public access. The ADA defines disability as 
“a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the 
major life activities, a person who has a history or record of such impairment, 
or a person who is perceived by others as having such an impairment.”  The ADA 
is a massive piece of legislation, and so this article will only highlight the 
stipulations relating to employment. For further information on the ADA, please 
visit ada.gov. Employment is a major life activity, which in some instances can 
be life-sustaining. The ADA asks for reasonable accommodation of the employer 
unless it poses an undue hardship on the employer regarding cost or feasibility. 
If accommodation is provided, then there is no technical disability associated 
with a specific impairment in that specific environment. As mentioned before, 
not every impairment is a disability. For example, a soccer player with a 
transmetatarsal amputation may have to end his career and thus is disabled. 
Meanwhile, a computer technician with the same impairment may still be able to 
work and is therefore not disabled.  Determining the feasibility of reasonable 
accommodation is up to the employer. Understanding how impairment will affect a 
particular individual is important because it will dictate if and how 
compensation is received. There are several rating systems for both impairment 
and disability to standardize assessment. However, one common flaw to the system 
is that the impairment system is often used in lieu of the disability rating 
system due to the complexity of the process. Multiple compensation systems have 
their own criteria and definitions. This article will touch on some of the 
common disability systems before going into the rating schema. The Social 
Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Social Security Income (SSDI and 
SSI) are two parallel disability insurance systems dictated by federal 
government legislation.  SSDI is a system that provides benefits to persons who 
worked in a qualifying job for at least 5-10 years before the onset of the 
disability and became disabled before the age of 65. SSI, in contrast, provides 
income to individuals over the age of 65 or those who are blind or disabled. SSI 
does not require a work history.  The process to apply for SSI starts with the 
Disability Determination Service. Application for SSI can either be accepted or 
rejected. If the latter, then it can be resubmitted for reconsideration, and in 
some instances, there can be a court hearing. The industrial revolution inspired 
the Federal Workers’ Compensation Systems at the turn of the 20th century. As 
more people were employed by factories and worked in dangerous working 
conditions, the rate of disability or death resulting from work activities 
increased. As a result, a monetary compensation system was developed for 
individuals injured while at work or as a consequence of their employment. Some 
examples of the Federal Worker’s Compensation programs include Federal 
Employees’ Act, the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, Energy 
Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act, and The Federal Black Lung 
Program. Many state programs exist as well, and they all have similar 
fundamental features, which include: compulsory insurance required for all 
employers, a no-fault system for injuries or illness acquired at work or through 
the course of work, wage loss benefits, survivor benefits, compensation for 
permanent partial or permanent total disability, and many more with various 
stipulations associated. The Veterans Benefits Admiration offers disability for 
individuals and service members previously in full-time active military service 
and were discharged generally or honorably. There are three broad categories: 
(1) A service-connected disability, which is a disability that resulted from 
direct injury or disease while on active duty; (2) Nonservice-connected 
disability, which is due to an injury not incurred while on active duty; (3) 
Presumptive service connection which is a category that covers various chronic 
conditions that manifest within 1 year from discharge from active duty. The 
amount of compensation is related to the severity of impairment and disability 
endured and is not subject to state or federal income tax.  Personal injury 
claims are insurance provided to individuals who have injury arising out of 
negligence or intentional act. Personal injury claims typically arise from motor 
vehicle accidents, slip and fall claims, physical assault claims, and nursing 
home negligence.

BACKGROUND: Most long-term heavy drinkers do not have clinically evident chronic 
liver disease (CLD). However, at any time-point, their risk of developing CLD 
remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of a group of heavy 
drinkers, without evidence of CLD at baseline.
METHODS: A cohort of 123 long-term heavy drinkers without CLD were prospectively 
recruited in 2002 and retrospectively followed until 2018.
RESULTS: At baseline (2002), median alcohol consumption was 271±203g/day during 
21.5±20 years, 65% being abstinent during the previous 1.75±5 months. Patients 
were followed for 14±3 years. During follow-up, 53% reported any alcohol intake. 
Alcohol consumption during follow-up associated weakly with either 1- or 
6-months previous abstinence at baseline. Until 2018, progression to CLD 
occurred in 6%, associating with years of alcohol intake during follow-up (OR 
1.15 [1.01-1.31]) and baseline alkaline-phosphatase (OR 1.05 [1.01-1.10]). 
During follow-up, being abstinent for at least 1 year positively associated with 
CLD-free survival. 27% died (55% of cancer-mostly oropharyngeal cancer, 27% of 
cardiovascular disease, and 9% of liver disease), with a mean age of 71 years 
[69-74] (10 years less than the expected in the Portuguese population). 
Achieving abstinence for at least 1 year positively associated with overall 
survival, while smoking, and hepatic steatosis at baseline associated 
negatively.
CONCLUSION: Long-term heavy drinkers seemed to have a decreased life expectancy 
compared with the overall Portuguese population. Cancer was the main cause of 
death. Our results suggest that progression to CLD depends mostly on continued 
alcohol intake. Alcohol abstinence, even if temporary, seems to decrease the 
risks of CLD and mortality.

The outlook for those with cystic fibrosis (CF) has never been brighter with 
ever increasing life expectancy and the approval of the highly effective CFTR 
modulators, such as elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor. With that being said, the 
progressive pulmonary decline and importance of lung health, infection, and 
inflammation in CF remains. This review is the second part in a three-part CF 
Year in Review 2020. Part one focused on the literature related to CFTR 
modulators while part three will feature the multisystem effects related to CF. 
This review focuses on articles from Pediatric Pulmonology, including articles 
from other journals that are of particular interest to clinicians. Herein, we 
highlight studies published during 2020 related to CF pulmonary disease, 
infection, treatment, and diagnostics.

Increases in human life expectancy have led to increases in the prevalence of 
senile dementia and neurodegenerative diseases. This is a major problem because 
there are no curative treatments for these diseases, and patients with unmanaged 
cognitive and neurodegenerative symptoms experience many social problems. 
Sulforaphane is a type of organosulfur compound known as an isothiocyanate. It 
is derived from glucoraphanin, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables such 
as broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cabbages, via an enzymatic reaction that is 
triggered by plant damage (e.g., chewing). Sulforaphane exhibits activity 
against cancer, inflammation, depression, and severe cardiac diseases. It can 
also alleviate oxidative stress and neural dysfunction in the brain. However, 
there is insufficient knowledge about the electrophysiological and behavioral 
basis of the effects of sulforaphane on learning and memory. Therefore, we 
evaluated whether acute sulforaphane administration affected long-term 
potentiation (LTP) in organotypic cultured rat hippocampal tissues. We also 
measured the effect of sulforaphane on the performance of three behavioral 
tests, the Y-maze test, the passive avoidance test, and the Morris water maze, 
which assess short-term memory, avoidance memory, and short and long-term 
spatial memory, respectively. We found that sulforaphane increased the total 
field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in a dose-dependent manner after 
high frequency stimulation and attenuated scopolamine-induced interference of 
the fEPSP in the hippocampal CA1 area. Sulforaphane also restored cognitive 
function and inhibited memory impairment as indicated by the alleviation of the 
negative neurological effects of scopolamine, i.e, a lowered ratio of 
spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze, a reduced step-through latency in the 
passive avoidance test, and an increased navigation time in the Morris water 
maze. These results indicate that sulforaphane can effectively prevent the 
attenuation of LTP and cognitive abilities induced by cholinergic and muscarinic 
receptor blockade. Further research is warranted to explore the potential 
therapeutic and prophylactic utility of sulforaphane for improving learning and 
memory, especially in those suffering from neurodegenerative disorders.

A long-standing question in infection biology is why two very similar 
individuals, with very similar pathogen exposures, may have very different 
outcomes. Recent experiments have found that even isogenic Drosophila 
melanogaster hosts, given identical inoculations of some bacterial pathogens at 
suitable doses, can experience very similar initial bacteria proliferation but 
then diverge to either a lethal infection or a sustained chronic infection with 
much lower pathogen load. We hypothesized that divergent infection outcomes are 
a natural result of mutual negative feedbacks between pathogens and the host 
immune response. Here, we test this hypothesis in silico by constructing 
process-based dynamic models for bacterial population growth, host immune 
induction and the feedbacks between them, based on common mechanisms of immune 
system response. Mathematical analysis of a minimal conceptual model confirms 
our qualitative hypothesis that mutual negative feedbacks can magnify small 
differences among hosts into life-or-death differences in outcome. However, 
explaining observed features of chronic infections requires an extension of the 
model to include induced pathogen modifications that shield themselves from host 
immune responses at the cost of reduced proliferation rate. Our analysis thus 
generates new, testable predictions about the mechanisms underlying bimodal 
infection outcomes.

Emergent infectious diseases are one of the main drivers of species loss. 
Emergent infection with the microsporidian Nosema bombi has been implicated in 
the population and range declines of a suite of North American bumblebees, a 
group of important pollinators. Previous work has shown that phytochemicals 
found in pollen and nectar can negatively impact parasites in individuals, but 
how this relates to social epidemiology and by extension whether plants can be 
effectively used as pollinator disease management strategies remains unexplored. 
Here, we undertook a comprehensive screen of UK agri-environment scheme (AES) 
plants, a programme designed to benefit pollinators and wider biodiversity in 
agricultural settings, for phytochemicals in pollen and nectar using liquid 
chromatography and mass spectrometry. Caffeine, which occurs across a range of
