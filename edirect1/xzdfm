PURPOSE: Surgical options for long bone metastases include intramedullary nail 
fixation or prosthetic reconstruction. Patients with a short life expectancy may 
benefit from less invasive surgery such as intramedullary nail fixation, while 
patients with a long life expectancy could be treated with more invasive surgery 
such as prosthetic reconstruction. The purpose of our study was to analyze the 
survival of patients treated surgically for long bone metastases, determining 
the prognostic factors affecting survival and analyzing the surgical 
complications and reoperation rates. Based on our results, we developed a 
prognostic score that helps to choose the best treatment for these patients. In 
addition, we compared the performance of our prognostic score with other 
previous prognostic models.
METHOD: We investigated prospectively potential clinical and laboratory 
prognostic factors in 159 patients with metastatic bone disease who underwent 
surgery with intramedullary nail fixation or prosthetic reconstruction. Clinical 
data were collected, recording the following data: age and sex of patients, 
primary tumour and time of diagnosis, number (single or multiple) and 
presentation (synchronous or metachronous) of bone metastases, presence of 
visceral metastases. The following laboratory data were analyzed: hemoglobin, 
leukocyte counts, lymphocyte counts, platelets count, alkaline phosphatase, and 
C-reactive protein.
RESULTS: Our study showed that pathological C-reactive protein and primary 
tumour diagnosis were significant negative independent prognostic factors at 
12-month survival. Based on our results, we created a score using C-reactive 
protein and primary tumour diagnosis, creating three different prognostic 
groups: (A) good prognosis primary tumour and physiological CRP with probability 
of survival at 12 months of 88.9 [80.1-98.5]; (B) bad prognosis primary tumour 
and physiological CRP or good prognosis primary tumour and pathological CRP with 
a probability of survival at 12 months of 56.7 [45.4-70.7]; (C) bad prognosis 
primary tumour and pathological CRP with a probability of survival at 12 months 
of 12.5 [5.0-28.3]. Using ROC multiple analysis, our score (AUC = 0.816) was the 
most accurate in predicting a 12-month survival compared to previous prognostic 
models.
DISCUSSION: Patients treated surgically for long bone metastases with a life 
expectancy over 12 months should be treated with more durable reconstruction, 
while patients with a life expectancy less than 12 months should be treated with 
less invasive surgery. The diagnosis of primary cancer and C-reactive protein 
are two very simple data which every orthopaedic surgeon in any community 
hospital can easily rely on for any decision-making in the surgical treatment of 
a complex patient as with a patient with skeletal metastases.
CONCLUSION: Our prognostic score based on only two simple variables (C-reactive 
protein and primary tumour diagnosis) was able to predict the 12-month survival 
of patients treated surgically for long bone metastases and could be helpful in 
choosing the best treatment for these patients.

Phenanthrene (PHE) as a tricyclic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is one of the 
common pollutants in water and sediments, which can cause reproductive toxicity 
to aquatic organisms. In this study, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
was used to detect the vitellogenin (VTG) of loach, and then to explore the 
estrogenic toxicity effect of PHE on loach. The results were as follows: (1) 
with the increase of PHE concentrations and the extension of exposure time, the 
gonadosomatic index (GSI) of males decreased significantly, while it increased 
in female loaches. In addition, males had more obvious changes than females and 
were more sensitive to PHE. (2) The increase of VTG contents in serum of males 
were stronger than that in females. Those results reveal that PHE has estrogenic 
effect, which can affect the generation of VTG, thus causing damage to the gonad 
development of loach.

Brief interventions to reduce frequent alcohol use among persons with HIV (PWH) 
are evidence-based, but resource-constrained settings must contend with 
competition for health resources. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of two 
intervention arms compared to the standard of care (SOC) in a three-arm 
randomized control trial targeting frequent alcohol use in PWH through 
increasing the percent days abstinent from alcohol and viral suppression. We 
estimated incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a 
modified societal perspective and a 1-year time horizon using a Markov model of 
health outcomes. The two-session brief intervention (BI), relative to the 
six-session combined intervention (CoI), was more effective and less costly; the 
estimated incremental cost-effectiveness of the BI relative to the SOC, was $525 
per QALY gained. The BI may be cost-effective for the HIV treatment setting; the 
health utility gained from viral suppression requires further exploration.

PURPOSE: Determining life expectancy in patients with dementia are challenging. 
We aimed at studying the association between basic activities of daily living as 
measured by the Barthel Index at hospital admission and mortality among older 
patients with dementia.
METHODS: All patients aged ≥ 65 years with diagnosed dementia in the 
population-based National Danish Geriatric Database from 2005 to 2014 were 
included and followed until death, emigration, or study termination 
(31.12.2015). Data on Barthel Index (BI) were used to assess ADL. Patients were 
categorized into four predefined standard BI subcategories according to the 
national Danish version of the statistical classification of diseases [BI = 0-24 
(very low ADL), BI = 25-49 (low ADL), BI = 50-79 (moderate reduced ADL), and 
BI = 80-100 (independent ADL)]. Association with mortality was assessed using 
multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusting for age, marital status, 
Charlson Comorbidity Index, BMI, prior hospitalizations, year of admission and 
polypharmacy.
RESULTS: In total, 6550 patients (women 62%) were included, median (IQR) age 84 
(79-88) years and BI 37 (13-63). Mortality increased significantly with 
decreasing BI in both the crude and multivariable analysis. In subcategories 
BI = (80-100) and BI = (0-24), survival time (median (95%)) was 3.6 (3.4-3.9) 
years and 0.8 (0.7-0.9) years, respectively. Also, in patients with BI = (0-24), 
the overall mortality risk (HR (95% CI)) was 2.5 (2.2-2.8), 30-day risk 11.8 
(5.8-23.9), and 1-year risk 4.4 (3.6-5.5) when using BI = (80-100) as reference.
CONCLUSION: Barthel Index is independently associated with all-cause mortality 
among older patients with dementia admitted to hospital. BI may be a helpful 
tool for clinicians when discussing treatment and care strategies with patients 
and their families.

We analyzed the variation trend of growing season length (GSL) of different 
periods in provinces (regions) of China and the corresponding movement velocity 
of GSL isolines at 150, 200, 250, 300 and 350 days, based on daily mean 
temperature data of 822 meteorological stations from 1951 to 2017. In this 
study, the definition of GSL given by the world meteorological organization was 
adopted, together with Slope, Hurst and Mann-Kendall indices. The results showed 
that the GSL in northern China changed significantly during 1951-2017. The 
extension of GSL was faster in the north than the south, and faster in 
high-altitude areas than low-altitude ones. The trend of future GSL change in 
most regions of China converged with the current extension trend. The extension 
of GSL in northern provinces (regions) was generally 0.1-0.2 d·a-1, of which the 
fastest was Tibet with a speed of 0.44 d·a-1. The period 1981-2000 was the most 
changeable time of GSL in Chinese provinces (regions). The growing season start 
(GSS) of all provinces (regions) contributed more to the GSL extension, except 
for Xinjiang, whose GSL extension was dominated by the growing season end (GSE). 
In the high-latitude or high-altitude provinces, GSL was more sensitive to the 
change of mean annual temperature. The higher the mean annual temperature, the 
longer the GSL. Since 1951, China's GSL isolines of 150, 200, 250, 300 and 350 
days showed notable variations. The fastest movement velocity was the 200 days 
isoline in Northeast China with an average northward movement velocity of 6.11 
km·a-1. The general principle of the movement of China's GSL isoline was that 
the higher the value of the isoline, the slower the northward movement, with 
even a southward shift in part of the 350 days isoline. The extension of GSL in 
China would result in the northward shift of crop planting boundary and the 
extension of natural vegetation growth period. However, the specific impacts of 
this change on the quality, crop yield, and ecosystem carbon sequestration need 
further research.

基于822个气象站点1951—2017年的日均温度数据,采用世界气象组织给定的植被生长期(GSL)定义,利用Slope、Mann-Kendall和Hurst指数分析中国各省(区)不同时期的GSL变化趋势及相应时期150、200、250、300和350 
d的GSL等值线移动速度。结果表明: 
研究期间中国北方地区GSL变化显著。GSL增长速度表现为北方快于南方、高海拔快于低海拔。中国大部分地区未来GSL变化趋势与当前的变化趋势相同。北方绝大部分省(区)GSL增长速度在0.1~0.2 
d·a-1,西藏的增速最快,为0.44 
d·a-1。1981—2000年是中国各省(区)GSL变化最显著的时段。除新疆GSL延长是生长期终日(GSE)主导外,其他各省(区)GSL延长总体是生长期始日(GSS)占主导。在高纬度和高海拔省(区),GSL变化对年均温度的变化更敏感。年均温越高的省(区)GSL也普遍越长。1951年以来,中国150、200、250、300和350 
d的GSL等值线出现了明显移动,东北地区200 d等值线的移动速度最快,其平均北移速度为6.11 
km·a-1。中国GSL等值线总体移动规律为:等值线数值越大,北移速度越慢。其中,350 
d等值线在部分区段甚至出现了南移的情况。中国GSL延长将导致农作物种植边界北移,自然植被生长期延长。该变化对中国农作物的品质、产量和生态系统碳固定的影响还有待深入研究。.

OBJECTIVE: Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is a variant of endometrial 
cancer that is aggressive and associated with poor outcomes. We sought to 
evaluate the cost effectiveness of carboplatin/paclitaxel alone versus 
carboplatin/paclitaxel with trastuzumab among patients with Her2/neu-positive 
advanced or recurrent UPSC.
METHODS: We designed a Markov model in TreeAge Pro 2019 software to simulate 
management of a theoretical cohort of 4000 patients with Her2/neu-positive 
advanced or recurrent uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) followed for 
four years. In the carboplatin/paclitaxel with trastuzumab strategy, we included 
the cost of testing for Her2/neu status. We obtained all model inputs from the 
literature and a societal perspective was assumed. Outcomes included 
progression-free survival, progression, UPSC-specific mortality, cost, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The intervention was considered cost 
effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was below the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were 
used to determine the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: In our theoretical cohort of 4000 women, treatment with the addition of 
trastuzumab resulted in 637 fewer deaths and 627 fewer cases of progression 
compared with treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel alone. Treatment with 
trastuzumab was associated with an additional cost of $144,335,895, but was 
associated with an increase of 2065 QALYs. The ICER was $69,903 per QALY, which 
was below our willingness-to-pay threshold. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated 
that this treatment strategy was cost-effective until the cost of 6 months of 
treatment surpassed $38,505 (baseline input: $27,562).
CONCLUSION: We found that the addition of trastuzumab to carboplatin/paclitaxel 
was a cost-effective treatment strategy for patients with advanced/recurrent 
Her2/neu-positive UPSC.

As advances in oncology therapies lead to significant improvement in life 
expectancy of many cancer entities, short-, and long-term cardiac side effects 
of oncology treatments gain increasing importance. In search of new screening 
modalities, echocardiography currently presents the best established and 
clinically easily feasible tool to detect cardiotoxicity in patients undergoing 
cancer therapy. This review focusses on the most commonly used oncology 
therapies and aims to give a practical approach to guide clinicians caring for 
this growing number of patients.

Background: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) approach estimates disease burden 
by combining fatal (years of life lost) and non-fatal burden prevalence-based 
years of life lived with disability (PYLDs) estimates. Although South Africa has 
data to estimate mortality, prevalence data to estimate non-fatal burden are 
sparse. PYLD estimates from the GBD study for South Africa can potentially be 
used. However, there is a divergence in mortality estimates for South Africa 
between the second South African National Burden of Disease (SANBD2) and 2013 
GBD studies. Objective: We investigated the feasibility of utilising GBD PYLD 
estimates for stroke and diabetes by exploring different disease modelling 
scenarios. Method: DisMod II software-generated South African stroke and 
diabetes PYLDs for 2010 from models using local epidemiological parameters and 
demographic data for people 20-79 years old. We investigated the impact on PYLD 
estimates of 1) differences in the cause-of-death envelope, 2) differences in 
the cause-specific mortality estimates (increase/decrease by 15% for stroke and 
30% for diabetes), and 3) difference using local disease parameters compared to 
other country or region parameters. Differences were expressed as ratios, 
average ratios and ratio ranges. Results: Using the GBD cause-of-death envelope 
(16% more deaths than SANBD2) and holding other parameters constant yielded 
age-specific ratios of PYLDs for stroke and diabetes ranging between 0.89 and 
1.07 (average 0.98) for males. Similar results were observed for females. A 15% 
change in age-specific stroke mortality showed little difference in the ratio 
comparison of PYLDs (range 0.98-1.02) while a 30% change in age-specific 
diabetes mortality resulted in a ratio range of 0.96-1.07 for PYLDs depending on 
age. Conclusion: This study showed that GBD non-fatal burden estimates (PYLDs) 
can be used for stroke and diabetes non-fatal burden in the SANBD2 study.

Microtubules (MTs) are regulated by a number of known posttranslational 
modifications (PTMs) on α/β-tubulin to fulfill diverse cellular functions. Here, 
we showed that SUMOylation is a novel PTM on α-tubulin in vivo and in vitro. The 
SUMOylation on α-tubulin mainly occurred at Lys 96 (K96), K166, and K304 of 
soluble α-tubulin and could be removed by small ubiquitin-related modifier 
(SUMO)-specific peptidase 1. In vitro experiments showed that tubulin 
SUMOylation could reduce interprotofilament interaction, promote MT catastrophe, 
and impede MT polymerization. In cells, mutation of the SUMOylation sites on 
α-tubulin reduced catastrophe frequency and increased the proportion of 
polymerized α-tubulin, while upregulation of SUMOylation with fusion of SUMO1 
reduced α-tubulin assembly into MTs. Additionally, overexpression of 
SUMOylation-deficient α-tubulin attenuated the neurite extension in Neuro-2a 
cells. Thus, SUMOylation on α-tubulin represents a new player in the regulation 
of MT properties.

Kochanek KD, Xu J, Arias E.

This report presents final 2019 U.S. mortality data on deaths and death rates by 
demographic and medical characteristics. These data provide information on 
mortality patterns among U.S. residents by variables such as sex, age, race and 
Hispanic origin, and cause of death. Life expectancy estimates, agespecific 
death rates, 10 leading causes of death, and 10 leading causes of infant death 
were analyzed by comparing 2019 and 2018 final data (1).

BACKGROUND: Many older adults with limited life expectancy still receive cancer 
screening. One potential contributor is that primary care providers (PCP) are 
not trained to incorporate life expectancy in cancer screening recommendations. 
We describe the development and evaluation of a novel curriculum to address this 
need.
METHODS: We developed and implemented a web-based learning module within a large 
Maryland group practice with PCPs for older adults. We assessed attitude, 
knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-reported behavior outcomes before the module, 
immediately after completing the module, and 6 months afterwards.
RESULTS: Of 172 PCPs who were invited, 86 (50%) completed the module and of 
these, 50 (58.1%) completed the 6-months follow up survey. Immediately after the 
module, there was a significant increase in perceived importance of life 
expectancy (increase of 0.50 point on 10-point scale, 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) = 0.27-0.73), confidence in predicting life expectancy (increase of 2.32 
points on 10-point scale, 95% CI = 1.95-2.70) and confidence in discussion 
screening cessation (increase of 1.69 points on 10-point scale, 95% CI = 
1.37-2.02). Knowledge in patient-preferred communication strategies improved 
from 55% correct response to 97% (P < .001). However, most of these improvements 
dissipated by 6 months and there was no change in self-reported behavior at 6 
months compared to baseline (P = .34).
CONCLUSION: Although the module resulted in significant short-term improvement 
in attitude, knowledge, and self-efficacy, the changes were not sustained over 
time. Educational interventions such as this can be coupled with ongoing 
reinforcing strategies and/or decision support interventions to improve 
cancer-screening practices in older adults.

INTRODUCTION: Cognitive deficits and metabolic disturbances are among the main 
determinants of functional impairment and reduced life expectancy in patients 
with schizophrenia, and they may share underlying biological mechanisms. Among 
these, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a key mediator of inflammatory response, is of 
particular interest. IL-1β C-511T polymorphism has been associated with 
neuropsychiatric conditions and, in the general population, with cognitive and 
metabolic alterations. This study aims to evaluate the effects of the IL-1β 
C-511T polymorphism on both cognition and metabolic syndrome in a sample of 
patients affected by schizophrenia, with a focus on sex differences.
METHODS: 138 patients with schizophrenia were assessed for metabolic parameters 
and neurocognitive measures by means of the Brief Assessment of Cognition Scale. 
The effects of IL-1β C-511T polymorphism on cognition and metabolic syndrome 
were evaluated in the context of general linear models.
RESULTS: The analysis showed a significant interaction between IL-1β genotype 
and sex on 2 core cognitive domains. In detail, among CC homozygous, females 
outperformed males on processing speed, while among T carriers, males 
outperformed females on executive functions. A significant interaction also 
emerged between metabolic syndrome, sex, and IL-1β genotype for executive 
functions, with worse performance for T carrier females with metabolic syndrome. 
No significant direct effect was observed for metabolic syndrome on cognition.
CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that IL-1β polymorphism could 
play a key role in mediating the complex and refined relationship between 
metabolic syndrome and cognitive performance.

The respiratory epithelium can be affected by many diseases that could be 
treated using aerosol gene therapy. Among these, cystic fibrosis (CF) is a 
lethal inherited disease characterized by airways complications, which determine 
the life expectancy and the effectiveness of aerosolized treatments. Beside 
evaluations performed under in vivo settings, cell culture models mimicking in 
vivo pathophysiological conditions can provide complementary insights into the 
potential of gene transfer strategies. Such models must consider multiple 
parameters, following the rationale that proper gene transfer evaluations depend 
on whether they are performed under experimental conditions close to 
pathophysiological settings. In addition, the mucus layer, which covers the 
epithelial cells, constitutes a physical barrier for gene delivery, especially 
in diseases such as CF. Artificial mucus models featuring physical and 
biological properties similar to CF mucus allow determining the ability of gene 
transfer systems to effectively reach the underlying epithelium. In this review, 
we describe mucus and cellular models relevant for CF aerosol gene therapy, with 
a particular emphasis on mucus rheology. We strongly believe that combining 
multiple pathophysiological features in single complex cell culture models could 
help bridge the gaps between in vitro and in vivo settings, as well as viral and 
non-viral gene delivery strategies.

Ambient fine particulate matter <2.5 µm (PM2.5) air pollution increases 
premature mortality globally. Some PM2.5 is natural, but anthropogenic PM2.5 is 
comparatively avoidable. We determined the impact of long-term exposures to the 
anthropogenic PM component on mortality in Australia. PM2.5-attributable deaths 
were calculated for all Australian Statistical Area 2 (SA2; n = 2310) regions. 
All-cause death rates from Australian mortality and population databases were 
combined with annual anthropogenic PM2.5 exposures for the years 2006-2016. 
Relative risk estimates were derived from the literature. Population-weighted 
average PM2.5 concentrations were estimated in each SA2 using a satellite and 
land use regression model for Australia. PM2.5-attributable mortality was 
calculated using a health-impact assessment methodology with life tables and 
all-cause death rates. The changes in life expectancy (LE) from birth, years of 
life lost (YLL), and economic cost of lost life years were calculated using the 
2019 value of a statistical life. Nationally, long-term population-weighted 
average total and anthropogenic PM2.5 concentrations were 6.5 µg/m3 (min 1.2-max 
14.2) and 3.2 µg/m3 (min 0-max 9.5), respectively. Annually, anthropogenic 
PM2.5-pollution is associated with 2616 (95% confidence intervals 1712, 3455) 
deaths, corresponding to a 0.2-year (95% CI 0.14, 0.28) reduction in LE for 
children aged 0-4 years, 38,962 (95%CI 25,391, 51,669) YLL and an average annual 
economic burden of $6.2 billion (95%CI $4.0 billion, $8.1 billion). We conclude 
that the anthropogenic PM2.5-related costs of mortality in Australia are higher 
than community standards should allow, and reductions in emissions are 
recommended to achieve avoidable mortality.

Background: Ulcerative colitis is a disease with an unpredictable evolution, 
often highlighted endoscopically, that is associated with persistent 
inflammation affecting the patient's quality of life. An attempt was made to 
discover surrogate markers to evaluate the endoscopic remission of the disease 
in order to increase the patient's quality of life and also their adherence to 
the treatment and monitoring plan. One such marker is fecal calprotectin (FC). 
Aims: To confirm the correlation between biomarkers and endoscopic disease 
activity and to define the optimal cut off value to detect clinical and 
endoscopic remission in a center of Romania. Methods: This was a prospective 
study that included 59 patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at the 
Department of Internal Medicine III, University Emergency Hospital of Bucharest. 
Patients had fecal calprotectin measurements and colonoscopy/rectosigmoidoscopy 
performed during baseline, 6 and 12 months. For endoscopic activity the 
Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) was used. Results: 
During the study, relapses have occurred in 35.6% of patients, the median age 
was 47 years (21-77). During the study, the FC measurement was significantly 
increased at 3 months (median, range µg/g; 715, 14-4000) and at 6 months 
(median, range µg/g; 650, 4.5-3000) (p ≤ 0.05). Another inflammatory biomarker 
studied was CRP, which showed increased values at 3 months (median, range, 
mg/dL; 1.86, 0.14-58.9), at 6 months (median, range, mg/dL; 2.36, 0.12-45.8) and 
at 9 months (median, range, mg/dl; 2, 0.12-25.9) compared to the baseline (p = 
0.01). Patients with recurrence of the disease also associated an increase in 
the values of clinical evaluation scores (SCCAI; p = 0.00001), but also 
endoscopic (UCEIS; p = 0.0006) Conclusion: A relapse is associated independently 
with younger age, the extension of the disease (E2-E3), increased FC level, C 
reactive protein, hemoglobin concentration, SCCAI index and UCEIS score.

The incidence of brain pathologies has increased during last decades. Better 
diagnosis (autism spectrum disorders) and longer life expectancy (Parkinson's 
disease, Alzheimer's disease) partly explain this increase, while emerging data 
suggest pollutant exposures as a possible but still underestimated cause of 
major brain disorders. Taking into account that the brain parenchyma is rich in 
gap junctions and that most pollutants inhibit their function; brain disorders 
might be the consequence of gap-junctional alterations due to long-term 
exposures to pollutants. In this article, this hypothesis is addressed through 
three complementary aspects: (1) the gap-junctional organization and connexin 
expression in brain parenchyma and their function; (2) the effect of major 
pollutants (pesticides, bisphenol A, phthalates, heavy metals, airborne 
particles, etc.) on gap-junctional and connexin functions; (3) a description of 
the major brain disorders categorized as neurodevelopmental (autism spectrum 
disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, epilepsy), neurobehavioral 
(migraines, major depressive disorders), neurodegenerative (Parkinson's and 
Alzheimer's diseases) and cancers (glioma), in which both connexin dysfunction 
and pollutant involvement have been described. Based on these different aspects, 
the possible involvement of pollutant-inhibited gap junctions in brain disorders 
is discussed for prenatal and postnatal exposures.

The present study examined the role of optimism, as measured by the Life 
Orientation Test-Revised, and coping styles, as measured by the COPE scale, in 
predicting negative affective conditions (viz., depressive symptoms, stress, and 
negative affect) among 386 Asian Indian young adults (197 females and 189 
males). Results from our hierarchical regression analyses indicated that coping 
styles accounted for a medium-large amount of variance in negative affective 
conditions, after controlling for demographic factors (i.e. age, gender, 
parent's education, and monthly income). Five coping styles were significant in 
predicting negative affective conditions across all three indices; mental 
disengagement, denial, and venting emotions were found to be maladaptive, while 
positive reinterpretation and humor were found to be adaptive among Asian Indian 
young adults. Furthermore, when optimism was included in the prediction model, 
optimism consistently accounted for additional variance in negative affective 
conditions, beyond coping styles. Due to the additional variance among negative 
affective conditions accounted for by optimism when compared to coping, we 
advise that mental health professionals consider prioritizing the reinforcement 
of positive expectancy in addition to enhancing adaptive coping styles and 
reducing the use of maladaptive coping among Asian Indians.

The Effect of Mianserin on Lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegan is Abolished by 
Glucose.

La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.

BACKGROUND: The antidepressant Mianserin has been shown to extend the lifespan 
of Caenorhabditis elegan (C. elegan), a well-established model organism used in 
ageing research. The extension of lifespan in C. elegan was shown to be 
dependent on increased expression of the scaffolding protein (ANK3/unc-44). In 
contrast, antidepressant use in humans is associated with an increased risk of 
death. The C. elegan elegan in the laboratory are fed Escherichia coli (E. 
coli), a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrate, whereas a typical human 
diet is high in carbohydrates. We hypothesized that dietary carbohydrates might 
mitigate the lifespan-extension effect of mianserin.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of glucose added to the diet of C. elegan 
on the lifespan-extension effect of mianserin.
METHODS: Wild-type Bristol N2 and ANK3/unc-44 inactivating mutants were cultured 
on agar plates containing nematode growth medium and fed E. coli. Treatment 
groups included (C) control, (M50) 50 μM mianserin, (G) 73 mM glucose, and 
(M50G) 50 μM mianserin and 73 mM glucose. Lifespan was determined by monitoring 
the worms until they died. Statistical analysis was performed using the 
Kaplan-Meier version of the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Mianserin treatment resulted in a 12% increase in lifespan (P<0.05) of 
wild-type Bristol N2 worms but reduced lifespan by 6% in ANK3/unc-44 mutants, 
consistent with previous research. The addition of glucose to the diet reduced 
the lifespan of both strains of worms and abolished the lifespan-extension by 
mianserin.
CONCLUSION: The addition of glucose to the diet of C. elegan abolishes the 
lifespan-extension effects of mianserin.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 
(EHEC) utilize a macromolecular type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject 
effector proteins into eukaryotic cells. This apparatus spans the inner and 
outer bacterial membranes and includes a helical needle protruding into the 
extracellular space. Thus far observed only in EPEC and EHEC and not found in 
other pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria that have a T3SS is an additional 
helical filament made by the EspA protein that forms a long extension to the 
needle, mediating both attachment to eukaryotic cells and transport of effector 
proteins through the intestinal mucus layer. Here, we present the structure of 
the EspA filament from EPEC at 3.4 Å resolution. The structure reveals that the 
EspA filament is a right-handed 1-start helical assembly with a conserved lumen 
architecture with respect to the needle to ensure the seamless transport of 
unfolded cargos en route to the target cell. This functional conservation is 
despite the fact that there is little apparent overall conservation at the level 
of sequence or structure with the needle. We also unveil the molecular details 
of the immunodominant EspA epitope that can now be exploited for the rational 
design of epitope display systems.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe hereditary blood disorder caused by a 
mutation of the beta-globin gene, which results in a substantial reduction in 
life expectancy. Many studies are focused on various novel therapeutic 
strategies that include re-activation of the γ-globin gene. Among them, 
expression therapy caused by the fetal hemoglobin (HbF) at a later age is highly 
successful. The induction of HbF is one of the dominant genetic modulators of 
the hematological and clinical characteristics of SCD. In fact, HbF compensates 
for the abnormal beta chain and has an ameliorant effect on clinical 
complications. Erythropoiesis is a multi-step process that involves the 
proliferation and differentiation of a small population of hematopoietic stem 
cells and is affected by several factors, including signaling pathways, 
transcription factors, and small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs play a 
regulatory role through complex networks that control several epigenetic 
mechanisms as well as the post-transcriptional regulation of multiple genes. In 
this review, we briefly describe the current understanding of interactions 
between miRNAs, their molecular targets, and their regulatory effects in HbF 
induction in SCD.

Cementless Fixation in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty: Historical Perspective 
to Contemporary Application.

Cleveland, OH (Kamath, Siddiqi, Krebs), and the Department of Orthopedic 
Surgery, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY (Malkani).

Cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been considered the benchmark, with 
excellent clinical outcomes and low rates of aseptic loosening at the long-term 
follow-up. However, alterations of the bone/cement interface leading to aseptic 
loosening, particularly in younger and obese patients, along with increased life 
expectancy have led to a renewed interest in noncemented TKA fixation. Certain 
early noncemented designs exhibited higher rates of subsidence and component 
failure. Improvements in designs, materials, and surgical technique offer 
promise for improved results with contemporary noncemented TKA applications. In 
an increasing cost-conscious healthcare environment, implant cost is important 
to consider because press-fit prostheses are generally more expensive. However, 
this cost may be offset by shorter surgical times, cement costs, and the 
potential for osseous integration. Technological advances have improved the 
manufacturing of porous metals, with reported excellent midterm survivorship. 
Future prospective, randomized trials, and registry data are needed to delineate 
differences between cemented and noncemented fixation, survivorship, and 
patient-reported outcomes, especially in young, functionally active, and/or 
obese populations.

BACKGROUND: Higher life expectancy in the general population entails a growing 
interest in the surgical management of diseases affecting elderly patients. 
Preoperative assessment when planning surgery needs to carefully evaluate
