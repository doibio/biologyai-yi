IMPORTANCE: Cardiovascular disease and risk factors represent a major and 
increasing burden of death and disability in India, although socioeconomic 
aspects have been debated in recent years.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive equity analysis of the socioeconomic 
gradients and distribution of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in India using 
the latest national data set.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of data originating 
from the fourth Indian National Family Health Survey collected from January 20, 
2015, to December 4, 2016. The study population was based on a nationally 
representative cross-sectional sample of women aged 15 to 49 years and men aged 
15 to 54 years in India, with a response rate of 97% and 92% among eligible 
women and men, respectively. Biomarker sampling of survey respondents captured 
height, weight, blood pressure, and random blood glucose levels. Markers of 
socioeconomic status (SES) were household wealth, education, and social caste. 
Descriptive analyses and logistic regression models that account for multistage 
survey design and sampling weights were estimated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity assessed by 
predetermined thresholds based on biomarker sampling or current medication were 
the primary outcomes.
RESULTS: The survey covered 757 958 individuals (weighted prevalence of 51.2% 
female). The overall prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in the 
sample was 2.9%, 14.4% and 9.7%, respectively. Positive socioeconomic gradients 
were observed by household wealth, education, and social caste, and in a 
majority of states. The magnitude of the SES gradient was strongest for obesity 
(adjusted odds ratio for highest SES quintile vs lowest, 8.76; 95% CI, 
7.70-9.95), followed by diabetes (adjusted odds ratio, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.88-2.85) 
and hypertension (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.45-1.72) (P < .001 for 
all associations). Analyses of the socioeconomic distribution indicated that 
between 70% and 90% of the population burden of diabetes, hypertension, and 
obesity was among the higher SES groups, and this figure was similar across 
states.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular risk factors have an uneven 
distribution in India. Prevention and treatment strategies should reflect the 
distribution of the risk factor burden.

BACKGROUND: Gamete cryopreservation causes cellular damage and death. This study 
develops cryopreservation techniques for Levantine scraper, and deciphers how 
early offspring development is affected when eggs are sired with fresh and 
frozen-thawed sperm.
RESULTS: Cryopreserved sperm did not affect embryogenesis at two- and four-cell 
stages, but impaired embryonic development at eight-cell stage. Embryonic 
viability decreased at organogenesis, where only 34-49% of embryos showed 
viability with frozen-thawed sperm. Hatching success and percentage of normal 
hatched embryos declined when fertilized with frozen-thawed sperm. Considering 
only frozen-thawed cells the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-5%, methanol (METH)-5%, 
and METH-10% treatments yielded highest hatch, while METH-5% and propylene 
glycol-5% yielded the most normal hatched embryos. Larval spinal torsion was 
higher for fresh than frozen-thawed sperm, where larvae with spinal torsion 
showed vertebral fusion and shape alterations during exogenous feeding. Both 
fresh and cryopreserved treatments showed abnormalities in caudal skeleton, 
while rates of defective yolk-sacs were higher for cryopreserved sperm, where 
larvae with defective yolks showed oversized yolk extension. Percentage of 
larvae with defective heads/eyes were also higher for cryopreserved sperm.
CONCLUSIONS: Results show how frozen-thawed sperm impairs embryonic/larvae 
development and identifies frequency and position of abnormalities. Future 
studies should investigate how sperm DNA damage may have caused these 
alterations.

BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder is a chronic, debilitating, and costly disorder 
that has increased in prevalence in many countries, with an associated sharp 
rise in mortality. Maintenance opioid agonist therapy is the first-line 
treatment, but many patients do not stop using illicit or non-prescribed drugs 
concomitantly. We aimed to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a 
personalised psychosocial intervention implemented with a toolkit of 
behaviour-change techniques as an adjunct to opioid agonist therapy.
METHODS: We did a pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial at a 
specialist UK National Health Service community addictions clinic in London, UK. 
Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, met criteria for opioid or 
cocaine dependence, or both, in the past 12 months, and voluntarily sought 
continued oral maintenance opioid agonist therapy, which they had been 
prescribed for at least 6 weeks. All participants were treatment resistant (ie, 
had used illicit or non-prescribed opioids or cocaine on one or more days in the 
past 28 days at study screening, which was verified by positive urine drug 
screen). Participants were allocated (1:1) by a web-accessed randomisation 
sequence (stratified by opioid agonist medication, current cocaine use, and 
current rug use) to receive a personalised psychosocial intervention (comprising 
a flexible toolkit of psychological-change methods, including contingency 
management to reinforce abstinence, recovery activities, and clinic attendance) 
in addition to treatment as usual, or treatment as usual only (control group). 
The primary outcome was treatment response at 18 weeks, which was defined as 
abstinence from illicit and non-prescribed opioids and cocaine in the past 28 
days, as measured with treatment outcomes profiles and urine drug screening. 
Taking a societal cost perspective, we did an evaluation of cost-effectiveness 
with a wide range of willingness-to-pay values for a unit improvement in the 
probability of treatment response. We also calculated quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). Efficacy was analysed in a modified-intention-to-treat 
population, including all participants who were randomly allocated but excluding 
those who had previously completed the intervention. This trial is registered 
with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN69313751. The trial is completed.
FINDINGS: Between June 7, 2013, and Dec 21, 2015, we randomly allocated 136 
participants to the psychosocial intervention group and 137 to the control 
group. The trial database was locked on April 19, 2017. Three patients (one in 
the psychosocial intervention group and two in the control group) who were 
re-randomised in error were excluded from the analysis. 22 (16%) of 135 patients 
in the psychosocial intervention group had a treatment response, compared with 
nine (7%) of 135 in the control group (adjusted log odds 1·20 [95% CI 
0·01-2·37]; p=0·048). The psychosocial intervention had a higher probability of 
being cost-effective than treatment as usual. There was a probability range of 
47-87% for willingness-to-pay thresholds of £0-1000 for a unit improvement in 
the probability of treatment response. QALYs were higher in the psychosocial 
intervention group than in the control group (mean difference 0·048 [95% CI 
0·016-0·080]; p=0·004) in adjusted analyses, with 60% and 67% probabilities of 
cost-effectiveness at the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's 
willingness-to-pay thresholds of £20 000 and £30 000 per QALY, respectively. The 
number of adverse events was similar between groups, and no severe adverse 
events in either group were judged to be treatment related. One participant in 
the control group was hospitalised with drug-injection-related sepsis and died.
INTERPRETATION: In maintenance opioid agonist therapy, an adjunctive 
personalised psychosocial intervention in addition to standard therapy was 
efficacious and cost-effective compared with standard therapy alone at helping 
treatment-resistant patients abstain from using illicit and non-prescribed 
opioids and cocaine.

Extending life by delaying the aging process has been proven to be the most 
effective way to fight multiple chronic diseases in elderly adults. Evidence 
suggests that longevity is inversely related to unsaturation of membrane 
phospholipids. This study investigated how different unsaturated dietary fats 
affect life span and cause of death in male Wistar rats fed diets based on 
virgin olive oil (V), sunflower oil (S), or fish oil (F), which were 
supplemented or not with Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Previous results suggest that 
individual longevity and survival probability at different ages may be modulated 
by an appropriate dietary fat treatment. Lifelong feeding with V or F diets 
would reduce death probability compared to feeding with S diet at certain ages, 
although the effects of V diet would be maintained for most of life. 
Furthermore, the addition of lower amounts of CoQ10 reduced mortality associated 
with S diet, but CoQ10 had no effect on survival when combined with virgin olive 
oil or fish oil. Supplementation with low doses of CoQ10 failed to increase the 
maximum life span potential of rats fed a V or F diet. No clear evidence showing 
that monounsaturated fatty acids, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, or CoQ10 
exerted the observed effects by modulating the rate of aging has been found.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we used phenotypic and genetic analysis to 
investigate Double haploid (DH) lines derived from normal corn parents (HF1 and 
11S6169). DH technology offers an array of advantages in maize genetics and 
breeding as follows: first, it significantly shortens the breeding cycle by 
development of completely homozygous lines in two or three generations; and 
second, it simplifies logistics, including requiring less time, labor, and 
financial resources for developing new DH lines compared with the conventional 
RIL population development process.
OBJECTIVES: In our study, we constructed a maize genetic linkage map using SSR 
markers and a DH population derived from a cross of normal corn (HF1) and normal 
corn (11S6169).
METHODS: The DH population used in this study was developed by the following 
methods: we crossed normal corn (HF1) and normal corn (11S6169), which are 
parent lines of a normal corn cultivar, in 2014; and the next year, the F1 
hybrids were crossed with a tropicalized haploid inducer line (TAIL), which is 
homozygous for the dominant marker gene R1-nj (Nanda and Chase in Crop Sci 
6:213-215, 1966), and we harvested seeds of the haploid lines.
RESULTS: A total of 200 SSR markers were assigned to 10 linkage groups that 
spanned 1145.4 cM with an average genetic distance between markers of 5.7 cM. 68 
SSR markers showed Mendelian segregation ratios in the DH population at a 5% 
significance threshold. A total of 15 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for plant 
height (PH), ear height (EH), ear height ratio (ER), leaf length (LL), ear 
length (EL), set ear length (SEL), set ear ratio (SER), ear width (EW), 100 
kernel weight (100 KW), and cob color (CC) were found in the 121 lines in the DH 
population.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study may help to improve the detection and 
characterization of agronomic traits and provide great opportunities for maize 
breeders and researchers using a DH population in maize breeding programs.

OBJECTIVE: To provide estimates of the global incidence, mortality and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with testicular cancer (TCa) 
between 1990 and 2016, using findings from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
2016 study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the GBD 2016 study, cancer registry data and a vital 
registration system were used to estimate TCa mortality. Mortality to incidence 
ratios were used to transform mortality estimates to incidence, and to estimate 
survival, which was then used to estimate 10-year prevalence. Prevalence was 
weighted using disability weights to estimate years lived with disability 
(YLDs). Age-specific mortality and a reference life expectancy were used to 
estimate years of life lost (YLLs). DALYs are the sum of YLDs and YLLs.
RESULTS: Global incidence of TCa showed a 1.80-fold increase from 37 231 (95% 
uncertainty interval [ UI] 36 116-38 515) in 1990 to 66 833 (95% UI 
64 487-69 736) new cases in 2016. The age-standardized incidence rate also 
increased from 1.5 (95% UI 1.45-1.55) to 1.75 (95% UI 1.69-1.83) cases per 
100 000. Deaths from TCa remained stable between 1990 and 2016 [1990: 8394 (95% 
UI 7980-8904), 2016: 8651 (95% UI 8292-9027)]. The TCa age-standardized death 
rate decreased between 1990 and 2016, from 0.39 (95% UI 0.37-0.41) to 0.25 (95% 
UI 0.24-0.26) per 100 000; however, the decreasing trend was not similar in all 
regions. Global TCa DALYs decreased by 2% and reached 391 816 (95% UI 
372 360-412 031) DALYs in 2016. The age-standardized DALY rate also decreased 
globally between 1990 and 2016 (10.31 [95% UI 9.82-10.84]) per 100 000 in 2016).
CONCLUSION: Although the mortality rate for TCa has decreased over recent 
decades, large disparities still exist in TCa mortality, probably as a result of 
lack of access to healthcare and oncological treatment. Timely diagnosis of this 
cancer, by improving general awareness, should be prioritized. In addition, 
improving access to effective therapies and trained healthcare workforces in 
developing and under-developed areas could be the next milestones.

AIM: HIV-1 Nef downregulates surface MHC-I to protect the infected cells from 
CTLs-mediated killing. Although MHC-I downregulation has been extensively 
studied, the Nef-dependent assembly of the multi-protein complex and subsequent 
pathways activation has not yet been well explored. The present study is aimed 
for the identification of Nef-mediated sequential recruitment of cellular 
proteins that constitute the functional multi-protein complex, required for the 
downregulation of MHC-I.
MAIN METHODS: Different Cellular protein complexes were identified by 
co-immunoprecipitation in Nef or NefE4A mutant-expressing Jurkat T, and THP-1 
cells followed by exposure to Nef-specific peptides 24 h post infection. The 
MHC-I downregulation was analyzed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.
KEY FINDINGS: We found the association of Nef with PACS-2, GCC185, PI3K, AP-1, 
SFK, and MHC-I proteins that probably constitute a functional multi-protein 
complex. Furthermore, the immunoprecipitations with PACS-2 and GCC185 in the 
presence or absence of Nef, Nef E4A mutant and Nef with CP-inhibitor divide the 
functional complex of Nef into Nef-dependent (AP-1 and PI3K) and 
GCC185-dependent complex (MHC-I and SFK). The molecular mechanisms for 
activation of cellular pathways have been deciphered on the basis of these 
interactions that are brought in close proximity through Nef-GCC185 interaction. 
Knockdown of GCC185 using siRNA in Jurkat T cells showed a direct relationship 
between the assembly of functional multi-protein complex and MHC-I accumulation 
at GCC185.
SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, our study elucidates that GCC185 is a focal point for the 
assembly of the Nef-mediated multi-protein complex at TGN.

National and subnational burden of disease attributable to elevated fluoride 
levels in drinking water apportioned by sex, age group, province, and community 
type in Iran, 2017 were quantified based on disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs). The attributable burden of disease was estimated using four input data: 
(1) effect size of elevated drinking water fluoride levels for dental and 
skeletal fluorosis, (2) population distribution of drinking water fluoride 
levels, (3) the threshold levels of fluoride in drinking water for contribution 
in dental and skeletal fluorosis, and (4) age-sex distribution of population. 
The attributable burden of disease was only related to dental fluorosis, because 
the fluoride levels were lower than the threshold value for skeletal fluorosis 
(4.0 mg/L) in all of the cases. The national attributable prevalence (per 
100,000 people), DALYs, and DALY rate in 2017 were calculated to be 60 (95% 
uncertainty interval 48-69), 3443 (1034-6940), and 4.31 (1.29-8.68), 
respectively. The national attributable burden of disease was not significantly 
different by sex, but was affected by age and community type in a manner that 
the highest DALY rate was related to the age group 10-14 y (6.06 [1.82-12.21]) 
and over 66% of the national attributable DALYs occurred in rural communities. 
The attributable burden of disease occurred only in 10 out of 31 provinces and 
about 94% of the attributable DALYs were concentrated in four provinces Fars 
(1967 [592-3964]), Bushehr (414 [124-836]), West Azarbaijan (400 [120-808]), and 
Hormozgan (377 [113-761]). Implementation of fluoride-safe drinking water supply 
schemes in the four leading provinces can prevent most of the national health 
losses and partly compensate the increasing trend of disease burden from oral 
conditions at the national level.

BACKGROUND: The steady increase in the number of people suffering from chronic 
diseases and increasing life expectancy raises new demands on health care. At 
the same time, the need for informal caregivers is increasing. This study aims 
to perform a systematic review of the methodologies used to identify effect of 
different types of training on informal caregivers and their older persons.
METHODS: MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL and Ovid were searched from December 2016 and 
April 2017. The following keywords were used; "informal caregiver", "training" 
"elderly", older persons". Identified publications were screened by using the 
following inclusion criteria; systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, 
prospective cohort and multicentre studies, English language full text journals, 
samples or interventions that included caregivers of older persons and published 
in last 10 years.
RESULTS: Twenty four studies (12 randomised control trials, 8 intervention 
studies and 4 systematic reviews) were included. Most of the randomized 
controlled trials involved both caregivers and elderly. Pretests and post-tests 
were used in intervention studies (5 out of the 8 studies). ICT-based, 
psychosocial interventions on family caregivers' education program for 
caregivers were applied. Caregivers following a supportive educative learning 
had a significantly better quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this systematic review suggest that support 
interventions for caregivers can be effective in reducing caregivers' stress, 
with a consequent improvement of the quality of care. However, results are based 
on relatively small studies, reporting somewhat controversial findings 
supporting the need to perform further research in this field.

BACKGROUND: Since 2005, Russia has made substantial progress, experiencing an 
almost doubling of per-capita gross domestic product by purchasing power parity 
(GDP [PPP]) to US$24 800 and witnessing a 6-year increase in life expectancy, 
reaching 71·4 years by 2015. Even greater gains in GDP (PPP) were seen for 
Moscow, the Russian capital, reaching $43 000 in 2015 and with a life expectancy 
of 75·5 years. We aimed to investigate whether mortality levels now seen in 
Russia are consistent with what would be expected given this new level of 
per-capita wealth.
METHODS: We used per-capita GDP (PPP) and life expectancy from 61 countries in 
2014-15, plus those of Russia as a whole and its capital Moscow, to construct a 
Preston curve expressing the relationship between mortality and national wealth 
and to examine the positions of Russia and other populations relative to this 
curve. We adjusted life expectancy values for Moscow for underestimation of 
mortality at older ages. For comparison, we constructed another Preston curve 
based on the same set of countries for the year 2005. We used the stepwise 
replacement algorithm to decompose mortality differences between Russia or 
Moscow and comparator countries with similar incomes into age and cause-of-death 
components.
FINDINGS: Life expectancy in 2015 for both Russia and Moscow lay below the 
Preston-curve-based expectations by 6·5 years and 4·9 years, respectively. In 
2015, Russia had a lower per-capita income than 36 of the comparator countries 
but lower life expectancy than 60 comparator countries. However, the gaps 
between the observed and the Preston-expected life expectancy values for Russia 
have diminished by about 25% since 2005, when the life expectancy gap was 8·9 
years for Russia and 6·6 years for Moscow. When compared with countries with 
similar level of income, the largest part of the life expectancy deficit was 
produced by working-age mortality from external causes for Russia and 
cardiovascular disease at older ages for Moscow.
INTERPRETATION: Given the economic wealth of Russia, its life expectancy could 
be substantially higher. Sustaining the progress seen over the past decade 
depends on the ability of the Russian Government and society to devote adequate 
resources to people's health.

Cardiovascular Disease in Russia supported by a Wellcome Trust Strategic Award

BACKGROUND: Suboptimal diet is an important preventable risk factor for 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs); however, its impact on the burden of NCDs has 
not been systematically evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the consumption 
of major foods and nutrients across 195 countries and to quantify the impact of 
their suboptimal intake on NCD mortality and morbidity.
METHODS: By use of a comparative risk assessment approach, we estimated the 
proportion of disease-specific burden attributable to each dietary risk factor 
(also referred to as population attributable fraction) among adults aged 25 
years or older. The main inputs to this analysis included the intake of each 
dietary factor, the effect size of the dietary factor on disease endpoint, and 
the level of intake associated with the lowest risk of mortality. Then, by use 
of disease-specific population attributable fractions, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), we calculated the number of deaths and 
DALYs attributable to diet for each disease outcome.
FINDINGS: In 2017, 11 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 10-12) deaths and 
255 million (234-274) DALYs were attributable to dietary risk factors. High 
intake of sodium (3 million [1-5] deaths and 70 million [34-118] DALYs), low 
intake of whole grains (3 million [2-4] deaths and 82 million [59-109] DALYs), 
and low intake of fruits (2 million [1-4] deaths and 65 million [41-92] DALYs) 
were the leading dietary risk factors for deaths and DALYs globally and in many 
countries. Dietary data were from mixed sources and were not available for all 
countries, increasing the statistical uncertainty of our estimates.
INTERPRETATION: This study provides a comprehensive picture of the potential 
impact of suboptimal diet on NCD mortality and morbidity, highlighting the need 
for improving diet across nations. Our findings will inform implementation of 
evidence-based dietary interventions and provide a platform for evaluation of 
their impact on human health annually.

BACKGROUND: Obesity, the most prevalent chronic disease affecting multiple 
systems, is associated with increased mortality and a decreased life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify Advanced Practice Nursing 
(APN) students' confidence of obesity management as well as satisfaction of APN 
curriculum on and curricular recommendations regarding obesity management.
DESIGN: Modified convergent mixed-methods design.
SETTING: A university-based college of nursing in the Deep South.
PARTICIPANTS: Graduate APN Students.
METHODS: An exploratory mixed methods online survey was administered to APN 
students. The survey included demographics; confidence in obesity management; 
knowledge of pharmacological treatment; self-reported height and weight; 
experiences and challenges related to obesity management; and suggestions of 
curricular content changes for the treatment of obesity that would increase 
student expertise and confidence.
RESULTS: Ninety-nine surveys were completed by 94 female and five male APN 
students aged 26 to 61 years. The majority (70.7%) were white with BMIs ranging 
from 19.57 to 51.37 (x̅=27.81). Areas where students were least comfortable were 
prescribing anti-obesity medications and accurately billing for obesity 
management. Fourteen percent of APN students reported feeling that their 
graduate nursing education program did not prepare them well in obesity 
management, 25.3% reported feeling slightly well prepared, 32% reported feeling 
moderately well prepared, and 27.8% reported feeling very well or extremely well 
prepared. Qualitative responses accentuated insecurity in areas such as 
initiating a discussion on obesity management with patients who have obesity.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, APN students requested that their curriculum incorporate 
more instruction on how to begin the discussion of weight loss and provide clear 
evidence-based guidelines that include diet, exercise, and medication options. 
An efficient way to affect the management and treatment of obesity is to ensure 
that the next generation of providers is thoroughly prepared to implement the 
best evidence-based obesity management for patients.

BACKGROUND: Risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality for patients with 
versus without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) appears to vary by the age at 
T2DM diagnosis, but few population studies have analyzed mortality and CVD 
outcomes associations across the full age range.
METHODS: With use of the Swedish National Diabetes Registry, everyone with T2DM 
registered in the Registry between 1998 and 2012 was included. Controls were 
randomly selected from the general population matched for age, sex, and county. 
The analysis cohort comprised 318 083 patients with T2DM matched with just <1.6 
million controls. Participants were followed from 1998 to 2013 for CVD outcomes 
and to 2014 for mortality. Outcomes of interest were total mortality, 
cardiovascular mortality, noncardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease, 
acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. We 
also examined life expectancy by age at diagnosis. We conducted the primary 
analyses using Cox proportional hazards models in those with no previous CVD and 
repeated the work in the entire cohort.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 5.63 years, patients with T2DM 
diagnosed at ≤40 years had the highest excess risk for most outcomes relative to 
controls with adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) of 2.05 (1.81-2.33) for total 
mortality, 2.72 (2.13-3.48) for cardiovascular-related mortality, 1.95 
(1.68-2.25) for noncardiovascular mortality, 4.77 (3.86-5.89) for heart failure, 
and 4.33 (3.82-4.91) for coronary heart disease. All risks attenuated 
progressively with each increasing decade at diagnostic age; by the time T2DM 
was diagnosed at >80 years, the adjusted hazard ratios for CVD and non-CVD 
mortality were <1, with excess risks for other CVD outcomes substantially 
attenuated. Moreover, survival in those diagnosed beyond 80 was the same as 
controls, whereas it was more than a decade less when T2DM was diagnosed in 
adolescence. Finally, hazard ratios for most outcomes were numerically greater 
in younger women with T2DM.
CONCLUSIONS: Age at diagnosis of T2DM is prognostically important for survival 
and cardiovascular risks, with implications for determining the timing and 
intensity of risk factor interventions for clinical decision making and for 
guideline-directed care. These observations amplify support for 
preventing/delaying T2DM onset in younger individuals.

Reinforcement signals such as food reward and noxious punishment can change 
diverse behaviors. This holds true in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, 
which can be conditioned by an odor and sugar reward or electric shock 
punishment. Despite a wide variety of behavior modulated by learning, 
conditioned responses have been traditionally measured by altered odor 
preference in a choice, and other memory-guided behaviors have been only 
scarcely investigated. Here, we analyzed detailed conditioned odor responses of 
flies after sugar associative learning by employing a video recording and 
semi-automated processing pipeline. Trajectory analyses revealed that multiple 
behavioral components were altered along with conditioned approach to the 
rewarded odor. Notably, we found that lateral wing extension, a hallmark of 
courtship behavior of D. melanogaster, was robustly increased specifically in 
the presence of the rewarded odor. Strikingly, genetic disruption of the 
mushroom body output did not impair conditioned courtship increase, while 
markedly weakening conditioned odor approach. Our results highlight the 
complexity of conditioned responses and their distinct regulatory mechanisms 
that may underlie coordinated yet complex memory-guided behaviors in flies.

Axon length maintenance and synapse integrity are regulated by c-AMP-dependent 
protein kinase A (PKA) during larval growth of the drosophila sensory neurons.

Axonal extension and synaptic targeting are usually completed during early 
development, but the axonal length and synaptic integrity need to be actively 
maintained during later developmental stages and the adult life. Failure in the 
axonal length maintenance and the subsequent axonal degeneration have been 
associated with neurological disorders, but currently little is known about the 
genetic factors controlling this process. Here, we show that regulated 
intracellular levels of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) are critical for 
the axon maintenance during the transition from the early to the later larval 
stages in the Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. 
Our data indicate that when the intracellular levels of PKA are increased via 
genetic manipulations, these peripheral neurons initially form synapses with 
wild-type appearance, at their predicted ventral nerve cord (VNC) target sites 
(in the first and second instar larval stages), but that their synapses 
disintegrate, and the axons retract and become fragmented in the subsequent 
larval stages (third larval stage). The affected axonal endings at the 
disintegrated synaptic sites still express the characteristic presynaptic and 
cytoskeletal markers such as Bruchpilot and Fascin, indicating that the synapse 
had been initially properly formed, but that it later lost its integrity. 
Finally, the phenotype is significantly more prominent in the axons of the 
neurons whose cell bodies are located in the posterior body segments. We propose 
that the reason for this is the fact that during the larval development the 
posterior neurons face a much greater challenge while trying to keep up with the 
fast-paced growth of the larval body, and that PKA is critical for this process. 
Our data reveal PKA as a novel factor in the axonal length and synapse integrity 
maintenance in sensory neurons. These results could be of help in understanding 
neurological disorders characterized by destabilized synapses.

Most human oncogenic viruses share several characteristics, such as being DNA 
viruses, having long (co)evolutionary histories with their hosts and causing 
either latent or chronic infections. They can reach high prevalences while 
causing relatively low case mortality, which makes them quite fit according to 
virulence evolution theory. After analysing the life histories of DNA 
oncoviruses, we use a mathematical modelling approach to investigate how the 
virus life cycle may generate selective pressures favouring or acting against 
oncogenesis at the within-host or at the between-host level. In particular, we 
focus on two oncoprotein activities, namely extending cell life expectancy and 
increasing cell proliferation rate. These have immediate benefits (increasing 
viral population size) but can be associated with fitness costs at the 
epidemiological level (increasing recovery rate or risk of cancer) thus creating 
evolutionary trade-offs. We interpret the results of our nested model in light 
of the biological features and identify future perspectives for modelling 
oncovirus dynamics and evolution. This article is part of the theme issue 
'Silent cancer agents: multi-disciplinary modelling of human DNA oncoviruses'.
