BACKGROUND: While probabilistic projection methods for projecting life 
expectancy exist, few account for covariates related to life expectancy. 
Generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics have a large, immediate negative impact on the 
life expectancy in a country, but this impact can be mitigated by widespread use 
of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thus, projection methods for countries with 
generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics could be improved by accounting for HIV 
prevalence, the future course of the epidemic, and ART coverage.
METHODS: We extend the current Bayesian probabilistic life expectancy projection 
methods of Raftery et al. (2013) to account for HIV prevalence and adult ART 
coverage in countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics.
RESULTS: We evaluate our method using out-of-sample validation. We find that the 
proposed method performs better than the method that does not account for HIV 
prevalence or ART coverage for projections of life expectancy in countries with 
a generalized epidemic, while projections for countries without an epidemic 
remain essentially unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, our projections show rapid recovery to pre-epidemic 
life expectancy levels in the presence of widespread ART coverage. After the 
initial life expectancy recovery, we project a steady rise in life expectancy 
until the end of the century.
CONTRIBUTION: We develop a simple Bayesian hierarchical model for long-term 
projections of life expectancy while accounting for HIV/AIDS prevalence and 
coverage of ART. The method produces well-calibrated projections for countries 
with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics up to 2100 while having limited data 
demands.

BACKGROUND: Cancer in the elderly has become a common problem due in part to the 
increase in life expectancy. Compared to younger counterparts, the biological 
characteristics of tumors and their responsiveness to therapy may differ in 
elderly patients, and the elderly also can have a decreased tolerance to 
anticancer therapy. In addition, there is less evidence from clinical trials to 
guide physicians in treating aged patients with solid tumors. Thus, we often 
face a dilemma as to how actively to treat these patients and it would be highly 
useful to have a simple and powerful indicator of their prognosis. In this paper 
we evaluated the predictive value of the Systemic Immune-inflammation Index, 
SII, in determining the one-year survival and tumor differentiation status in 
elderly patients with newly diagnosed solid tumors.
RESULTS: A high SII > 390×109 cells/L was correlated with poor tumor 
differentiation (χ2 = 9.791, P = 0.002) and poor one-year survival (χ2 = 7.658, 
P = 0.006). Patients with low SII had improved survival and better tumor 
differentiation (Stage I-II). The SII was not associated with Ki-67 expression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 119 patients, 70 to 89 years of age with newly 
diagnosed solid tumors in 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were 
divided into two groups according to age: (1) 70-75 years of age and (2) over 75 
years of age. We calculated SII from the equation, SII = P x N/L, where P, N and 
L are the preoperative peripheral blood platelet, neutrophil and lymphocyte 
counts per liter respectively. The optimum cutoff point for SII for a favorable 
prognosis was determined to be 390×109 cells/L. For evaluation of SII as a 
prognostic indicator, the patients were divided into high SII (> 390×109 
cells/L) and low SII (≤ 390×109 cells/L) groups. Individual values were used to 
determine the relationship between SII and one-year survival, tumor 
differentiation and Ki-67 expression in the two age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: SII was a robust indicator of tumor differentiation and one-year 
survival in elderly patients with newly diagnosed solid tumors. Patients in the 
high SII group showed poor tumor differentiation and poor prognosis compared to 
patients with a low SII score.

Metastatic bony lesions involving proximal femur and hip joint pose a challenge 
to orthopedic surgeons. Lesions in this important weight-bearing zone of the 
femur weaken its ability to sustain load causing pain and impending pathologic 
fracture. These Patients warrant multidisciplinary approach including orthopedic 
surgeons, oncologist and medical specialties. Management of these lesions has 
evolved over the last 60 years from benign neglect to internal fixation and 
recently to prosthetic reconstruction for optimum function. Decision for 
surgical approach requires consideration for location of the lesion, presence of 
a fracture, tumor type, cortical destruction, patient's life expectancy, patient 
preferences and the expected outcome. We aim to present a narrative review of 
the options and results of surgical management of these lesions in the light of 
literature.

PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to assess differences of limb symmetry 
index (LSI) in strength- and coordination-related tasks between high-level, 
competitive, noninjured ski racers of different age-related performance levels 
and to prospectively assess limb differences as a possible risk factor for 
traumatic and overuse injury in youth ski racers.
METHODS: The study (Study 1) included 285 high-level competitive ski racers (125 
females, 160 males) of 3 age-related performance levels and based on the school 
system: 95 youth (10-14 years, secondary modern school), 107 adolescent (15-19 
years, grammar school), and 83 elite athletes (20-34 years). To investigate the 
second aim (Study 2), 67 of the 95 youth athletes were included and any 
traumatic or overuse injuries were prospectively recorded over 2 seasons. All 
athletes performed 4 unilateral tests (strength related: one-leg counter 
movement jump (OL-CMJ) and one-leg isometric/isokinetic press strength test 
(OL-ILS); coordination related: one-leg stability test (OL-ST) and one-leg 
speedy jump test (OL-SJ)). The LSI was calculated by dividing the dominant leg 
by the nondominant leg and multiplying by 100. Kruskal-Wallis H tests and binary 
logistic regression analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: There were significant differences between the LSI of the 3 age-related 
performance-level groups only in the strength-related tests: the OL-CMJ (χ²(2, 
285) = 9.09; p = 0.01) and the OL-ILS (χ²(2, 285) = 14.79; p < 0.01). The LSI 
for OL-ILS was found to be a significant risk factor for traumatic injury in 
youth ski racers (Wald = 7.08; p < 0.01). No significant risk factors were found 
for overuse injuries.
CONCLUSION: Younger athletes display slightly greater LSI values only in the 
strength-related tests. The cut-off value of limb differences of <10% for return 
to sport decisions seems to be appropriate for elite athletes, but for youth and 
adolescent athletes it has to be critically discussed. It seems to be necessary 
to define thresholds based on specific performance tasks (strength vs. 
coordination related) rather than on generalizations, and age-related 
performance levels must be considered. Limb differences in unilateral leg 
extension strength represent a significant injury risk factor in youth ski 
racers.

As life expectancy and obesity increase in low and middle-income countries, the 
relationship of weight status to functional outcomes in older adults in these 
settings requires attention. We examined how overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2), 
obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2), and high waist circumference (WC > 80 cm) related to 
grip strength, timed up-and-go, and development of limitations in mobility, 
activities of daily living (ADL), and instrumental activities of daily living 
(IADL) among Filipino women. We analyzed data from seven rounds of the Cebu 
Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (1994, n = 2279 to 2015, n = 1568, age 
49-78 years) to examine how women's reports of functional limitations related to 
their prior WC, and how their grip strength and timed up-and-go related to 
concurrently measured overweight and obesity, adjusted for age, socioeconomic 
status, and urbanicity. High WC was associated with higher odds of subsequent 
mobility and IADL limitations. Chronic disease morbidity (sum of self-reported 
arthritis, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer) fully 
mediated the association of high WC with ADL and IADL limitations, but not 
physical/mobility limitations. Longer up-and-go times, and higher grip strength 
were related to overweight and obesity. Results emphasize the need for obesity 
prevention to reduce chronic diseases and maintain good functional status as 
women age.

Objectives: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore factors that 
influence older persons' will to live (WTL).Methods: Twenty-five Israeli elders 
were interviewed about what weakens and/or strengthens their WTL. Elements of 
the grounded theory method guided the data collection and analysis.Results: Our 
analysis revealed that the elements that pertain to WTL could potentially both 
increase and decrease the WTL in elders. These factors included social networks, 
financial security, religious faith, working and volunteering, and honor versus 
ageism.Conclusions: Five factors represent different aspects of older persons' 
lives that influence the WTL. The first four themes including Social Networks, 
Religious Faith, Honor versus Ageism, and Working and Volunteering are 
consistent with the findings of the study of Blue Zones. Blue Zones are areas 
characterized by high life expectancy. Israel shares cultural characteristics 
with the Blue Zones, being a society with traditional collective characteristics 
stemming from the Jewish tradition. The last theme of financial security is 
related to the characteristics of Israel as a society in which the social gaps 
are large and many elderly are pushed to the social margins, and lack financial 
security. This study points to the unique cultural characteristics of Israel 
that affect the WTL among elderly Jews and proposes a hypothesis linking Israeli 
culture to the high life expectancy in Israel.

Family Member Death and Subjective Life Expectancy Among Black and White Older 
Adults.

Donnelly R(1), Umberson D(1), Pudrovska T(1).

Author information:
(1)The University of Texas at Austin, USA.

Objective: To examine whether exposure to family member deaths throughout the 
life course is associated with subjective life expectancy-a person's assessment 
of their own mortality risk-at age 65, with attention to differences by race. 
Method: We analyzed 11 waves of data from a study of men and women above age 50 
(Health and Retirement Study; n = 13,973). Results: Experiencing the deaths of 
multiple family members before the respondent is 50 years old is negatively 
associated with subjective life expectancy at age 65. Discussion: Understanding 
the life-course predictors of older adults' subjective life expectancy is 
particularly important because survival expectations influence long-term 
planning, health, and longevity. Moreover, Black Americans are exposed to more 
family member deaths earlier in their life compared with White Americans, with 
implications for long-term health and well-being.

BACKGROUND: Treatment with apremilast has recently demonstrated clinically 
meaningful improvement in moderate hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the change in expression of inflammatory markers in 
lesional skin of HS patients receiving apremilast 30 mg twice daily (n = 15) for 
16 weeks compared with placebo (n = 5).
METHODS: At baseline, 5-mm punch biopsies were obtained from an index lesion 
(HSL) and non-lesional (HSN) skin in the same anatomical area. Subsequent HSL 
samples were taken as close as possible to the previously biopsied site at week 
4 and week 16. After sampling, biopsies were split; one half was processed for 
in vivo mRNA analysis using real-time quantitative PCR; the other half was 
cultured for ex vivo protein analysis using a proximity extension assay (Olink). 
Linear mixed effects models were calculated to compare the levels of 
inflammatory markers in HSL skin between apremilast and placebo over time.
RESULTS: At baseline, 17 proteins with a fold change >2 in HSL vs. HSN skin were 
identified in 20 patients. The top five were IL-17A (5), S100A12, CST5, 
IL-12/23p40, CD6 (1) with fold changes ranging from 6.6 to 1638, respectively 
(FDR <0.044). Linear mixed effects models for 75 assays were calculated. Protein 
levels of S100A12 decreased during treatment in the apremilast group compared 
with the placebo group (p = 0.014, FDR = 0.186). None of the 14 genes exhibited 
significant changes in expression over time. However, an evident downward trend 
in relative mRNA expression of IL-17A and IL-17F was demonstrated in patients 
receiving apremilast.
CONCLUSION: We did not detect statistically significant changes in inflammatory 
markers in HSL skin of HS patients receiving apremilast compared with placebo, 
despite clinical improvement in the apremilast group. Nonetheless, S100A12 and 
IL-17A were significantly elevated in HSL skin and showed a decrease in response 
to apremilast. The translational model in clinical trials involving HS clearly 
needs further improvement.

There are increasing demands for informative cancer biomarkers, accessible via 
minimally invasive procedures, both for initial diagnostics and for follow-up of 
personalized cancer therapy, including immunotherapy. Fine-needle aspiration 
(FNA) biopsy provides ready access to relevant tissue samples; however, the 
minute amounts of sample require sensitive multiplex molecular analysis to be of 
clinical biomarker utility. We have applied proximity extension assays (PEA) to 
analyze 167 proteins in FNA samples from patients with breast cancer (BC; 
n = 25) and benign lesions (n = 32). We demonstrate that the FNA BC samples 
could be divided into two main clusters, characterized by differences in 
expression levels of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the proliferation marker 
Ki67. This clustering corresponded to some extent to established BC subtypes. 
Our analysis also revealed several proteins whose expression levels differed 
between BC and benign lesions (e.g., CA9, GZMB, IL-6, VEGFA, CXCL11, PDL1, and 
PCD1), as well as several chemokines correlating with ER and Ki67 status (e.g., 
CCL4, CCL8, CCL20, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL17). Finally, we also identified three 
signatures that could predict Ki67 status, ER status, and tumor grade, 
respectively, based on a small subset of proteins, which was dominated by 
chemokines. To our knowledge, expression profiles of CCL13 in benign lesions and 
BC have not previously been described but were shown herein to correlate with 
proliferation (P = 0.00095), suggesting a role in advanced BC. Given the broad 
functional range of the proteins analyzed, immune-related proteins were 
overrepresented among the observed alterations. Our pilot study supports the 
emerging role of chemokines in BC progression. Due to the minimally traumatic 
sampling and clinically important molecular information for therapeutic 
decisions, this methodology is promising for future immunoscoring and monitoring 
of treatment efficacy in BC.

OBJECTIVE: The number of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) has 
increased substantially because of medical advances that are extending life 
expectancy beyond childhood. A historical investigation is timely not only 
because of this significant demographic shift, but also because stakeholder 
engagement is increasingly important in shaping research directions. The study 
questions were: From the perspective of stakeholders, what is known about the 
medical treatment for the adult CHD cohort in Canada and how has it changed over 
time?
DESIGN/METHODS: We harnessed the use of historical research methods and 
conducted interviews with 21 key informants in order to articulate a 
contextualized understanding of the evolution of adult CHD treatment in Canada. 
The informants recruited were currently or previously located in and/or involved 
in treatment in seven provinces and two territories across Canada including 
patients, families, advocates, researchers, and practitioners located in 
disciplines that included cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, nursing, 
psychology, dietetics, and kinesiology.
RESULTS: Alongside findings that highlighted the significant demographic shift, 
the findings highlight key themes related to temporal shifts in treatment, 
emergence of organizational structures and use of evidence, comprehensive 
approaches to care, and future directions. A critical finding that requires 
immediate attention is the significantly disproportionate resources to the 
number of adults living with CHD, and as a result, the real risk of premature 
death for this population.
CONCLUSIONS: The insights provided behoove the community of stakeholders to 
think creatively on how to draw attention to the inadequacy of resources and the 
unique and diverse needs of this population.

First Report of Stubby-Root Nematode, Paratrichodorus minor, on Onion in 
Georgia, U.S.A.

Onions ( Allium cepa L.) are the leading vegetable crop in Georgia accounting 
for 13.7% of total state vegetable production ( Wolfe and Stubbs, 2017 ). In 
November 2017, two samples each of onion (var. Candy Ann) seedlings and soil 
were received from the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension office in 
Tattnall County, GA. The samples were collected from a nursery fumigated with 
metam sodium and used for sweet onion transplant production. Symptoms of the 
damaged plants included stunted growth both in the root system and foliage, tip 
die-back of the leaves ( Fig. 1A,B ), and slight swelling at the tip of roots. 
Vermiform life stages from the soil samples were extracted using 
centrifugal-flotation technique ( Jenkins, 1964 ). On an average, 67 stubby-root 
nematodes per 100 cm 3 of soil were obtained. Additional two soil samples were 
collected from the nursery in December 2017 to confirm the presence of the 
nematode. On an average, 1 and 75 nematodes per 100 cm 3 of soil were recovered 
from areas with healthy and infested plants, respectively. Because the male 
individuals were not found in the soil samples, females were used for species 
identification. Morphological and molecular analyses of females ( Fig. 2A-C ) 
identified the species as Paratrichodorus minor (Colbran) Siddiqi; ( Decraemer, 
1995 ). Nematode body shape was "cigar-shaped" with dorsally curved 
"onchiostyle" stylet Females had an oval-shaped vagina, vulva a transverse slit, 
and lateral body pores were absent. The measurements of females ( n = 20) 
included: body length 671.1 (570.1-785.3) µm; body width 32.5 (27.8-37.0) µm; 
onchiostyle 32.5 (31.1-34.8) µm; anterior end to esophagus-intestinal valve 
117.6 (101.2-128.5) µm; a 21.5 (15.3-28.1) µm; b 5.2 (4.9-6.3) µm; V 52.9% 
(48.1-55.4%) µm; and vagina length 8.7 (7.8-10.7) µm. To confirm the identity of 
P. minor, DNA was extracted from single females ( n = 3) using Extract-N-Amp ™ 
Tissue PCR Kit (Sigma-Alredich Inc., St. Louis, MO). The partial 18S rRNA, the 
D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S rRNA, and ITS1 rDNA were amplified using primer 
pairs 360F (5' CTACCACATCCAAGGAAGGC 3')/932R (5' TATCTGATCGCTGTCGAACC 3'), D2A 
(5' ACAAGTACCGTGAGGGAAAGTTG 3')/D3B (5' TCGGAAGGAACCAGCTACTA 3'), and BL18 (5' 
CCCGTCGCTACTACCGATT 3')/5818 (5' ACGARCCGAGTGATCCAC 3'), respectively ( Riga et 
al., 2007 ; Duarte et al., 2010 ; Ye et al., 2015 ; Shaver et al., 2016 ). The 
obtained PCR fragments were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen 
Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), sequenced and deposited in the GenBank databases 
(18S rRNA: MG856931; 28S rRNA: MG856933; ITS1 rDNA: MH464152). The 18S rRNA, 28S 
D2-D3, and ITS1 rDNA sequences shared 99% similarity (100% coverage) with 
GenBank accessions of P. minor from California, Arkansas, and China (18S rRNA: 
JN123365; 28S D2-D3: JN123395; ITS1 rDNA: GU645811). In a pathogenicity test, 
five sweet onion seeds var. Pirate were planted (one per pot) in 
11.5-cm-diameter polyethylene pots containing 1,000 cm 3 of equal parts of 
pasteurized field soil and sand, and then inoculated with 1,000 fresh P. minor . 
Plants were grown for 9 wk in a greenhouse at 25 ± 2°C prior to extraction of 
nematodes from soil. Plant roots were abbreviated and final population density 
of P. minor was 2,856 ± 104 per pot (285 nematodes/100 cm 3 of soil) confirming 
the nematode parasitism on onion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 
P. minor parasitizing onion in Georgia. Stubby-root nematode ( Paratrichodorus 
sp.) has already been reported on corn, St. Augustine grass, and switchgrass in 
Georgia ( Heald and Perry, 1969 ; Davis and Timper, 2000 ; Mekete et al., 2011 
). In the U.S.A, P. minor is known to occur on diverse crops in most of the 
states ( Decraemer, 1995 ; CABI/EPPO, 2002 ). A survey of vegetable-producing 
areas in Georgia is currently under investigation to determine the distribution 
of this economically important nematode species. Figure 1Damage symptoms caused

The process of population aging is a worldwide reality becoming a global public 
health challenge. Although population aging is especially noticeable in more 
developed regions, there has also been a significant advance in the quantity of 
elderly people in areas with unfavourable socioeconomic indicators, and a rapid 
growth in countries with a low level of economic development. This article 
presents an analysis based on spatial autocorrelation of the relationship 
between life expectancy and social determinants in a north-eastern region of 
Brazil. An ecological study was conducted using the secondary data of social, 
demographic, and health indicators of elderly people collected in the Brazilian 
Demographic Census of the 75 municipalities of the state of Sergipe. Spatial 
autocorrelation was evaluated using the Moran global index and the local 
indicators of space association. Multiple linear regression models were used to 
identify the relationship between life expectancy and social determinants. The 
South-eastern region of the state presented clusters with all indicators 
pointing to acceptable lifestyles, whereas the municipalities of the 
north-western and far-eastern regions were characterized by values demonstrating 
precarious living conditions. The high dependency ratio, illiteracy rate, and 
unemployment rate among elderly people had a negative impact on life expectancy. 
The evidence confirms that there is an autocorrelation between social 
determinants and life expectancy, indicating that the worse the social, 
economic, and health indicators are, the lower the life expectancy. This finding 
indicates the need to redirect public policies and formulate strategies aimed at 
reducing social and health inequalities.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To investigate prognostic factors for death within 6 months 
of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for patients with peripheral 
early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis included 586 NSCLC patients with peripheral 
tumors treated with SBRT. Potential patient and tumor prognostic factors, 
including the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and Cumulative Illness Rating 
Scale (CIRS), were analyzed by logistic regression analysis for association with 
early mortality (death <6 months after SBRT). Additionally, CCI and CIRS were 
compared with respect to their predictive ability for early mortality by 
comparing multivariate models with each comorbidity index, and assessing their 
respective discriminatory abilities (C-index).
RESULTS: A total of 36 patients (6.1%) died within 6 months of the start of 
SBRT. With a median follow-up of 25 months, 3-year overall survival was 54%. 
CIRS and tumor diameter were significant predictors of early mortality on 
multivariate analysis (p = .001). Patients with a CIRS score of 8 or higher and 
a tumor diameter over 3 cm had a 6-month survival of 70% versus 97% for those 
lacking these two features (p < .001). CCI was not predictive for early 
mortality on univariate nor multivariate analysis; the model containing CCI had 
a C-index of 0.65 versus 0.70 for the model containing CIRS.
CONCLUSION: CIRS and tumor diameter predict for early-mortality in peripheral 
early-stage NSCLC treated with SBRT. CIRS may be a more useful comorbidity index 
than CCI in this population when assessing short-term life expectancy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness 
of arch support functional insoles to prevent metatarsalgia.
METHOD: Twenty-five healthy females participated in the study. A Vicon motion 
capture system was used to collect kinematics data of the lower limb. An AMTI 
force plate was used to record the vertical ground reaction force (GRF), and the 
Novel Pedar-X System was used to measure foot pressure while subjects wore 
normal insoles or functional insoles with an arch support during walking and 
jogging.
RESULTS: With the arch support functional insoles, the first metatarsal (FM) 
region's contact area was increased and the peak pressure and time-pressure 
integral of the FM and second and third metatarsal (SATM) were areas decreased. 
This suggests a lower risk of longitude stress injuries in these areas. The 
ankle dorsiflexion angle of jogging with the 'arch support functional insoles' 
(RF) and walking with the 'arch support functional insoles' (WF) were 
significantly increased at initial contact and the knee and hip flexion angle of 
RF and WF were reduced. The peak hip extension angle of WF and RF also declined. 
The vertical loading rate of RF was lower, which would be beneficial in reducing 
the risk of lower limb injuries during jogging.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that arch support functional insoles can be 
used effectively to prevent and decrease pain and promote a suitable 
weight-bearing pattern in the foot for promoting the health of young females.

Understanding the effect of molecular pathways involved in the age-dependent 
deterioration of stem cell function is critical for developing new therapies. 
The overexpression of Klotho (KL), an antiaging protein, causes treated animal 
models to enjoy extended life spans. Now, the question stands: Does KL 
deficiency accelerate stem cell aging and telomere shortening? If so, what are 
the specific mechanisms by which it does this, and is cycloastragenol (CAG) 
treatment enough to restore telomerase activity in aged stem cells? We found 
that KL deficiency diminished telomerase activity by altering the expression of 
TERF1 and TERT, causing impaired differentiation potential, pluripotency, 
cellular senescence, and apoptosis in stem cells. Telomerase activity decreased 
with KL-siRNA knockdown. This suggests that both KL and telomeres regulate the 
stem cell aging process through telomerase subunits TERF1, POT1, and TERT using 
the TGFβ, Insulin, and Wnt signaling. These pathways can rejuvenate stem cell 
populations in a CD90-dependent mechanism. Stem cell dysfunctions were largely 
provoked by KL deficiency and telomere shortening, owing to altered expression 
of TERF1, TGFβ1, CD90, POT1, TERT, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). 
The CAG treatment partially rescued telomerase deterioration, suggesting that KL 
plays a critical role in life-extension by regulating telomere length and 
telomerase activity.

Committing to Priorities: Incompleteness in Macro-Level Health Care Allocation 
and Its Implications.

Herlitz A(1)(2).

Author information:

This article argues that values that apply to health care allocation entail the 
possibility of "spectrum arguments," and that it is plausible that they often 
fail to determine a best alternative. In order to deal with this problem, a 
two-step process is suggested. First, we should identify the Strongly Uncovered 
Set that excludes all alternatives that are worse than some alternatives and not 
better in any relevant dimension from the set of eligible alternatives. Because 
the remaining set of alternatives often contain more than one element, we need 
some complementary method of selecting a unique alternative. In order to address 
this issue, I suggest that we must invoke caps on the values that are used to 
evaluate alternatives, and that these caps must be grounded in collective 
commitments.

While the environmental impacts of livestock production, such as greenhouse gas 
emissions and water usage, have been studied for a variety of US livestock 
production systems, the environmental impact of US sheep production is still 
unknown. A cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted 
according to international standards (ISO 14040/44), analyzing the impacts of CS 
representing five different meat sheep production systems in California, and 
focusing on carbon footprint (carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2e) and irrigated 
water usage (metric ton, MT). This study is the first to look specifically at 
the carbon footprint of the California sheep industry and consider both wool and 
meat production across the diverse sheep production systems within California. 
This study also explicitly examined the carbon footprint of hair sheep as 
compared with wooled sheep production. Data were derived from producer 
interviews and literature values, and California-specific emission factors were 
used wherever possible. Flock outputs studied included market lamb meat, 
breeding stock, 2-d-old lambs, cull adult meat, and wool. Four different methane 
prediction models were examined, including the current IPCC tier 1 and 2 
equations, and an additional sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the 
effect of a fixed vs. flexible coefficient of gain (kg) in mature ewes on carbon 
footprint per ewe. Mass, economic, and protein mass allocation were used to 
examine the impact of allocation method on carbon footprint and water usage, 
while sensitivity analyses were used to examine the impact of ewe replacement 
rate (% of ewe flock per year) and lamb crop (lambs born per ewe bred) on carbon 
footprint per kilogram market lamb. The carbon footprint of market lamb 
production ranged from 13.9 to 30.6 kg CO2e/kg market lamb production on a mass 
basis, 10.4 to 18.1 kg CO2e/kg market lamb on an economic basis, and 6.6 to 10.1 
kg CO2e/kg market lamb on a protein mass basis. Enteric methane (CH4) production 
was the largest single source of emissions for all CS, averaging 72% of total 
emissions. Emissions from feed production averaged 22% in total, primarily from 
manure emissions credited to feed. Whole-ranch water usage ranged from 2.1 to 
44.8 MT/kg market lamb, almost entirely from feed production. Overall results 
were in agreement with those from meat-focused sheep systems in the United 
Kingdom as well as beef raised under similar conditions in California.

Hemolytic⁻uremic syndrome is a life-threating disease most often associated with 
Shiga toxin-producing microorganisms like Escherichia coli (STEC), including E. 
coli O157:H7. Shiga toxin is encoded by resident prophages present within this 
bacterium, and both its production and release depend on the induction of Shiga 
toxin-encoding prophages. Consequently, treatment of STEC infections tend to be 
largely supportive rather than antibacterial, in part due to concerns about 
exacerbating such prophage induction. Here we explore STEC O157:H7 prophage 
induction in vitro as it pertains to phage therapy-the application of 
bacteriophages as antibacterial agents to treat bacterial infections-to curtail 
prophage induction events, while also reducing STEC O157:H7 presence. We 
observed that cultures treated with strictly lytic phages, despite being lysed, 
produce substantially fewer Shiga toxin-encoding temperate-phage virions than 
untreated STEC controls. We therefore suggest that phage therapy could have 
utility as a prophylactic treatment of individuals suspected of having been 
recently exposed to STEC, especially if prophage induction and by extension 
Shiga toxin production is not exacerbated.

Purpose: Perilunate (fracture) dislocations are rare injuries and diminished 
functional outcomes are reported. However, Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) 
following these injuries are rarely described. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the long-term impact of perilunate (fracture) dislocations using a 
range of measures, including pain, function, and quality of life.Materials and 
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2016 until March 
2016. Eleven patients who had suffered from perilunate (fracture) dislocations 
between August 1996 and January 2014 were matched on age and gender with 22 
healthy controls. Functional outcome included range of motion and grip strength 
measurements. The Patient Reported Outcomes included: Patient Reported Wrist 
Evaluation, Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire, Michigan Hand 
Questionnaire and the Short Form-36.Results: The 11 patients that were included 
(9 males) had a median age at injury of 38 years (IQR 33; 54) and median follow 
up of 97 months (IQR 84-193). Flexion/extension (mean difference -60°, 95% CI 
-76, -43, p < 0.001) and ulnar/radial deviation (mean difference -28°, 95% CI 
-38, -18, p < 0.001) were significantly diminished in patients following 
perilunate (fracture) dislocations. Grip strength was not affected. The patients 
experienced significantly more pain as assessed on all pain subscales. Physical 
functioning was significantly worse in the group with perilunate (fracture) 
dislocations as assessed on all function subscales, except the PRWE function 
score and the subscale physical functioning of the Short Form-36. Satisfaction 
as measured with the Michigan Hand Questionnaire satisfaction subscale (mean 
difference -36, 95% CI -57, -16, p = 0.002) was also reported poorer. No 
difference was found regarding work participation.Conclusions: A perilunate 
(fracture) dislocation has a significant impact on everyday life, as patients 
experience diminished range of motion, pain, diminished physical functioning, 
diminished satisfaction and report lower general health status than healthy 
controls. However, no consequences for work participation were found in this 
study. Level of evidence 3.Implications for rehabilitationFlexion/extension and 
ulnar/radial deviation remains limited following perilunate (fracture) 
dislocations.Grip strength is not diminished in patients with perilunate 
(fracture) dislocations.Pain, restrictions in physical functioning, diminished 
satisfaction and lower general health status are likely to be present following 
perilunate (fracture) dislocations.If conservative treatment including pain 
medication and rehabilitation strategies do not relief pain following perilunate 
(fracture) dislocations, surgical treatment options such as wrist denervation or 
arthrodesis should be considered.

Nine of 23 (39%) research ewes with severe diarrhea and weight loss had 
histologic lesions consistent with Eimeria gilruthi infection in their abomasa. 
Gross anatomic lesions included hundreds of opaque 1-mm nodules in abomasal 
mucosa that corresponded microscopically to 200-300 µm diameter organisms 
surrounded by areas of necrosis. Analysis of fecal samples from 4 ewes 
demonstrated oocysts from typical ovine Eimeria species, none of which were E. 
gilruthi. Two separate PCR reactions were performed on abomasal tissue from 4 
sheep to amplify the 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and internal transcribed spacer 
(ITS) region of the rDNA, respectively. The resultant 18S rDNA nucleotide 
sequences shared 99% homology with multiple Eimeria species in GenBank. The ITS 
region shared 77% homology with E. ellipsoidalis in GenBank. Further studies are 
needed to understand the life cycle and pathogenicity of E. gilruthi. Our 
results underscore the inclusion of E. gilruthi in the differential diagnosis of 
diarrhea and weight loss in sheep.

BACKGROUND: Although the etiology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the 
most common type of adult leukemia, is still unclear, strong evidence implicates 
antigen involvement in disease ontogeny and evolution. Primary and 3D structure 
analysis has been utilised in order to discover indications of antigenic 
pressure. The latter has been mostly based on the 3D models of the clonotypic B 
cell receptor immunoglobulin (BcR IG) amino acid sequences. Therefore, their 
accuracy is directly dependent on the quality of the model construction 
algorithms and the specific methods used to compare the ensuing models. Thus 
far, reliable and robust methods that can group the IG 3D models based on their 
structural characteristics are missing.
