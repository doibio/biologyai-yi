Клинические симптомы ПНПИЦ разнообразны и наиболее часто включают онемение 
конечностей и/или повышенную чувствительность к тепловым или механическим 
раздражителям, нейропатическую боль. В настоящее время для предупреждения ПНПИЦ 
проводят модификацию лечения с сокращением длительности курсов и доз 
цитостатиков, прерыванием лечения. Официальные руководства не рекомендуют 
какие-либо средства для профилактики, кроме возможного использования дулоксетина 
или местного геля, содержащего баклофен, амитриптилин и кетамин. За последние 
несколько лет не достигнуто существенного прогресса в области профилактики и 
лечения ПНПИЦ. Наиболее распространенным в клинической практике медикаментозным 
методом ее лечения является назначение препаратов витаминов группы В. Из 
немедикаментозных методов лечения ПНПИЦ авторами использовались акупунктура, 
электроакупунктура, мануальная терапия, массаж, лечебная гимнастика, йога, 
сенсомоторные тренировки, общая вибрационная терапия, чрескожная 
электронейростимуляция, электроаналгезия, местная криотерапия, гидротерапия, 
низкоинтенсивное переменное магнитное поле. Исследования, включенные в обзор, 
разнородны по дизайну и протоколу, числу больных и временны́м точкам оценки 
результатов. В связи с имеющимися различиями провести сравнительный анализ 
результатов указанных видов реабилитации и дать однозначный ответ об их 
эффективности не представляется возможным. Как показал анализ, периферическая 
ПНИЦ хорошо известна во всем мире, однако поиск методов ее лечения далек от 
завершения.

OBJECTIVES: Lung transplant is the most important treatment approach that 
improves the life expectancy and quality of life for patients with cystic 
fibrosis with end-stage lung disease. In this study, we retros-pectively 
analyzed patients with cystic fibrosis who were referred to our lung transplant 
program in Turkey.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 14 patients with cystic fibrosis who were 
referred to our lung transplant clinic between December 2016 and December 2019. 
The characteristics of the patients at the time of referral to our lung 
transplant clinic, survival, and lung transplant results were recorded.
RESULTS: Four patients died on the wait list, 3 patients were not eligible for 
lung transplant, and lung transplant was performed in 7 patients. The mean age 
of all patients was 22.8 years (range, 11-41 years), and the mean age for 
patients who underwent lung transplant was 27.5 years (range, 21-41 years). The 
mean time of suitable donor offer or survival life was 140 days in the patients 
who were referred for lung transplant. The 1-year mortality rate was 28.6% (2 of 
7 patients) after lung transplant. One patient died of chronic lung allograft 
dysfunction at the 25th month after lung transplant. Four patients were alive 
without any problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplant is the final treatment method for patients with 
cystic fibrosis with terminal period lung disease. To provide the best benefit, 
patients should be evaluated for transplant early. Cystic fibrosis care clinics 
and lung transplant clinics should work in coordination in order to increase the 
number of lung transplants and improve outcomes.

Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended for the treatment of 
fibromyalgia, but there is a lack of knowledge about the cost-effectiveness of 
these interventions. The aim of this study was to systematically review economic 
evaluations of educational, physical, and psychological interventions for the 
treatment of fibromyalgia. The search was performed in PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, 
Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, PsycINFO, EconLit, National 
Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and Health Technology Assessment. 
Economic evaluations of educational, physical, and psychological interventions 
for adult patients with fibromyalgia were included. Primary outcomes were 
healthcare and societal costs, and quality-adjusted life-years, and secondary 
outcomes were any disease-specific clinical outcome. Costs and effects were 
pooled in a meta-analysis, when possible. Eleven studies were included, of which 
7 compared a psychological intervention with another intervention or usual 
care/control. Over a 6-month time horizon, healthcare and societal costs of the 
psychological intervention were significantly lower than usual care (mean 
difference: $-2087, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3061 to -1112; mean 
difference: $-2411, 95% CI: -3582 to -1240, respectively), and healthcare costs 
were significantly lower for the psychological intervention compared with a 
pharmacological intervention (mean difference: $-1443, 95% CI: -2165 to -721). 
Over a 12-month time horizon, healthcare costs for the psychological 
intervention were significantly lower than for usual care (mean difference: 
$-538, 95% CI: -917 to -158). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for 
quality-adjusted life-years and impact of fibromyalgia showed that the 
psychological intervention was cost-effective compared with other interventions 
and control conditions. There is a need of more economic evaluations conducted 
alongside randomized controlled trials with interventions recommended for the 
treatment of fibromyalgia, such as physical exercise.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to illustrate the potential utility of a simple 
filter model in understanding the patient outcome and cost-effectiveness 
implications for depression interventions in primary care.
METHODS: Modelling of hypothetical intervention scenarios during different 
stages of the treatment pathway was conducted.
RESULTS: Three scenarios were developed for depression related to increasing 
detection, treatment response and treatment uptake. The incremental costs, 
incremental number of successes (i.e., depression remission) and the incremental 
costs-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. In the modelled scenarios, 
increasing provider treatment response resulted in the greatest number of 
incremental successes above baseline, however, it was also associated with the 
greatest ICER. Increasing detection rates was associated with the second 
greatest increase to incremental successes above baseline and had the lowest 
ICER.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors recommend utility of the filter model to guide the 
identification of areas where policy stakeholders and/or researchers should 
invest their efforts in depression management.

Packaging is an integral part of food industry that preserves the properties of 
food during storage. Food spoilage caused by foodborne microorganisms is a 
public health problem that imposes a significant burden on the healthcare 
systems. Moreover, packaging based on artificial and chemical materials such as 
plastic is destructive to the environment. Chitosan can be categorized as an 
active food packaging material because of its inherent antimicrobial properties 
and capacity to carry various active components. Combining chitosan and metallic 
nanoparticles can be used as a practical approach in antimicrobial packaging 
systems. This strategy has advantages of thermal stability, barrier properties, 
antioxidant and antimicrobial packaging. Titanium dioxide is one of these 
nanoparticles that plays a photocatalytic role by releasing reactive oxygen 
species, thereby leading to the destruction of microorganisms' cell wall and 
extension of food shelf life. This review elaborates on the antimicrobial 
applications of chitosan/titanium dioxide nanoparticles films in food packaging 
systems.

BACKGROUND: Increasing studies reported increased mortality risk associated with 
exposure to lower-than-standard air pollution. This study aimed to investigate 
mortality burden and life expectancy loss due to lower-than-standard particulate 
matter air pollution in Hong Kong, China.
METHODS: We obtained 17-year (2000-2016) daily time-series data on mortality, 
particulate matters with aerodynamic diameters <2.5 μm (PM2.5) and <10 μm 
(PM10). We applied a distributed lag non-linear model to fit the association of 
years of life lost (YLL) with PM2.5 and PM10. Total YLL attributable to PM2.5 
and PM10 concentrations below ambient air quality standards were estimated.
RESULTS: We estimated 5.2% of total YLL due to PM2.5, of which, 33.5%, 52.8% and 
94.5% occurred in concentrations not exceeding the criterion of WHO, the USA, 
and China, corresponding to 0.3, 0.4 and 0.7 years loss in life expectancy, 
respectively. There was 6.9% (annual 34434.4 YLL) of total YLL due to PM10, of 
which, 50.7%, 50.7%, 99.5% and 99.5% occurred in concentrations below the 
criterion of WHO, Europe, the USA, and China, which corresponded to 0.5, 0.5, 1 
and 1 year loss in life expectancy, respectively. Assuming that PM2.5 and PM10 
concentrations had met stricter standards, more gains in life expectancy could 
be expected in women than in men, in people aged up to 64 years than those of 65 
years or older, and in those with respiratory disease than those with 
cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to lower-than-standard particulate matters air pollution 
could shorten life expectancy and incur massive mortality burden in Hong Kong.

OBJECTIVE: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of the Program ACTIVE (Adults 
Coming Together to Increase Vital Exercise) II community-based exercise (EXER), 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and EXER+CBT interventions in adults with 
type 2 diabetes and depression relative to usual care (UC) and each other.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were integrated into the Michigan Model for 
Diabetes to estimate cost and health outcomes over a 10-year simulation time 
horizon from the health care sector and societal perspectives, discounting costs 
and benefits at 3% annually. Primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: From the health care sector perspective, the EXER intervention strategy 
saved $313 (USD) per patient and produced 0.38 more QALY (cost saving), the CBT 
intervention strategy cost $596 more and gained 0.29 more QALY ($2,058/QALY), 
and the EXER+CBT intervention strategy cost $403 more and gained 0.69 more QALY 
($585/QALY) compared with UC. Both EXER and EXER+CBT interventions dominated the 
CBT intervention. Compared with EXER, the EXER+CBT intervention strategy cost 
$716 more and gained 0.31 more QALY ($2,323/QALY). From the societal 
perspective, compared with UC, the EXER intervention strategy saved $126 (cost 
saving), the CBT intervention strategy cost $2,838/QALY, and the EXER+CBT 
intervention strategy cost $1,167/QALY. Both EXER and EXER+CBT interventions 
still dominated the CBT intervention. In comparison with EXER, the EXER+CBT 
intervention strategy cost $3,021/QALY. Results were robust in sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: All three Program ACTIVE II interventions represented a good value 
for money compared with UC. The EXER+CBT intervention was highly cost-effective 
or cost saving compared with the CBT or EXER interventions.

Lentiviruses are increasingly used as gene delivery vehicles for vaccines and 
immunotherapies. However, the purification of clinical-grade lentivirus vectors 
for therapeutic use is still troublesome and limits preclinical and clinical 
experiments. Current purification methods such as ultracentrifugation and 
ultrafiltration are time consuming and do not remove all of the impurities such 
as cellular debris, membrane fragments, and denatured proteins from the 
lentiviruses. The same challenges exist in terms of their analytical 
characterization. Presented here is the novel demonstration of the 
chromatographic isolation of virus particles from culture media based on the 
hydrophobicity characteristics of the vesicles. A method was developed to 
isolate lentivirus from media using a hydrophobic interaction chromatography 
(HIC) method performed on a polyester, capillary-channeled polymer (PET C-CP) 
stationary phase and a standard liquid chromatography apparatus. The method is 
an extension of the approach developed in this laboratory for the isolation of 
extracellular vesicles (EVs). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was 
used to verify and quantify lentiviruses in elution fractions. Load and elution 
mobile phase compositions were optimized to affect high efficiency and 
throughput. The process has been visualized via scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) of the fiber surfaces following media injection, the elution of 
proteinaceous material, and the elution of lentiviruses. This effort has yielded 
a rapid (<10 min), low-cost (< $15 per column, providing multiple separations), 
and efficient method for the isolation/purification of lentivirus particles from 
cell culture media at the analytical scale.

INTRODUCTION: Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and Anterior Cruciate 
Ligament (ACL) injuries are both prevalent in sport. It is currently unknown 
whether DOMS increases ACL injury risk.
AIM: This study aimed to provide preliminary insight on whether DOMS affects ACL 
injury risk by investigating whether DOMS affects the biomechanical variables of 
the DVJ that have been identified as risk factors for future ACL injury.
METHODS: This was a randomised control trial involving 32 active individuals 
aged 18-35 years, with no history of ACL injury. Participants underwent two 
sessions of force-plate testing and 3D motion analysis of the drop vertical jump 
(DVJ). The DVJ was chosen as it has been investigated prospectively for 
association with future ACL injury. Initial testing was followed by 
randomisation to DOMS or control group. The DOMS group underwent a DOMS-inducing 
exercise protocol, the control group did not. Both groups were re-tested 48 h 
after initial testing. Five variables of the DVJ that have been associated with 
future ACL injury were chosen for analysis - peak knee flexion angle, peak 
vertical ground reaction force, ground contact time, peak knee abduction angle & 
peak knee abduction moment. Between-group differences were compared using a 
two-way mixed analysis of variance; alpha level set to 0.05.
RESULTS: DOMS was successfully induced in all participants of the DOMS group 
however no statistically significant group x time interactions were found for 
any of the five variables analysed.
CONCLUSIONS: DOMS did not affect the biomechanical variables of the DVJ that 
have been associated with future ACL injury. By extension, this may suggest that 
DOMS might not affect ACL injury risk. However, it is also possible that certain 
attributes of the DVJ meant that any effect of DOMS was simply unable to be 
quantified, even if an effect existed. All considered, our position is that 
conclusion cannot be drawn from this study alone on whether DOMS affects ACL 
injury risk. Further research is required.

Alginate is the structural polysaccharide of the cell wall of brown algae, which 
is an important carbon source for marine life. The depolymerization of alginate 
is dependent on alginate lyases. Recent studies showed that the alginate 
utilization ability had been obtained by human gut microbes. In contrast to the 
great number of studies on alginate lyases from marine/soil organisms, studies 
on alginate lyases from gut microbes are still limited. Here, the structure of a 
polysaccharide lyase family 6 (PL6) alginate lyase from human gut microbe 
Bacteroides clarus was solved by X-ray crystallography, which represents the 
cluster of two-domain PL6 alginate lyases from Bacteroidetes. Similar with the 
two-domain alginate lyase AlyGC originated from marine bacterium, both the N 
terminal domain (NTD) and C terminal domain (CTD) of BcAlyPL6 show right-handed 
parallel β-helix fold. However, unlike AlyGC, which forms a homodimer, BcAlyPL6 
functions as a monomer. Biochemical analysis indicates that the substrate 
binding affinity is mainly contributed by the NTD while the CTD of BcAlyPL6 is 
involved in the formation of -1 subsite, which is essential for substrate 
turnover rate. Furthermore, CTD is involved in shaping a closed catalytic 
pocket, and deletion of it leads to increased activity towards highly 
polymerized substrate. Structure comparison of PL6 family alginate lyases 
implies that the linkers of two-domain alginate lyases might have evolutionary 
relationship with the N/C terminal extension of single-domain lyases.

INTRODUCTION: Severe neutropenia is a dose-limiting factor that occurs in up to 
82% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
treated with cabazitaxel. This study evaluated the effectiveness of granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) plus ciprofloxacin as prophylaxis in 
post-docetaxel patients with mCRPC treated with cabazitaxel and at high risk for 
neutropenia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a phase IV, multicenter, open-label, single-arm 
interventional study with men aged ≥ 65 years (or < 65 years and ≥ 25% 
irradiated bone marrow), presenting with mCRPC after docetaxel failure, 
performance status ≤ 1, and life expectancy > 12 weeks. Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 and 
prednisone were given on day 1, every 21 days. G-CSF was administered on days 2 
to 8 of each cycle or until an absolute neutrophil count > 2000/mm3, and 
ciprofloxacin 1000 mg was given orally on days 5 to 12. The rate of neutropenia 
grade ≥ 3 during the first cycle (primary endpoint), and frequency of 
neutropenia grade ≥ 3, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea grade ≥ 3, 
prostate-specific antigen response, and quality of life during treatment 
(secondary end points) were estimated.
RESULTS: We included 46 patients. The mean number of cabazitaxel cycles was 9.5. 
During the first cycle, 40.0% of patients had neutropenia grade ≥ 3, and 42.2% 
had at least 1 episode of neutropenia during treatment. Febrile neutropenia and 
diarrhea grade ≥ 3 occurred in 1 patient each. Twenty-nine (64.4%) patients 
achieved prostate-specific antigen response, and 77.2% improved quality of life 
scores in at least 1 visit.
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic G-CSF was effective in preventing neutropenia grade ≥ 
3 and other hematologic complications during treatment with cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 
in post-docetaxel patients with mCRPC at high risk for neutropenia. The role of 
prophyclatic ciprofloxacin to prevent febrile neutropenia in this setting is 
still unclear and needs to be further evaluated.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) is an important consideration in the clinical 
decision-making for T1aN0M0 renal cell cancer (RCC) patients.
OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of race/ethnicity (Caucasian, African American, 
Hispanic/Latino, and Asian) on LE predictions from Social Security 
Administration (SSA) life tables in male and female T1aN0M0 RCC patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We relied on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results database.
INTERVENTION: Radical nephrectomy (RN) and partial nephrectomy (PN).
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Five-year and 10-yr observed 
overall survival (OS) of pT1aN0M0 RCC patients treated between 2004 and 2006 
were compared with the LE predicted from SSA life tables. We repeated the 
comparison in a more contemporary cohort (2009-2011), with 5-yr follow-up and 
higher PN rates.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In the 2004-2006 cohort, PN rate was 40.7%. OS followed 
the predicted LE in Caucasians, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asians, but not in 
African Americans, in whom 5-yr OS rates were 5.0% (male) and 8.7% (female) and 
10-yr rates were 4.2% (male) and 11.1% (female) lower than predicted. In the 
2009-2011 cohort, PN rate was 59.4%. Same observations were made for OS versus 
predicted LE in Caucasians, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asians. In African Americans, 
5-yr OS rates were 1.5% (male) and 4.9% (female) lower than predicted.
CONCLUSIONS: In RN- or PN-treated pT1aN0M0 RCC patients, LE predictions closely 
approximated OS of Caucasians, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asians. In 
African-American patients, SSA life tables overestimated LE, more in females 
than in males. The limitations of our study are its retrospective nature, its 
validity for US patients only, and the under-representation of racial/ethnic 
minorities.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Social Security Administration life tables can be used to 
estimate long-term life expectancy in patients who are surgically treated for 
renal cancer (≤4 cm). However, while for Caucasians, Hispanics/Latinos, and 
Asians, the prediction performs well, life expectancy of African Americans is 
generally overestimated by life table predictions. TAKE  HOME MESSAGE: In the 
clinical decision-making process for T1aN0M0 renal cell cancer patients eligible 
for radical or partial nephrectomy, the important influence of patient sex and 
race/ethnicity on life expectancy should be taken into account, when using 
Social Security Administration life tables.

The growing life expectancy in modern societies has raised scientific interest 
in identifying medical interventions to alleviate age-associated pathologies 
such as vascular calcification, cognitive decline, sarcopenia, osteoporosis and 
sexual dysfunction. Although no such single treatment has thus far been 
established in humans, some clinicians and patients have set their hopes on 
testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) as a potential "fountain of youth" for 
aging men. While TRT has proven effective in ameliorating distinct symptoms of 
late-onset hypogonadism (LOH), its safety remains to be demonstrated. Besides 
humans, multiple other species exhibit age-related reductions in circulating 
testosterone levels, raising the question whether such changes are an inherent, 
pathological feature of growing organismal age or rather reflect an adaptive 
response. In this manuscript, we apply key principles of evolutionary medicine 
to testosterone biology and LOH to provide a novel perspective on these two 
fields. Additionally, we discuss insightful data derived from the animal kingdom 
to illustrate the plasticity of individual testosterone trajectories across the 
lifespan, outline cost-benefit-considerations of TRT in LOH and highlight 
potential caveats of such therapies.

Health technology assessment (HTA) of clinical and economic value of a new 
intervention is an integral step in providing the access of patients to 
innovative cancer care and treatment. Overall survival (OS) is the preferred 
criterion for demonstrating the therapeutic efficacy in HTA given its direct 
clinical and patient relevance. However, with often long life expectancy of 
patients with early cancer, analysis of OS becomes less practical. Partially due 
to this reason, pathological complete response (pCR) and time-to-event 
end-points like disease-free survival are frequently incorporated into the 
pivotal clinical trials in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. However, there 
exists a discrepancy between different national HTA bodies regarding the 
acknowledgement of patient relevance of these end-points. In this article, we 
analysed the perspectives of patients on different aspects of end-points used in 
clinical trials in early cancer. Gathered evidence strongly suggests that 
complete tumour eradication and reduced risk of recurrence provide important 
psychological benefits thus signifying that pCR and time-to-event end-points are 
directly relevant to patients. Additionally, we reviewed opinions on patient 
relevance of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy end-points adopted by HTA bodies 
during the recent evaluations. We found that improvements in end-points used in 
the adjuvant setting were commonly considered as valuable to patients. In 
contrast, opinions on patient relevance of neoadjuvant therapy end-points varied 
between the national HTA bodies. Universal acknowledgement of patient relevance 
of therapeutic end-points for early cancer by HTA bodies is necessary to balance 
the inequality in uptake of innovative therapies into national healthcare 
systems.

BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of the pandemic, humanitarian medicine has 
been discontinued. Until now, there have been no general recommendations on how 
humanitarian surgical missions should be organized.
METHODS: Based on our experience in the field of humanitarian surgical missions 
to Sub-Saharan Africa, a panel of recommendations in times of COVID-19 was 
developed. The fields under study were as follows: (1) Planning of a 
multidisciplinary project; (2) Organization of the infrastructure; (3) 
Screening, management and treatment of SARS-COV-2; (4) Diagnostic tests for 
SARS-COV-2; (5) Surgical priorization and (6) Context of patients during 
health-care assistance. We applied a risk bias measurement to obtain a consensus 
among humanitarian health-care providers with experience in this field.
RESULTS: A total of 94.36% of agreement were reached for the approval of the 
recommendations. Emergency surgery must be a priority, and elective surgery 
adapted. For emergency surgery, we established a priority level 1a (< 24 h) and 
1b (< 72 h). For an elective procedure, according our American College of 
Surgeon adaptation score, process with more than 60 points should be 
reconsidered. Due to the low life expectancy in many African countries, we 
consider 45-50 years as age of risk. In case of SARS-COV-2 active infection or 
high clinical suspicion, the screening, management and treatment should be 
following the international guidelines adapted to duration of the stay, 
available infrastructure, size of the cooperation team and medical resources.
CONCLUSIONS: Humanitarian surgical mission in times of COVID-19 is a challenge 
that must extrapolate the established recommendations to the local cooperation 
environment.

AIM: Patients with recurrent cervical cancer after radiotherapy have poor 
prognoses because of the lack of effective treatment options. Biomarkers to 
predict survival outcomes for recurrent cervical cancer are warranted because 
patients with limited life expectancy sometimes benefit from less aggressive 
treatment in combination with early palliative care. Therefore, we aimed to 
explore a predictive biomarker for the outcomes of patients with recurrent 
cervical cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 231 patients initially treated with 
radiation-based therapy between January 2004 and December 2015. The associations 
between clinicopathological features at the time of relapse and overall survival 
after relapse were assessed. As factors which reflect patients' conditions, we 
particularly focused on C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) and 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at the time of relapse. Additionally, we 
investigated biomarkers predictive of short-term survival.
RESULTS: Among 231 patients, 91 patients experienced relapse and 74 patients 
died during the follow-up period. Multivariate analysis revealed that treatment 
after relapse, CAR, and NLR was significantly associated with overall survival. 
Among them, treatment after relapse significantly affected survival outcomes, 
and patients who received definitive local treatment had a better 3-year 
survival rate than those who received other treatments. Conversely, NLR was the 
most influential biomarker for short-term survival, and the prognosis of 
patients with high NLRs was much worse than those with low NLRs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study thus demonstrated that, for the patients with recurrent 
cervical cancer who received radiation-based therapy, definitive local treatment 
can provide long-term survival and extremely high NLRs are predictive of 
short-term survival.

IMPORTANCE: Injuries have been a major cause of premature mortality and 
short-term and long-term disability in Mexico.
OBJECTIVE: To report the findings from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study 
on injuries in Mexico at a national and subnational scale from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Following the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study we examined injury 
mortality, premature mortality, years lived with disability and 
disability-adjusted life-years according to 14 subcategories. We calculated the 
Pearson correlation coefficient between the injury burden and the 
socio-demographic index.
RESULTS: While the number of deaths from injuries increased significantly, the 
changes in the age-standardized mortality rates trended towards declines. 
Interpersonal violence, road injuries, falls and self-harm accounted for 8 of 
every 10 deaths from injury in 2019. Injury mortality and the 
disability-adjusted life-years rates decreased nationally and in most states in 
the period as a whole, but have increased since 2007. The injury burden was 
higher for men in all age groups. Interpersonal violence caused the highest 
disability-adjusted life-years rate in males and road injuries in females. The 
socio-demographic index increased in all states, while the injury 
age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years rates between 1990 and 2019 
decreased, but there was no statistical association between both indicators.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study represents a comprehensive review of 
injury burden of disease in Mexico. The injury burden decreased, but improved 
heterogeneously among states. To further reduce the injury burden of disease, 
it's necessary for federal, state and local governments to prioritize safety 
promotion and injury prevention programs, infrastructure improvements, 
legislation, and enforcement at a national and subnational level. Mexico's 
injury prevention efforts should also be tailored for specific age groups, such 
as males aged 20-49 years or females in the younger and older age groups, and 
high-burden areas.

BACKGROUND: Stroke-like syndrome is defined as a rare, delayed complication of 
brain oncotherapy. Cases with more favorable brain cancer diagnoses and longer 
life expectancy have been previously reported, but here we present, for the 
first time, three long-term survivors of glioblastoma with stroke-like 
syndromes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Three young or middle-aged patients underwent tumor 
resection and chemoradiotherapy. They received regular clinical and imaging 
follow-up with stable neurological status and no signs of tumor recurrence. They 
exhibited varied signs and symptoms (motor and sensory deficits, aphasia, memory 
and cognitive disorders, seizures, and headache) accompanied by imaging 
abnormalities. Stroke-like syndromes developed within 2-5 days and resolved in 
2-6 weeks. Diffusion-weighted MRI and T2 brain perfusion abnormalities were 
demonstrated in all patients. In addition, there was focal T1 MRI contrast 
enhancement due to blood-brain barrier disruption. In addition to tumor 
recurrence, classic stroke, encephalitis, metabolic and mitochondrial disorders, 
and post-seizure swelling should be excluded. The imaging indicated intensive 
MRI scanning and symptomatic medication (steroids supplemented by 
antiepileptics, vasoactive agents, etc.) for judicious management. With respect 
to the course, an invasive procedure was still considered an option.
CONCLUSION: All stroke-like syndromes are diagnoses of exclusion. To avoid 
misinterpretation of imaging findings as glioblastoma recurrence and avert 
recall oncotherapy or redundant interventions, better understanding of delayed 
complications of brain tumor therapy is crucial.

Amid growing concern regarding the potential added burden of care due to 
population aging, we have very little understanding of what is the burden of 
care in aging populations. To answer this question, we introduce a novel metric
