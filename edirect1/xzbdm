Stroke is not only a leading cause of death worldwide but also a main cause of 
disability. In developing countries, its burden is increasing as a consequence 
of a higher life expectancy. Whereas stroke mortality has decreased in developed 
countries, in Latin America, stroke mortality rates continue to rise as well as 
its socioeconomic dramatic consequences. Therefore, it is necessary to implement 
stroke care and surveillance programs to better describe the epidemiology of 
stroke in these countries in order to improve therapeutic strategies. Advances 
in the understanding of the pathogenic processes of brain ischemia have resulted 
in development of effective therapies during the acute phase. These include 
reperfusion therapies (both intravenous thrombolysis and interventional 
endovascular approaches) and treatment in stroke units that, through application 
of management protocols directed to maintain homeostasis and avoid 
complications, helps to exert effective brain protection that decreases further 
cerebral damage. Some drugs may enhance protection, and besides, there is 
increasing knowledge about brain plasticity and repair mechanisms that take 
place for longer periods beyond the acute phase. These mechanisms are 
responsible for recovery in certain patients and are the focus of basic and 
clinical research at present. This paper discusses recovery strategies that have 
demonstrated clinical effect, or that are promising and need further study. This 
rapidly evolving field needs to be carefully and critically evaluated so that 
investment in patient care is grounded on well-proven strategies.

Advance directives, dementia, and physician-assisted death.

Menzel PT(1), Steinbock B.

Physician-assisted suicide laws in Oregon and Washington require the person's 
current competency and a prognosis of terminal illness. In The Netherlands 
voluntariness and unbearable suffering are required for euthanasia. Many people 
are more concerned about the loss of autonomy and independence in years of 
severe dementia than about pain and suffering in their last months. To address 
this concern, people could write advance directives for physician-assisted death 
in dementia. Should such directives be implemented even though, at the time, the 
person is no longer competent and would not be either terminally ill or 
suffering unbearably? We argue that in many cases they should be, and that a 
sliding scale which considers both autonomy and the capacity for enjoyment 
provides the best justification for determining when: when written by a 
previously well-informed and competent person, such a directive gains in 
authority as the later person's capacities to generate new critical interests 
and to enjoy life decrease. Such an extension of legalized death assistance is 
grounded in the same central value of voluntariness that undergirds the current 
more limited legalization.

Hypothesis: the reversal of the relation between economic growth and health 
progress in Sweden in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was caused by 
electrification.

The expected decline of health indicators with economic recessions and 
improvement with economic growth in the nineteenth century Sweden was reversed 
in the twentieth century, giving the counterintuitive pattern of higher 
mortality and lower life expectancy in economic expansions and improvement of 
these indices in recessions. The change or "tipping point" occurred at the end 
of the nineteenth century or early in the twentieth century when electrification 
was introduced into Sweden. All 5 of the reversals of annual industrial electric 
energy use in the US between 1912 and 1970 were accompanied by recessions with 
lowered GDP, increased unemployment, decreased mortality and increased life 
expectancy. The health indices were not related to residential electricity use. 
The mortality improvement between 1931 and 1932 by state in the US strongly 
favored urban areas over rural areas. Rural unemployment by state in 1930 was 
significantly positively correlated with residential electrification percentage 
by state in 1930. The health effects of economic change are mediated by 
electrical exposure.

management of chemotherapy-related acute and delayed nausea: Assessment of 
Nausea in Chemotherapy Research (ANCHoR), a randomised controlled trial.

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting remain difficult symptoms 
to manage in clinical practice. As standard antiemetic drugs do not fully 
eliminate these symptoms, it is important to explore the adjuvant role of 
non-pharmacological and complementary therapies in antiemetic management 
approaches. Acupressure is one such treatment showing highly suggestive evidence 
so far of a positive effect, meriting further investigation.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of self-acupressure using wristbands compared with sham 
acupressure wristbands and standard care alone in the management of 
chemotherapy-induced nausea. Secondary objectives included assessment of the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the wristbands in relation to vomiting 
and quality of life and exploration of any age, gender and emetogenic risk 
effects.
DESIGN: Randomised three-arm sham-controlled trial (Assessment of Nausea in 
Chemotherapy Research or ANCHoR) with an economic evaluation. Arms include the 
wristband arm, the sham wristband arm and the standard care only arm. 
Randomisation consisted of minimisation with a random element balancing for 
gender, age (16-24, > 24-50, >50 years) and three levels of emetogenic 
chemotherapy (low, moderate and high). Qualitative interviews were incorporated 
to shed more light on the quantitative findings.
SETTING: Outpatient chemotherapy clinics in three regions in the UK involving 14 
different cancer units/centres.
PARTICIPANTS: Chemotherapy-naive cancer patients receiving chemotherapy of low, 
moderate and high emetogenic risk.
INTERVENTION: The intervention was acupressure wristbands pressing the P6 point 
(anterior surface of the forearm).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Rhodes Index for Nausea/Vomiting, the Multinational 
Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) Antiemesis Tool and the 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G). At baseline 
participants completed measures of anxiety/depression, nausea/vomiting 
expectation and expectations from using the wristbands.
RESULTS: In total, 500 patients were randomised in the study arms (166 standard 
care, 166 sham acupressure and 168 acupressure) and data were available for 361 
participants for the primary outcome. The primary outcome analysis (nausea in 
cycle 1) revealed no statistically significant differences between the three 
arms, although the median nausea experience in patients using wristbands (both 
real and sham ones) was somewhat lower than that in the antiemetics only group 
(median nausea experience scores for the four cycles: standard care arm 1.43, 
1.71, 1.14, 1.14; sham acupressure arm 0.57, 0.71, 0.71, 0.43; acupressure arm 
1.00, 0.93, 0.43, 0). A gender effect was evident (p= 0.002), with women 
responding more favourably to the use of sham acupressure wristbands than men 
(odds ratio 0.35 for men and 2.02 for women in the sham acupressure group; 1.27 
for men and 1.17 for women in the acupressure group). This suggests a placebo 
effect. No significant differences were detected in relation to vomiting 
outcomes, anxiety and quality of life. Some transient adverse effects were 
reported, including tightness in the area of the wristbands, feeling 
uncomfortable when wearing them and minor swelling in the wristband area (n= 
6).There were no statistically significant cost differences associated with the 
use of real acupressure bands (£70.66 for the acupressure group, £111.13 for the 
standard care group and £161.92 for the sham acupressure group). In total, 26 
subjects took part in qualitative interviews. The qualitative data suggested 
that participants perceived the wristbands (both real and sham) as effective and 
helpful in managing their nausea during chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistically significant differences between the 
three arms in terms of nausea, vomiting and quality of life, although apparent 
resource use was less in both the real acupressure arm and the sham acupressure 
arm compared with standard care only; therefore; no clear conclusions can be 
drawn about the use of acupressure wristbands in the management of 
chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting. However, the study provided 
encouraging evidence in relation to an improved nausea experience and some 
indications of possible cost savings to warrant further consideration of 
acupressure both in practice and in further clinical trials.

Increasing life expectancy over the past half century results in higher demand 
for healthcare of the aging population, therefore adapting the health system to 
the needs. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is high in the elderly, 
especially for depression. Several studies have shown that twenty percent of 
elderly residents of public facilities meet the criteria for major depressive 
episode. Depression is a major burden in the elderly, with increased risk of 
suicide, impaired quality of life and functional autonomy, consequences on 
somatic morbidity and elevated mortality rates. It is thus necessary to find out 
how to improve physicians' abilities to detect and treat depression in older 
adults. Moreover, use of psychotropic drugs is frequent and increases the risk 
of injury in this population more vulnerable to drug effects. It is also 
necessary to develop specific gerontopsychiatric wards in large general 
hospitals and nursing homes.

Sciences, Sendai, Japan. daichan@m.tohoku.ac.jp

Behavioral changes in evolution have attracted the attention of many 
evolutionary biologists. Closely related species, or even individuals from 
different populations within a species, often exhibit remarkably different 
behaviors. Such behavioral diversification has been implicated as a cause of 
speciation in some cases, yet the mechanisms that produce and maintain these 
changes remain largely unknown. Drosophila melanogaster, an outstanding model 
organism with which to explore the causal link among the gene, neural circuitry, 
and behavior, provides an excellent entry point for a comparative approach to 
the origin of behavioral diversification with a single-gene and single-cell 
resolution. Here we survey studies that attempted to reveal the mechanistic 
bases for behavioral changes potentially associated with speciation, and we 
discuss the successfully identified candidate genes or neurons involved in such 
events. Although evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo), a field devoted 
to the developmental and molecular basis of phenotypic diversity, has mostly 
been focused on morphological traits, the extension of this evo-devo approach to 
behavioral diversity will provide a comprehensive understanding of the 
genome-environment interactions underlying adaptive evolution.

OBJECTIVE: Pneumococcal disease is a significant problem in immunocompromised 
persons, particularly in HIV-infected individuals. The CDC recently updated 
pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for immunocompromised adults, adding 
the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) to the previously 
recommended 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). This 
analysis estimates the cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination strategies 
in HIV-infected individuals and in the broader immunocompromised adult group.
DESIGN: Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: The model considered immunocompromised persons aged 19-64 years and 
accounted for childhood PCV13 herd immunity; in a separate analysis, an 
HIV-infected subgroup was considered. PCV13 effectiveness was estimated by an 
expert panel; PPSV23 protection was modeled relative to PCV13 effectiveness. We 
assumed that both vaccines prevented invasive pneumococcal disease, but only 
PCV13 prevented nonbacteremic pneumonia.
RESULTS: In all immunocompromised individuals, a single PCV13 cost $70,937 per 
quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to no vaccination; current 
recommendations cost $136,724/QALY. In HIV patients, with a longer life 
expectancy (22.5 years), current recommendations cost $89,391/QALY compared to a 
single PCV13. Results were sensitive to variation of life expectancy and vaccine 
effectiveness. The prior recommendation was not favored in any scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: One dose of PCV13 is more cost-effective for immunocompromised 
individuals than previous vaccination recommendations and may be more 
economically reasonable than current recommendations, depending on life 
expectancy and vaccine effectiveness in the immunocompromised.

Massive bilateral pressure ulcers of dependent areas may complicate spinal cord 
injuries. These may be life threatening to patients and challenging for 
reconstructive surgeons. In massive recurrent ulcers, local tissue is either 
inadequate or previously exhausted. The total thigh musculocutaneous flap is an 
operation of last resort; we present a new variation of this procedure and a 
case of life threatening pressure ulcers with underlying osteomyelitis. A 
paraplegic patient had recurrent, extensive, bilateral pressure areas with some 
preserved tissue bridges. The nature of the pressure areas and lack of local 
options in this patient required modification of previously described total 
thigh flaps. An extended total thigh flap was partially de-epithelialised to 
fill the extensive sacral defect and a tunnelled extension was fashioned to 
cover the contralateral trochanteric defect. The timing of surgery was 
determined by balancing pre-operative nutritional optimisation against 
life-threatening drug resistance of infective organisms. The total thigh flap 
can close massive bilateral pressure ulcers. Modifications are presented which 
preserve viable local tissue and demonstrate the versatility of this technique. 
It remains a 'last-resort' salvage procedure.

A novel method to value real options in health care: the case of a multicohort 
human papillomavirus vaccination strategy.

London, United Kingdom. g.favato@kingston.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: A large number of economic evaluations have already confirmed the 
cost-effectiveness of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination 
strategies. Standard analyses might not capture the full economic value of novel 
vaccination programs because the cost-effectiveness paradigm fails to take into 
account the value of active management. Management decisions can be seen as real 
options, a term used to refer to the application of option pricing theory to the 
valuation of investments in nonfinancial assets in which much of the value is 
attributable to flexibility and learning over time.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to discuss the potential advantages shown 
by using the payoff method in the valuation of the cost-effectiveness of 
competing HPV immunization programs.
METHODS: This was the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to use the 
payoff method to determine the real option values of 4 different HPV vaccination 
strategies targeting female subjects aged 12, 15, 18, and 25 years. The payoff 
method derives the real option value from the triangular payoff distribution of 
the project's net present value, which is treated as a triangular fuzzy number. 
To inform the real option model, cost-effectiveness data were derived from an 
empirically calibrated Bayesian model designed to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of a multicohort HPV vaccination strategy in the context of the current cervical 
cancer screening program in Italy. A net health benefit approach was used to 
calculate the expected fuzzy net present value for each of the 4 vaccination 
strategies evaluated.
RESULTS: Costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained seemed to be related to the 
number of cohorts targeted: a single cohort of girls aged 12 years (€10,955 [95% 
CI, -1,021 to 28,212]) revealed the lowest cost among the 4 alternative 
strategies evaluated. The real option valuation challenged the 
cost-effectiveness dominance of a single cohort of 12-year-old girls. The 
simultaneous vaccination of 2 cohorts of girls aged 12 and 15 years yielded a 
real option value (€17,723) equivalent to that attributed to a single cohort of 
12-year-old girls (€17,460).
CONCLUSIONS: The payoff method showed distinctive advantages in the valuation of 
the cost-effectiveness of competing health care interventions, essentially 
determined by the replacement of the nonfuzzy numbers that are commonly used in 
cost-effectiveness analysis models, with fuzzy numbers as an input to inform the 
real option pricing method. The real option approach to value uncertainty makes 
policy making in health care an evolutionary process and creates a new "space" 
for decision-making choices.

Cost-effectiveness for acupuncture in seasonal allergic rhinitis: economic 
results of the ACUSAR trial.

University Medical Center, Berlin, Germany. thomas.reinhold@charite.de

BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a frequent allergic disorder with a 
significant economic effect on health care costs and productivity.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture for patients with 
seasonal AR (SAR) in Germany.
METHODS: The present analysis was part of the Acupuncture in Seasonal Allergic 
Rhinitis (ACUSAR) trial, a 3-arm randomized, controlled, multicenter trial in 
patients with SAR, comparing acupuncture plus rescue medication (RM), 
penetrating sham acupuncture plus RM, and a control group receiving RM alone. 
Measures for health economic analyses were costs and health-related quality of 
life. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for different 
scenarios on the duration of acupuncture effects and was expressed as costs per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. The study was conducted from society's and 
from a third-party payer's perspective.
RESULTS: From 422 initially randomized patients, a total of 364 patients with 
complete data on costs and quality of life were included in the health economic 
evaluation. Patients receiving acupuncture or sham acupuncture caused higher 
costs than patients in the RM group. Patients in the acupuncture group gained 
significantly more quality-adjusted life-years compared with the RM group. 
Depending on different scenarios, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
acupuncture patients was between €31,241 (approximately US $38.569) and €118,889 
(approximately US $146,777) from society's perspective and between €20,807 
(approximately US $25,688) and €74,585 (approximately US $92.080) from a 
third-party payer's perspective.
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture is an effective intervention that results in improved 
quality of life in patients with SAR. However, in times of limited resources for 
health care, acupuncture for AR may not be a cost-effective intervention.

Health of children in Jamaica: the new health realities.

Bourne PA(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Community Health and Psychiatry, Faculty of Medical Sciences, 
University of the West Indies, Mona, Kingston, Jamaica. paulbourne1@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization developed a mathematical technique, 
which discount the life expectancy by the years spent in disability or 
morbidity. Health, therefore, must be more than morbidity as it expands to 
quality of life. It is within this framework that a study on childhood health in 
Jamaica is of vital importance.
OBJECTIVES: To (1) expand the health literature in Jamaica and by extension the 
Caribbean, (2) understand the status of child health outside of mortality, (3) 
aid public health practitioners with research, upon which they are able to 
further improve the quality of life of children by adding quality to their lived 
years, (4) investigate the age at with children in Jamaica become influenced by 
chronic disease, it typology, and (5) evaluate the subjective wellbeing of 
children as is done for the general populace and elderly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study extracted a sample of 8,373 and 2,104 
children 0-14 years from two surveys. Descriptive statistics were used to 
analyze the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample. Data were analyzed 
using Chi-square and analysis of variance and independent sample t-test.
RESULTS: The current study found that a shift in health condition was noticed in 
2007 over 2002. The number of children who had diarrhea fell by 84.2% in 2007 
over 2002, and a similar reduction was observed for those with asthma (42.1% in 
2002 and 19.7% in 2007). Another critical finding was that 1.2% of children, in 
2007, had diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSION: Public health now has an epidemiological profile of health 
conditions of children and the demographic shifts, which are occurring, and this 
can be used for effective management and planning of the new health reality of 
the Jamaican child.

A right antenna for social behaviour in honeybees.

Sophisticated cognitive abilities have been documented in honeybees, possibly an 
aspect of their complex sociality. In vertebrates brain asymmetry enhances 
cognition and directional biases of brain function are a putative adaptation to 
social behaviour. Here we show that honeybees display a strong lateral 
preference to use their right antenna in social interactions. Dyads of bees 
tested using only their right antennae (RA) contacted after shorter latency and 
were significantly more likely to interact positively (proboscis extension) than 
were dyads of bees using only their left antennae (LA). The latter were more 
likely to interact negatively (C-responses) even though they were from the same 
hive. In dyads from different hives C-responses were higher in RA than LA dyads. 
Hence, RA controls social behaviour appropriate to context. Therefore, in 
invertebrates, as well as vertebrates, lateral biases in behaviour appear to be 
associated with requirements of social life.

Does health promote economic growth? Portuguese case study: from dictatorship to 
full democracy.

Morgado SM(1).

Author information:

de Ciências Policiais e Segurança Interna (ISCPSI), Lisbon, Portugal, 
soniamamorgado@gmail.com.

This paper revisits the debate on health and economic growth (Deaton in J Econ 
Lit 51:113-158, 2003) focusing on the Portuguese case by testing the 
relationship between growth and health. We test Portuguese insights, using time 
series data from 1960 to 2005, taking into account different variables (life 
expectancy, labour, capital, infant mortality) and considering the years that 
included major events on the political scene, such as the dictatorship and a 
closed economy (1960-1974), a revolution (1974) and full democracy and an open 
economy (1975-2005), factors that influence major economic, cultural, social and 
politic indicators. Therefore the analysis is carried out adopting Lucas' (J 
Monet Econ 22(1):3-42, 1988) endogenous growth model that considers human 
capital as one factor of production, it adopts a VAR (vector autoregressive) 
model to test the causality between growth and health. Estimates based on the 
VAR seem to confirm that economic growth influences the health process, but 
health does not promote growth, during the period under study.

OBJECTIVE: The transplantation of a cadaveric donor pancreas represents a 
therapeutic option for the type 1 diabetic. A precondition is the proof of 
negative serum C-peptide after glucagon stimulation (< 0.02 ng/ml) as it is 
found in the typical patient with type 1 or a pancreoprive diabetes. The 
pancreas can be transplanted alone (PTA) or after a kidney (PAK), either 
following a preceding living related or cadaveric kidney transplantation. The 
majority of pancreata worldwide are transplanted simultaneously with a kidney 
(SPK) in stage 4 and 5 (eGFR < 29 ml/min) of chronic kidney disease. The 
beneficial effect of physiological glucose regulation on mortality, kidney 
failure and diabetic complications (cardiovascular, neuropathy, retinopathy) is 
well established. Patient survival rate at 1 year after transplantation is above 
90 %, pancreas graft survival overall after 1 year is about 80 %.
INDICATIONS: Type 1 diabetic patients with recurrent hypoglycemic episodes or 
major complications due to dysregulated glucose metabolism qualify for pancreas 
transplantation alone in case of a stable kidney function. Patients with chronic 
kidney disease stage 4 and 5 are candidates for SPK.
PROCEDURE: Pancreatic transplantation into the right iliac fossa.
CONCLUSION: Although technically demanding, pancreas transplantation is safely 
performable with a low periprocedural morbidity and mortality. Potential 
perioperative complications include inflammation, rejection or graft thrombosis. 
After a successful transplantation, long-term physiological glucose regulation 
can be achieved which results in a prolonged life expectancy and quality of life 
in type 1 diabetic patients.

Competing risks model time to first event and type of first event. An example 
from hospital epidemiology is the incidence of hospital-acquired infection, 
which has to account for hospital discharge of non-infected patients as a 
competing risk. An illness-death model would allow to further study hospital 
outcomes of infected patients. Such a model typically relies on a Markov 
assumption. However, it is conceivable that the future course of an infected 
patient does not only depend on the time since hospital admission and current 
infection status but also on the time since infection. We demonstrate how a 
modified competing risks model can be used for nonparametric estimation of 
transition probabilities when the Markov assumption is violated.

PURPOSE: The Czech Republic is faced with making choices between pharmaceutical 
products, including depot injectable antipsychotics. A pharmacoeconomic analysis 
was conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness of atypical depots.
METHODS: An existing 1-year decision-analytic framework was adapted to model 
drug use in this healthcare system. The average direct costs to the General 
Insurance Company of the Czech Republic of using paliperidone palmitate 
(Xeplion®), risperidone (Risperdal Consta®), and olanzapine pamoate (Zypadhera®) 
were determined. Literature-derived clinical rates populated the model, with 
costs adjusted to 2012 Euros using the consumer price index. Outcomes included 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), days in remission, and proportions 
hospitalized or visiting emergency rooms. One-way sensitivity analyses were 
calculated for all important inputs. A multivariate probability analysis was 
used to examine the stability of results using 10,000 iterations of simulated 
input over reasonable ranges of all included variables.
RESULTS: Expected average costs/per patient treated were €5377 for PP-LAI, €6118 
for RIS-LAI, and €6537 for OLZ-LAI. Respective QALYs were 0.817, 0.809, and 
0.811; ER visits were 0.127, 0.134, and 0.141; hospitalizations were 0.252, 
0.298, and 0.289. Results were generally robust in sensitivity analyses. PP-LAI 
dominated RIS-LAI and OLZ-LAI in 90.2% and 92.1% of simulations, respectively. 
Results were insensitive to drug prices but sensitive to adherence and 
hospitalization rates.
CONCLUSIONS: PP-LAI dominated the other two drugs, as it had a lower overall 
cost and superior clinical outcomes, making it the preferred choice. Using 
PP-LAI in place of RIS-LAI for chronic relapsing schizophrenia would reduce the 
overall costs of care for the healthcare system.

Cost-effectiveness of 3-year vs 1-year adjuvant therapy with imatinib in 
patients with high risk of gastrointestinal stromal tumour recurrence in the 
Netherlands; a modelling study alongside the SSGXVIII/AIO trial.

BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) is 
rarely curative in patients at high risk of tumour recurrence and therefore 1 
year of post-surgery adjuvant imatinib therapy has been recommended in this 
sub-group. Recently, adjuvant imatinib therapy administered for 3 years has been 
demonstrated to further increase recurrence-free survival and overall survival. 
The goal of this study was to assess the economic value of extending the 
duration of adjuvant imatinib therapy in high-risk patients in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A multistate Markov model was developed to simulate how patients' 
clinical status after GIST excision evolves over time until death. The model 
structure encompassed four primary health states: free of recurrence, first GIST 
recurrence, second GIST recurrence, and death. Transition probabilities between 
the health states, data on medical care costs, and quality-of-life were obtained 
from published sources and from expert opinion.
RESULTS: The expected number of life years (or quality-adjusted life years, 
QALYs) was higher in the 3-year group than in the 1-year group, 8.91 (6.55) and 
7.04 (5.18) years, respectively. In the 3-year and 1-year group, the expected 
total costs amounted to €120,195 and €79,361, of which, €74,631 (62%) and 
€27,619 (35%) were adjuvant therapy drug costs, respectively. The difference in 
health benefits, that is 1.87 life years or 1.37 QALYs, and costs, €40,835, 
resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of €21,865 per life 
year gained, and €29,872 per QALY gained.
LIMITATIONS: A limitation of the study was inherently related to the uncertainty 
around the predictions of RFS. Scenario analyses were conducted to test the 
sensitivity of different RFS predictions on the results.
CONCLUSIONS: Delayed recurrence due to treatment with longer-term adjuvant 
imatinib therapy represents a cost-effective treatment option with an ICER below 
the generally accepted threshold in the Netherlands.

We investigate the relationship between obesity and survival, and the extent to 
which this relationship varies by socioeconomic status (SES). The underlying 
model is based on the "Pathways to health" framework in which SES affects health 
by modifying the relationship between lifestyles and health. We use data from 
the British Health and Lifestyle Survey (1984-1985) and the longitudinal 
follow-up in June 2009, and run parametric Gompertz survival models to 
investigate the association between obesity and survival, also accounting for 
interactions between obesity and both age and SES. Generally we find that 
obesity is negatively associated with survival, and that SES is positively 
associated with survival, in both men and women. The interactions between 
obesity and SES predict survival among women but not among men. Obesity compared 
with normal weight is associated with a reduction in survival of 3.3, 3.2 and 
2.8 years in men aged 40, 50 and 60 years, respectively. Corresponding numbers 
among women in the lowest SES group are 13.1, 9.7 and 6.1 years, respectively; 
in the highest SES group they are 6.2, 3.1 and 0.1 years, respectively, a 
difference of approximately 6 years between the highest and lowest SES groups.

Two nursing professors from a small Canadian university provided a leadership 
role in a curriculum review of an environmental health technology program in 
Zambia. The combined health and education experience of these two professionals 
was the optimal fit to help guide and facilitate the curriculum review. This 
review was part of a larger project that had the ultimate goal of improving 
environmental management in rural and peri-urban communities in order to reduce 
infant and under-five mortality rates, thereby addressing three of the UN 
Millennium Development Goals. Participants from two post-secondary educational 
institutions in Zambia and a non-governmental organization spent five days 
together reviewing the theoretical and practical components of the program. 
Theoretical content, practice opportunities and demonstrable student 
competencies were updated within existing resources. The collegiality and 
respect among the participants from many disciplines provided the basis for a 
positive experience in intersectoral collaboration and global health.

Turkey has successfully introduced health system changes and provided its 
citizens with the right to health to achieve universal health coverage, which 
helped to address inequities in financing, health service access, and health 
outcomes. We trace the trajectory of health system reforms in Turkey, with a 
particular emphasis on 2003-13, which coincides with the Health Transformation 
Program (HTP). The HTP rapidly expanded health insurance coverage and access to 
health-care services for all citizens, especially the poorest population groups, 
to achieve universal health coverage. We analyse the contextual drivers that 
shaped the transformations in the health system, explore the design and 
implementation of the HTP, identify the factors that enabled its success, and 
investigate its effects. Our findings suggest that the HTP was instrumental in 
achieving universal health coverage to enhance equity substantially, and led to 
quantifiable and beneficial effects on all health system goals, with an improved 
level and distribution of health, greater fairness in financing with better 
financial protection, and notably increased user satisfaction. After the HTP, 
five health insurance schemes were consolidated to create a unified General 
Health Insurance scheme with harmonised and expanded benefits. Insurance 
coverage for the poorest population groups in Turkey increased from 2·4 million 
people in 2003, to 10·2 million in 2011. Health service access increased across 
the country-in particular, access and use of key maternal and child health 
services improved to help to greatly reduce the maternal mortality ratio, and 
under-5, infant, and neonatal mortality, especially in socioeconomically 
disadvantaged groups. Several factors helped to achieve universal health 
coverage and improve outcomes. These factors include economic growth, political 
stability, a comprehensive transformation strategy led by a transformation team, 
rapid policy translation, flexible implementation with continuous learning, and 
simultaneous improvements in the health system, on both the demand side 
(increased health insurance coverage, expanded benefits, and reduced 
cost-sharing) and the supply side (expansion of infrastructure, health human 
resources, and health services).

BACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is implicated in DNA repair and 
transcription regulation. Niraparib (MK4827) is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 
and PARP-2 inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in preclinical tumour 
models with loss of BRCA and PTEN function. We investigated the safety, 
tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
profiles, and preliminary antitumour activity of niraparib.
METHODS: In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, we enrolled patients with advanced 
solid tumours at one site in the UK and two sites in the USA. Eligible patients 
were aged at least 18 years; had a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks; had an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less; had 
assessable disease; were not suitable to receive any established treatments; had 
adequate organ function; and had discontinued any previous anticancer treatments 
at least 4 weeks previously. In part A, cohorts of three to six patients, 
enriched for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, received niraparib daily at ten 
escalating doses from 30 mg to 400 mg in a 21-day cycle to establish the maximum 
tolerated dose. Dose expansion at the maximum tolerated dose was pursued in 15 
patients to confirm tolerability. In part B, we further investigated the maximum 
tolerated dose in patients with sporadic platinum-resistant high-grade serous 
ovarian cancer and sporadic prostate cancer. We obtained blood, circulating 
tumour cells, and optional paired tumour biopsies for pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic assessments. Toxic effects were assessed by common toxicity 
criteria and tumour responses ascribed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST). Circulating tumour cells and archival tumour tissue in prostate 
patients were analysed for exploratory putative predictive biomarkers, such as 
loss of PTEN expression and ETS rearrangements. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00749502.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 15, 2008, and Jan 14, 2011, we enrolled 100 patients: 60 
in part A and 40 in part B. 300 mg/day was established as the maximum tolerated 
dose. Dose-limiting toxic effects reported in the first cycle were grade 3 
fatigue (one patient given 30 mg/day), grade 3 pneumonitis (one given 60 
mg/day), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (two given 400 mg/day). Common 
treatment-related toxic effects were anaemia (48 patients [48%]), nausea (42 
[42%]), fatigue (42 [42%]), thrombocytopenia (35 [35%]), anorexia (26 [26%]), 
neutropenia (24 [24%]), constipation (23 [23%]), and vomiting (20 [20%]), and 
were predominantly grade 1 or 2. Pharmacokinetics were dose proportional and the 
mean terminal elimination half-life was 36·4 h (range 32·8-46·0). 
Pharmacodynamic analyses confirmed PARP inhibition exceeded 50% at doses greater 
than 80 mg/day and antitumour activity was documented beyond doses of 60 mg/day. 
Eight (40% [95% CI 19-64]) of 20 BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers with ovarian 
cancer had RECIST partial responses, as did two (50% [7-93]) of four mutation 
carriers with breast cancer. Antitumour activity was also reported in sporadic 
high-grade serous ovarian cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and prostate 
cancer. We recorded no correlation between loss of PTEN expression or ETS 
rearrangements and measures of antitumour activity in patients with prostate 
cancer.
INTERPRETATION: A recommended phase 2 dose of 300 mg/day niraparib is well 
tolerated. Niraparib should be further assessed in inherited and sporadic 
cancers with homologous recombination DNA repair defects and to target 
PARP-mediated transcription in cancer.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adherence to antiviral treatment is important to achieve 
sustained virological response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We evaluated 
the efficiency of a multidisciplinary support programme (MSP), based on 
published HIV treatment experience, to increase patient adherence and the 
efficacy of pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in CHC.
METHODS: 447 patients receiving antiviral treatment were distributed into 3 
groups: control group (2003-2004, n=147), MSP group (2005-2006, n=131), and 
MSP-validation group (2007-2009, n=169). The MSP group included two 
hepatologists, two nurses, one pharmacist, one psychologist, one administrative 
assistant, and one psychiatrist. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using 
a Markov model.
RESULTS: Adherence and SVR rates were higher in the MSP (94.6% and 77.1%) and 
MSP-validation (91.7% and 74.6%) groups compared to controls (78.9% and 61.9%) 
(p<0.05 in all cases). SVR was higher in genotypes 1 or 4 followed by the MSP 
group vs. controls (67.7% vs. 48.9%, p=0.02) compared with genotypes 2 or 3 
(87.7% vs. 81.4%, p=n.s.). The MSP was the main predictive factor of SVR in 
patients with genotype 1. The rate of adherence in patients with psychiatric 
disorders was higher in the MSP groups (n=95, 90.5%) compared to controls (n=28, 
75.7%) (p=0.02). The cost per patient was € 13,319 in the MSP group and € 16,184 
in the control group. The MSP group achieved more quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) (16.317 QALYs) than controls (15.814 QALYs) and was dominant in all 
genotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: MSP improves patient compliance and increases the efficiency of 
antiviral treatment in CHC, being cost-effective.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: We used a new, semi-parametric method to estimate life 
expectancy and expected years of life lost (EYLL) after diagnosis of gastric 
cancer and assess whether patients' sex or tumor type or location had any 
effects.
METHODS: We performed a nationwide retrospective cohort study of 35,576 patients 
with gastric cancer who were registered in the Taiwan Cancer Registry from 1998 
through 2007; data were collected until the end of 2010. The Monte Carlo method 
and tables in Taiwan National Vital Statistics database were matched to the 
cohort reference populations on the basis of age and sex. The estimated 
regression line and the survival curve of reference populations were used to 
extrapolate the survival curve beyond 2010. We compared patients' age at 
diagnosis, life expectancy, and EYLL based on sex, tumor type, and location.
RESULTS: In Taiwan, gastric cancer is more prevalent among men, and 88.6% of 
tumors are adenocarcinomas. Patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia 
have shorter life expectancies and greater EYLL than those with noncardia tumors 
(P < .05). Women with gastric adenocarcinoma are diagnosed at a younger age and
