OBJECTIVE: Dulaglutide 1.5 mg once weekly is a novel glucagon-like peptide 1 
(GLP-1) receptor agonist, for the treatment of type two diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM). The objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dulaglutide once 
weekly vs liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily for the treatment of T2DM in Spain in 
patients with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2.
METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) was used to estimate costs and 
outcomes from the perspective of Spanish National Health System, capturing 
relevant direct medical costs over a lifetime time horizon. Comparative safety 
and efficacy data were derived from direct comparison of dulaglutide 1.5 mg vs 
liraglutide 1.8 mg from the AWARD-6 trial in patients with a body mass index 
(BMI) ≥30 kg/m2. All patients were assumed to remain on treatment for 2 years 
before switching treatment to basal insulin at a daily dose of 40 IU. One-way 
sensitivity analyses (OWSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were 
conducted to explore the sensitivity of the model to plausible variations in key 
parameters and uncertainty of model inputs.
RESULTS: Under base case assumptions, dulaglutide 1.5 mg was less costly and 
more effective vs liraglutide 1.8 mg (total lifetime costs €108,489 vs €109,653; 
total QALYS 10.281 vs 10.259). OWSA demonstrated that dulaglutide 1.5 mg 
remained dominant given plausible variations in key input parameters. Results of 
the PSA were consistent with base case results.
LIMITATIONS: Primary limitations of the analysis are common to other 
cost-effectiveness analyses of chronic diseases like T2DM and include the 
extrapolation of short-term clinical data to the lifetime time horizon and 
uncertainty around optimum treatment durations.
CONCLUSION: The model found that dulaglutide 1.5 mg was more effective and less 
costly than liraglutide 1.8 mg for the treatment of T2DM in Spain. Findings were 
robust to plausible variations in inputs. Based on these results, dulaglutide 
may result in cost savings to the Spanish National Health System.

OBJECTIVE: Two disease-modifying therapies are licensed in the EU for use in 
rapidly-evolving severe (RES) relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), 
fingolimod and natalizumab. Here a discrete event simulation (DES) model to 
analyze the cost-effectiveness of natalizumab and fingolimod in the RES 
population, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, 
is reported.
METHODS: A DES model was developed to track individual RES patients, based on 
Expanded Disability Status Scale scores. Individual patient characteristics were 
taken from the RES sub-groups of the pivotal trials for fingolimod. Utility data 
were in line with previous models. Published costs were inflated to NHS cost 
year 2015. Owing to the confidential patient access scheme (PAS) discount 
applied to fingolimod in the UK, a range of discount levels were applied to the 
fingolimod list price, to capture the likelihood of natalizumab being 
cost-effective in a real-world setting.
RESULTS: At the lower National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
threshold of £20,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), fingolimod only required 
a discount greater than 0.8% of list price to be cost-effective. At the upper 
threshold of £30,000/QALY employed by the NICE, fingolimod was cost-effective if 
the confidential discount is greater than 2.5%. Sensitivity analyses conducted 
using fingolimod list-price showed the model to be most sensitive to changes in 
the cost of each drug, particularly fingolimod.
CONCLUSIONS: The DES model shows that only a modest discount to the UK 
fingolimod list-price is required to make fingolimod a more cost-effective 
option than natalizumab in RES RRMS.

BACKGROUND: A Phase-3 study of defibrotide compared with historical controls 
demonstrated a 23% improvement in 100-day survival post-hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) among patients with veno-occlusive disease with 
multi-organ dysfunction (VOD with MOD).
AIM: To estimate the budget impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing 
defibrotide to a transplant center.
METHODS: The authors developed a budget impact model from the perspective of a 
bone-marrow transplant center. It was estimated that 2.3% of adults and 4.2% of 
children would develop VOD with MOD following HSCT based on a retrospective 
hospital database analysis and the effect that treating patients with 
defibrotide would have on costs for adult and pediatric centers was estimated. A 
cost-utility analysis (CUA) was also developed to capture the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of defibrotide. Projected life expectancies in the two groups 
were estimated based on trial data, transplant registry data, studies of 
long-term survival among HSCT patients, and US population life-tables.
RESULTS: There was an estimated 3% increase ($330,706) per year in total adult 
transplantation center costs associated with adopting defibrotide, and a <1% 
increase ($106,385) for pediatric transplant centers, assuming 100 transplants 
per year. In the CUA, the lifetime increase in cost per patient was $106,928, 
life expectancy increased by 3.74 years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
increased by 2.24. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $47,736 
per QALY gained; 88% probability defibrotide was cost-effective at a 
$100,000/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSION: The budget impact of defibrotide for a transplant center is 
relatively modest compared to the overall cost of transplantation. Defibrotide 
provides an important survival advantage for VOD with MOD patients, and the life 
years gained lead to defibrotide being highly cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: An advanced strategy for chilled fish preservation, based on the 
inclusion in ice of an extract of jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) skin (JSS), is 
proposed. Aqueous solutions including acetic acid-ethanol extracts of JSS were 
tested at two different concentrations as icing media, with the effects on the 
quality evolution of chilled hake (Merluccius merluccius) being monitored.
RESULTS: A significant inhibition (P < 0.05) of microbial activity (aerobes, 
psychrotrophs, Enterobacteriaceae, proteolytic bacteria; pH, trimethylamine) was 
obtained in hake corresponding to the icing batch including the highest JSS 
concentration. Additionally, fish specimens from such icing conditions showed an 
inhibitory effect (P < 0.05) on lipid hydrolysis development, while no effect (P 
> 0.05) was depicted for lipid oxidation. Sensory analysis (skin and mucus 
development; eyes; gills; texture; external odour; raw and cooked flesh odour; 
flesh taste) indicated a shelf life extension of chilled hake stored in ice 
including the highest JSS concentration.
CONCLUSION: A profitable use of JSS, an industrial by-product during jumbo squid 
commercialisation, has been developed in the present work, which leads to a 
remarkable microbial inhibition and a significant shelf life extension of 
chilled hake. In agreement with previous research, ommochrome pigments (i.e. 
lipophilic-type compounds) would be considered responsible for this preservative 
effect. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

Oxidative damage of telomeres can promote cancer, cardiac failure, and muscular 
dystrophy. Specific mechanisms protecting telomeres from oxidative damage have 
not been described. We analyzed telomeric chromatin composition during the cell 
cycle and show that the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) is enriched 
at telomeres during S phase. Deletion of the PRDX1 gene leads to damage of 
telomeric DNA upon oxidative stress, revealing a protective function of PRDX1 
against oxidative damage at telomeres. We also show that the oxidized nucleotide 
8-oxo-2'deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (8oxodGTP) causes premature chain 
termination when incorporated by telomerase and that some DNA substrates 
terminating in 8oxoG prevent extension by telomerase. Thus, PRDX1 safeguards 
telomeres from oxygen radicals to counteract telomere damage and preserve 
telomeric DNA for elongation by telomerase.

Atypical Intraductal Cribriform Proliferations of the Prostate Exhibit Similar 
Molecular and Clinicopathologic Characteristics as Intraductal Carcinoma of the 
Prostate.

Atypical intraductal cribriform proliferations of the prostate (AIP) are loose 
cribriform proliferations of luminal cells that exhibit greater architectural 
complexity and/or nuclear atypia than high-grade prostatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia (HGPIN), but lack the diagnostic criteria for intraductal carcinoma 
(IDC). The significance of AIP has not been formally established. We compared 
the clinical, morphologic, and immunohistochemical characteristics of AIP with 
classic IDC in 310 radical prostatectomy specimens that were received over an 
18-month period. Of the 310 cases, 46 cases had AIP only (n=10), IDC only (n=6), 
or AIP coexisting with IDC (n=30). The ERG status of all 46 AIP/IDC cases was 
identical to the nearby acinar carcinoma, contrasted to just 3 cases of HGPIN 
(7%, P<0.01). The degree of uniform phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss 
in 34 selected cases was identical in AIP and IDC (66.7%). No foci of HGPIN 
showed uniform PTEN loss; there was only 38% concordance of PTEN expression 
pattern between HGPIN and the nearby acinar carcinoma, unlike AIP and IDC (77% 
and 81%, respectively, P<0.01). AIP-associated and/or IDC-associated carcinoma 
(n=46) showed a higher stage and grade compared with acinar-only carcinoma 
(n=264, P<0.01). AIP-associated carcinoma had similar clinicopathologic features 
as IDC-associated carcinoma, including preoperative prostate-specific antigen, 
Gleason score, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph 
node metastasis (n=36, P>0.05). In conclusion, AIP shares similar ERG/PTEN 
immunoprofiles and exhibits similar clinical behavior as IDC, warranting 
immediate repeat biopsy when AIP is identified on biopsy, as is recommended in 
the most recent WHO Classification of Tumours of the Urinary System and Male 
Genital Organs, 2016.

Mitral valve diseases (MVD)s, comprising congenital and acquired forms, are 
characterized by a diverse etiology, pathophysiology, prevalence, and incidence. 
In industrialized countries, the acquired forms represent 2.5% of all 
cardiovascular diseases, with a marked augmentation after the age of 65 years. 
In addition, all forms of MVDs (i.e., degenerative forms) have a difficult 
clinical management. The major challenge is 'the early diagnosis', and 
echocardiographic analysis has been shown inappropriate for diagnosing MVD in 
moderate forms. Thus, there is a strong need to identify more appropriate 
biomarker tools to diagnose MVDs at early clinical stage before complications 
occur and worsen the prognosis. Innovative biomarker tools may particularly be 
appropriate for the complex treatment of elderly patients, the clinical 
management of which is very difficult due to the high risk of surgical 
interventions and no clear benefits in terms of life expectancy or quality of 
life compared to younger patients. These biomarker tools may be identified as 
genetic factors and/or components of cellular and molecular pathways related to 
the mechanisms of MDV pathophysiology. In this review, emphasis is placed on the 
possibility of proposing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) pathways, their genetic 
variants and microRNA as promising predictive, diagnostic and prognostic 
biomarkers and targets for personalized treatments. Evidence is also provided of 
the lack of any consistent evidence which actually hampers their clinical 
application. Thus, criticisms and concerns are underlined, as well as 
suggestions to close the existing gaps.

BACKGROUND: In palliative care, prediction of life expectancy is one of the most 
crucial issues for patients, family and medical staff, in order to provide 
appropriate end-of-life care. The aim of this study was to formulate a new 
objective score to predict life expectancy within 1 week for terminally ill 
patients with cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records were obtained from 187 terminally-ill 
patients with cancer who were admitted for palliative care. The biomarkers for a 
potential 'Objective Predictive Score' were assessed.
RESULTS: Profiling of blood parameters demonstrated that elevated levels of 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (T-bil), blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN), creatinine (Cr) and a decreased platelet count were significantly 
correlated with death within 1 week in a training cohort. Our formulated 
Objective Predictive Score was able to predict death within 1 week with high 
accuracy in a training and a validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: Our scoring system might enable the assessment of prognostication 
with higher accuracy in a terminal care setting.

Athetis dissimilis (Hampson) has emerged as a serious pest on corn in recent 
years in China. Understanding the population response of A. dissimilis to 
temperature will be beneficial for adopting control strategies for this pest. 
The impact of five constant temperatures (17, 21, 25, 29, and 33 °C) on the life 
table of A. dissimilis was studied using age-stage, two-sex life table method in 
the laboratory. The results showed that the developmental time of egg, larva, 
pupa, and adult decreased when temperature increased from 17 °C to 33 °C. The 
TPOP (total preoviposition period) decreased with temperature increasing from 
17 °C to 29 °C, while the longest APOP (adult preoviposition period) occurred at 
21 °C (3.57 d) and the shortest at 33 °C (2.15 d). The fecundity increased from 
407.52 to 763.94 eggs as temperatures were raised from 17 to 25 °C, but 
decreased at temperatures from 25 °C to 33 °C. The intrinsic rate of increase 
(r), finite rate of increase (λ), and net reproductive rate (R0) increased as 
temperatures increased from 17 to 25 °C, then decreased when temperatures 
exceeded 25 °C. In contrast, the mean generation time (T) decreased as 
temperatures increased from 17 to 33 °C. Based on the estimated data, the 
highest female age-stage-specific fecundity (fx) and age-specific fecundity (mx) 
were 81.91 and 45.04 eggs, respectively, at 25 °C. The age-stage life expectancy 
(exj) of all stages decreased as the temperature increased. The reproductive 
value (vxj) increased gradually with age and stage. The developmental rates of 
A. dissimilis between 17 to 29 °C fit the linear equation y 
 = -0.01315 + 0.001303x, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9314. In 
conclusion, our finding clearly states that A. dissimilis has the greatest 
population increase at 25 °C, and this may help develop appropriate pest 
management strategies.

Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) is one of the polyphagous pests destroying crops such 
as sugar beet worldwide. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the 
resistance of 24 sugar beet genotypes to S. exigua. In this study, nine sugar 
beet cultivars (Dorotea, Tous, Persia, Silenta, Jaam, HM1339RZ, Jolgeh, Ekbatan, 
and SBSI006), three hybrids ((7112*SB36)*Sh-1-HSF-5, (7112*SB36)*Sh-1-HSF-15, 
and (7112*SB36)*Sh-1-HSF-16), four lines (FC201, FC301, FC220, and FC221), and 
eight populations (SB26, SB27, SB28, SB29, SB30, SB33, SB34, and SB35) were 
assessed. The experiments were performed under laboratory conditions at 
25 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h using age-stage, 
two-sex life table procedure. The larval period ranged from 17.09 d on FC301 to 
14.47 d on SB30. The total fecundity (F) was highest on (7112*SB36)*Sh-1-HSF-5 
(905.13 eggs) and lowest on FC301 (312.46 eggs). (7112*SB36)*Sh-1-HSF-5 and 
FC220 with 318.02 and 26.76 eggs per individual had the highest and lowest net 
reproductive rates (R0), respectively. The highest values of the intrinsic rate 
of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (λ) were on (7112*SB36)*Sh-1-HSF-5 
(r: 0.187 d - 1, λ: 1.205 d - 1) and the lowest were on FC301 (r: 0.104 d - 1, 
λ: 1.11 d - 1). SB26 (r: 0.185 d - 1, λ: 1.203 d - 1) and FC220 (r: 0.114 d - 1, 
λ: 1.12 d - 1) had no significant difference with (7112*SB36)*Sh-1-HSF-5 and 
FC301, respectively. The comparison of demographic parameters of S. exigua on 24 
sugar beet genotypes suggested that FC220 and FC301 were the most resistant and 
(7112*SB36)*Sh-1-HSF-5 and SB26 were the most susceptible genotypes to this 
pest.

HIV is a global pandemic. However, anti-retroviral therapy has transformed the 
prognosis and, providing compliance is good, a normal life expectancy can be 
anticipated. This has led to increasing numbers of people with chronic 
prevalent, treated infection living to older ages. Musculoskeletal pain is 
commonly reported by HIV patients and, with resumption of near-normal immune 
function, HIV-infected patients develop inflammatory rheumatic diseases that 
require assessment and management in rheumatology clinics. Moreover, it is 
becoming apparent that avascular necrosis and osteoporosis are common 
comorbidities of HIV. This review will contextualize the prevalence of 
musculoskeletal symptoms in HIV, informed by data from a UK-based clinic, and 
will discuss the management of active inflammatory rheumatic diseases among 
HIV-infected patients taking anti-retroviral therapy, highlighting known drug 
interactions.

Protein bioconjugates can be synthesized by using chemical reactions, enzymatic 
reactions or genetic engineering technologies. Naturally occurred protein fusion 
event is used on purpose in the development of better biopharmaceuticals by 
applying genetic engineering methodologies. This review will mainly focus on the 
types of fusion proteins produced with the use of recombinant DNA technology, by 
combining genes or parts of genes from the same or different organisms, in order 
to be used in pharmaceutical applications for several purposes. Main concerns 
for the development of better biopharmaceuticals include quality, efficacy, 
safety, immunogenicity and toxicity issues. Extending half-life of the drug to 
increase patient compliance, targeting the drugs to reduce toxicity, improving 
the manufacturing environment to reduce the costs and revealing protein 
interaction technologies to find novel and superior drugs are the main aims of

BACKGROUND: Long-term survival and risk of reoperation in "non-Marfan syndrome" 
patients with a long life expectancy who undergo emergency surgery for acute 
type A aortic dissection (aTAAD) are not well known.
AIM: To analyse survival, risk of reoperation and quality of life in this 
population.
METHODS: From 1990 to 2010, all patients aged≤50 years and not affected by 
Marfan syndrome, who underwent emergency surgery for aTAAD at two institutions, 
were included in this analysis. Patients were categorized into four groups 
according to the extension of the aortic replacement: SUPRACORONARY, ROOT, ARCH 
and EXTENSIVE.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (mean age 45±4 years; range 34-50 years) were 
considered eligible for this analysis. Overall in-hospital mortality was 24% 
(16/66 patients); and 25%, 23%, 20.5% and 43% in the SUPRACORONARY, ROOT, ARCH 
and EXTENSIVE groups, respectively. Mean follow-up among survivors was 10.5±7.2 
years (range: 0.1-24.7 years). Overall 10-year survival was 55±6%; and 75±12%, 
69±13%, 47±8% and 28±17% in the SUPRACORONARY, ROOT, ARCH and EXTENSIVE groups, 
respectively. Overall freedom from reoperation on the aorta was 73±7.5%; and 
40±20%, 75±21%, 78±8% and 100% in the SUPRACORONARY, ROOT, ARCH and EXTENSIVE 
groups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, patients who underwent isolated supracoronary 
ascending aorta or root replacement showed the most satisfactory late survival. 
However, because the risk of reoperation is low when the replacement is extended 
to the root, our data suggest that root replacement could represent a good 
compromise between operative mortality and long-term survival.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of left ventricular 
assist devices (LVADs) as destination therapy in ambulatory patients with 
advanced heart failure.
BACKGROUND: LVADs improve survival and quality of life in inotrope-dependent 
heart failure, but data are limited as to their value in less severely ill 
patients.
METHODS: We determined costs of care among Medicare beneficiaries before and 
after LVAD implantation from 2009 to 2010. We used these costs and efficacy data 
from published studies in a Markov model to project the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of destination LVAD therapy compared with that 
of medical management. We discounted costs and benefits at 3% annually and 
report costs as 2016 U.S. dollars.
RESULTS: The mean cost of LVAD implantation was $175,420. The mean cost of 
readmission was lower before LVAD than after ($12,377 vs. $19,465, respectively; 
p < 0.001), while monthly outpatient costs were similar ($3,364 vs. $2,974, 
respectively; p = 0.54). In the lifetime simulation model, LVAD increased 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (4.41 vs. 2.67, respectively), readmissions 
(13.03 vs. 6.35, respectively), and costs ($726,200 vs. $361,800, respectively) 
compared with medical management, yielding an ICER of $209,400 per QALY gained 
and $597,400 per life-year gained. These results were sensitive to LVAD 
readmission rates and outpatient care costs; the ICER would be $86,900 if 
these parameters were 50% lower.
CONCLUSIONS: LVADs in non-inotrope-dependent heart failure patients improved 
quality of life but substantially increased lifetime costs because of frequent 
readmissions and costly follow-up care. LVADs may provide good value if 
outpatient costs and adverse events can be reduced.

Elder populations have been increasing in Japan and estimated 24 million people 
have knee osteoarthritis(OA). Recently, people have diverse sociological 
background and demand for participating sports has been growing. People may 
participate sports to prevent some diseases such as locomotive syndrome. 
According to the recent studies, excessive high impact sports increase the risk 
of OA, while daily life exercise decrease the risk. Epidemiological approach 
demonstrated that reduced knee extension muscle strength increases the risk of 
OA. We reviewed and discussed the recent topics including efficacy of physical 
therapy for knee OA and how much sports activities could be beneficial after 
knee surgery.

Giant cell tumour (GCT) of flat bones of pelvis is extremely rare. GCT of the 
ilium and ischium represent less than 0.05% of all GCT. Iliac bone GCT has been 
treated traditionally by intra-lesion curettage with bone grafting, wide 
resection with or without reconstruction and hemi-pelvectomy in very aggressive 
tumours. None of the above treatments were without morbidities. Reconstruction 
using bone grafts and bone cement has also been inadequate. In GCT, where life 
expectancy is not decreased significantly, surgical treatment should be aimed at 
giving optimum functional outcome. We are reporting here a rare case of giant 
cell tumour of ilium bone in a 25-year-old female and its unique treatment 
approach. We designed a computed tomography (CT) based customized iliac 
prosthesis using Materialise Mimics and 3-Matic software. 3D model of pelvis was 
generated from the CT. After deciding the extent of resection on affected side, 
we virtually mirrored an identical portion of opposite ilium to the affected 
side. Connecting plates were made over the mirrored part and merged with it. 
Multiple relevant holes were made to attach various muscles to the prosthesis. 
Prosthesis was made in medical grade titanium by using Computerized Numerical 
Control (CNC) machine. The method is called as computer based subtractive 
manufacturing. Wide resection was done and the prosthesis was placed using 
multiple 3.5 millimetres screws through the connecting plates. Muscles were 
stitched to relevant holes using ethibond suture. Post-operative course was 
unremarkable. Patient was made to walk with full weight bearing after 5 weeks. 
Powers of abductors at 6 months is 4/5 and patient walks normally without a 
limp.

BACKGROUND: As the life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) 
increases, the focus on ensuring success with medication therapies is 
increasingly important. The ability of patients to autonomously manage 
medications and related therapies is poorly described in the literature. 
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this project was to assess the level of 
medication-related knowledge and self-care skills in patients with CF. METHODS: 
This project took place in a Cystic Fibrosis Foundation accredited affiliate 
center. Eighty-nine patients between the ages of 6 and 60 were eligible to 
participate based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pharmacists administered 
a 16-item questionnaire and detailed medication history during clinic visits 
from January through May 2014. RESULTS: Forty-five patients 6 to 41 years old 
participated in the study. The skills most often performed independently were 
preparing nebulizer treatments (85%) and telling someone if they feel their 
medicines are causing a problem (89%). Skills least often performed were 
carrying a medication list (82%) and bringing a medication list to appointments 
(76%). In respondents 21 years of age and older, less than 75% of respondents 
were involved with obtaining financial resources, maintaining equipment, 
carrying a medication list, or rinsing their mouth after using inhaled 
medicines. Participants were able to provide drug name, dose, and frequency of 
use for pancreatic enzymes and azithromycin 37% and 24% of the time, 
respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the population surveyed, many medication-related 
skills had not been acquired by early adulthood. Assessing and providing 
education for medication-related self-care skills at all ages are needed.

Peroxidases (PRXs) are widely existed in various organisms and could be divided 
into different types according to their structures and functions. Specifically, 
the Class III Peroxidase, a plant-specific multi-gene family, involves in many 
physiological processes, such as the metabolism of auxin, the extension and 
thickening of cell wall, as well as the formation of lignin. By searching the 
pear genome database, 94 non-redundant PRXs from Pyrus bretschneideri (PbPRXs) 
were identified. Subsequently, analysis of phylogenetic relationships, gene 
structures, conserved motifs, and microsynteny was performed. These PbPRXs were 
unevenly distributed among 17 chromosomes of pear. In addition, 26 segmental 
duplication events but only one tandem duplication were occurred in these 
PbPRXs, implying segmental duplication was the main contributor to the expansion 
of the PbPRX family. By the Ka/Ks analysis, 26 out of 27 duplicated PbPRXs has 
experienced purifying selection. Twenty motifs were identified in PbPRXs based 
on the MEME analysis, 11 of which were enriched in pear. A total of 41 expressed 
genes were identified from ESTs of pear fruit. According to qRT-PCR, the 
expression trends of five PbPRXs in subgroup C were consistent with the change 
of lignin content during pear fruit development. So we inferred that the five 
PbPRXs were candidate genes involved in the lignin synthesis pathway. These 
results provided useful information for further researches of PRX genes in pear.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study is to establish the relationship 
between foot-ankle patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) and three measures 
of foot-ankle alignment (MoFAA) in patients with metatarsal head pain.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study where 206 patients completed three PROMs and a 
clinician recorded three MoFAA bilaterally (three times each). A reliability 
analysis of the MoFAA, a correlation analysis (between MoFAA and PROM) and 
regression analysis (dependent variable: PROM; independent variables: MoFAA) 
were performed.
RESULTS: Pearson's coefficient changed in each PROM used, ranging from 0.243 
(AAOS-FAMShoeComfortScale-FVARight) to 0.807 (FFIIndex-first MTPJEright). 
Regression indices (R2-corrected) ranged between 0.117 
(AAOS-FAMShoeComfortScale) and 0.701 (FFIIndex).
CONCLUSIONS: The MoFAA correlated between moderately to strongly with the 
foot-ankle PROM selected. The level of correlation between MoFAA and PROM was 
higher when patients with metatarsal head pain were asked about foot health 
status, pain and function; however, the correlation was poor when the patient 
was asked about shoe aspects. In addition, the MoFAA variable that achieved the 
highest correlation value was the first metatarsophalangeal joint extension. The 
results obtained in this study could be used in future studies to develop tools 
for assessing and monitoring patients with metatarsal head pain.

Increasing inequality in age of death at shared levels of life expectancy: A 
comparative study of Scotland and England and Wales.

Kingdom.

There is a strong negative correlation between increasing life expectancy and 
decreasing lifespan variation, a measure of inequality. Previous research 
suggests that countries achieving a high level of life expectancy later in time 
generally do so with lower lifespan variation than forerunner countries. This 
may be because they are able to capitalise on lessons already learnt. However, a 
few countries achieve a high level of life expectancy later in time with higher 
inequality. Scotland appears to be such a country and presents an interesting 
case study because it previously experienced lower inequality when reaching the 
same level of life expectancy as its closest comparator England and Wales. We 
calculated life expectancy and lifespan variation for Scotland and England and 
Wales for the years 1950 to 2012, comparing Scotland to England and Wales when 
it reached the same level of life expectancy later on in time, and assessed the 
difference in the level of lifespan variation. The lifespan variation difference 
between the two countries was then decomposed into age-specific components. 
Analysis was carried out for males and females separately. Since the 1950s 
Scotland has achieved the same level of life expectancy at least ten years later 
in time than England and Wales. Initially it did so with lower lifespan 
variation. Following the 1980s Scotland has been achieving the same level of 
life expectancy later in time than England and Wales and with higher inequality, 
particularly for males. Decomposition revealed that higher inequality is partly 
explained by lower older age mortality rates but primarily by higher premature 
adult age mortality rates when life expectancy is the same. Existing studies 
suggest that premature adult mortality rates are strongly associated with the 
social determinants of health and may be amenable to social and economic 
policies. So addressing these policy areas may have benefits for both inequality 
and population health in Scotland.

AIMS: This multicentre, randomized, double-blind study investigated the efficacy 
and safety of gemigliptin in Korean type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients 
with moderate to severe renal impairment (RI).
METHODS: The study comprised a 12-week main part and a 40-week extension. We 
report here the results from the main part. In total, 132 patients were 
randomized to receive gemigliptin (n = 66) or placebo (n = 66). Changes in 
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; primary endpoint), other glycaemic control 
parameters (fasting plasma glucose, glycated albumin and fructosamine), lipid 
profiles, renal function parameters and safety profiles were evaluated.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups (mean 
HbA1c, 8.4% [68 mmol/mol]; age, 62.0 years; duration of type 2 diabetes, 
16.3 years; estimated glomerular filtration rate, 33.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 ). At Week 
12, the adjusted mean change ± standard error in HbA1c with gemigliptin was 
-0.82% ± 0.14% (-8.9 ± 1.5 mmol/mol), whereas it was 0.38% ± 0.14% 
(4.2 ± 1.5 mmol/mol) with placebo (significant between-group difference, P 
 < .001). Other glycaemic control parameters showed beneficial changes as well. 
Body weight change (gemigliptin, -0.3 kg; placebo, -0.2 kg) was not significant. 
In the gemigliptin group, the mean decrease in urinary albumin creatinine ratio 
(UACR) was significant, both in patients with microalbuminuria (-41.9 mg/g 
creatinine, P  = .03) and macroalbuminuria (-528.9 mg/g creatinine, P  < .001). 
Drug-related adverse events were similar with gemigliptin and placebo (15% and 
12%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week treatment with gemigliptin improved glycaemic control and 
provided UACR reduction in T2DM patients with moderate to severe RI. Gemigliptin 
was well tolerated, with no additional risk of hypoglycaemia and change in body 
weight.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of an intervention to increase 
pneumococcal, influenza, and pertussis-containing vaccine uptake in adults aged 
65 and older in primary care practices.
DESIGN: Markov decision analysis model, comparing the cost-effectiveness of the 
4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program with no intervention.
SETTING: Diverse primary care practices in two U.S. cities.
PARTICIPANTS: Clinical trial participants aged 65 and older.
MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), public health outcomes, and 
costs. Vaccination rates and intervention costs were derived from a randomized 
controlled cluster trial. Other parameters were derived from the medical 
literature and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. All parameters 
were individually and simultaneously varied over their distributions.
RESULTS: With the intervention program and extrapolating over 10 years, there 
would be approximately 60,920 fewer influenza cases, 2,031 fewer pertussis 
cases, and 13,842 fewer pneumococcal illnesses in adults aged 65 and older. 
Total per-person vaccination and illness costs with the intervention were $23.93 
higher than without the intervention, with a concurrent increase in 
effectiveness of 0.0031 QALYs, or $7,635 per QALY gained. In sensitivity 
analyses, no individual parameter variation caused the intervention to cost more 
than $50,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing an intervention based on the 4 Pillars Practice 
Transformation Program is a cost-effective undertaking in primary care practices 
for individuals aged 65 and older, with predicted public health benefits.

Little is known about sexual activity in old age, particularly in Africa. The 
objective of this paper is to estimate years of sexually active life for older 
men and women, and examine the association between sexual activity and 
self-rated health status. Data were extracted from two large cross sectional HIV 
household surveys conducted in 2005 and 2012 in South Africa. The Sullivan 
method was used to estimate sexually active life expectancy, whilst logistic 
regression was used to assess associations with sexual activity. Sexually active 
life expectancy was higher among men across all the age groups in both surveys. 
At age 50, the sexually active life expectancy for men was double that for women 
- 2005 (12.6 vs. 5.9 years), 2012 (12.7 vs. 7.2 years). Self-rated health was 
significantly associated with sexual activity in men (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 
1.56; 95% CI 1.11-2.19; p<0.001). Among older women, moderate exercise was 
associated with being sexual active, while HIV infection was significantly 
associated with reduced sexual activity. The presence of chronic conditions was 
also significantly associated with reduced sexual activity among men. The
