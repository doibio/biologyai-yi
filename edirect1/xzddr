Bovine babesiosis is a reportable transboundary animal disease caused by Babesia 
bovis and Babesiabigemina in the Americas where these apicomplexan protozoa are 
transmitted by the invasive cattle fever ticks Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) 
microplus and Rhipicephalus(Boophilus) annulatus. In countries like Mexico where 
cattle fever ticks remain endemic, bovine babesiosis is detrimental to cattle 
health and results in a significant economic cost to the livestock industry. 
These cattle disease vectors continue to threaten the U.S. cattle industry 
despite their elimination through efforts of the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication 
Program. Mexico and the U.S. share a common interest in managing cattle fever 
ticks through their economically important binational cattle trade. Here, we 
report the outcomes of a meeting where stakeholders from Mexico and the U.S. 
representing the livestock and pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies, and 
research institutions gathered to discuss research and knowledge gaps requiring 
attention to advance progressive management strategies for bovine babesiosis and 
cattle fever ticks. Research recommendations and other actionable activities 
reflect commitment among meeting participants to seize opportunities for 
collaborative efforts. Addressing these research gaps is expected to yield 
scientific knowledge benefitting the interdependent livestock industries of 
Mexico and the U.S. through its translation into enhanced biosecurity against 
the economic and animal health impacts of bovine babesiosis and cattle fever 
ticks.

The Role of the Cyanobacterial Type IV Pilus Machinery in Finding and 
Maintaining a Favourable Environment.

Type IV pili (T4P) are proteinaceous filaments found on the cell surface of many 
prokaryotic organisms and convey twitching motility through their 
extension/retraction cycles, moving cells across surfaces. In cyanobacteria, 
twitching motility is the sole mode of motility properly characterised to date 
and is the means by which cells perform phototaxis, the movement towards and 
away from directional light sources. The wavelength and intensity of the light 
source determine the direction of movement and, sometimes in concert with 
nutrient conditions, act as signals for some cyanobacteria to form mucoid 
multicellular assemblages. Formation of such aggregates or flocs represents an 
acclimation strategy to unfavourable environmental conditions and stresses, such 
as harmful light conditions or predation. T4P are also involved in natural 
transformation by exogenous DNA, secretion processes, and in cellular adaptation 
and survival strategies, further cementing the role of cell surface appendages. 
In this way, cyanobacteria are finely tuned by external stimuli to either escape 
unfavourable environmental conditions via phototaxis, exchange genetic material, 
and to modify their surroundings to fit their needs by forming multicellular 
assemblies.

As life expectancy is mostly increasing, the incidence of many neurological 
disorders is also constantly growing. For improving the physical functions 
affected by a neurological disorder, rehabilitation procedures are mandatory, 
and they must be performed regularly. Unfortunately, neurorehabilitation 
procedures have disadvantages in terms of costs, accessibility and a lack of 
therapists. This paper presents Immersive Neurorehabilitation Exercises Using 
Virtual Reality (INREX-VR), our innovative immersive neurorehabilitation system 
using virtual reality. The system is based on a thorough research methodology 
and is able to capture real-time user movements and evaluate joint mobility for 
both upper and lower limbs, record training sessions and save electromyography 
data. The use of the first-person perspective increases immersion, and the joint 
range of motion is calculated with the help of both the HTC Vive system and 
inverse kinematics principles applied on skeleton rigs. Tutorial exercises are 
demonstrated by a virtual therapist, as they were recorded with real-life 
physicians, and sessions can be monitored and configured through tele-medicine. 
Complex movements are practiced in gamified settings, encouraging 
self-improvement and competition. Finally, we proposed a training plan and 
preliminary tests which show promising results in terms of accuracy and user 
feedback. As future developments, we plan to improve the system's accuracy and 
investigate a wireless alternative based on neural networks.

INTRODUCTION: With the Safety Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research in 
Vehicle Evolution (SELF DRIVE) Act in the United States, there is a growing 
interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs). One avenue of innovation would be to use 
them to mobilize and coordinate response efforts during natural disasters. This 
study uses an earthquake response in an urban, developed setting as a 
hypothetical example case study. In this hypothetical scenario, private AVs 
would be mobilized to help rescue victims from collapsed structures.
METHODS: A Markov model compared an intervention arm with AVs to a status quo 
arm using a hypothetical cohort of American earthquake victims. The three 
possible health states were trapped but alive, rescued and alive, and dead. The 
cycle length of the Markov model was 6 h.
RESULTS: The cost of deploying AVs was $90,139 relative to $87,869 in status quo 
arm. Using AVs produced an incremental cost of $2269 (95% credible interval (CI) 
= $-12,985-$8959). Victims have 7.33 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the 
intervention arm compared to 7.20 QALYs in the status quo arm, resulting in an 
incremental gain of 0.13 (95% CI = -0.73-2.19) QALYs. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $16,960/QALY gained (95% CI = 
cost-saving-$69,065/QALY).
DISCUSSION: The mobilization of private AVs in the setting of an earthquake has 
the potential to save money and reduce the loss of life. AVs may advance 
emergency management competencies.

Increasing life expectancy in modern society is undoubtedly due to improved 
healthcare, scientific advances in medicine, and the overall healthy lifestyle 
of the general population. However, this positive trend has led to an increase 
in the number of older people with a growing need for a sustainable system for 
the long-term care of this part of the population, which includes social and 
health services that are essential for a high quality of life. Longevity also 
brings challenges in the form of a polymorbid geriatric population that places 
financial pressure on healthcare systems. Regardless, one disease dominates the 
debate about financial sustainability due to the increasing numbers of people 
diagnosed, and that is Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presented paper aims to 
demonstrate the economic burden of social and healthcare services. Data from two 
regions in the Czech Republic were selected to demonstrate the potential scope 
of the problem. The future costs connected with AD are calculated by a 
prediction model, which is based on a population model for predicting the number 
of people with AD between 2020 and 2070. Based on the presented data from the 
two regions in the Czech Republic and the prediction model, several trends 
emerged. There appears to be a significant difference in the annual direct costs 
per person diagnosed with AD depending on the region in which they reside. This 
may lead to a significant inequality of the services a person can acquire 
followed by subsequent social issues that can manifest as a lower quality of 
life. Furthermore, given the prediction of the growing AD population, the costs 
expressed in constant prices based on the year 2020 will increase almost 
threefold during the period 2020-2070. The predicted threefold increase will 
place additional financial pressure on all stakeholders responsible for social 
and healthcare services, as the current situation is already challenging.

Several studies have found maternal exposure to particulate matter pollution was 
associated with adverse birth outcomes, including infant mortality and preterm 
birth. In this context, our study aims to quantify the air pollution burden of 
disease due to preterm birth complications and infant death in Paris, with 
particular attention to people living in the most deprived census blocks. Data 
on infant death and preterm birth was available from the birth and death 
certificates. The postal address of mother's newborn was converted in census 
block number. A socioeconomic deprivation index was built at the census block 
level. Average annual ambient concentrations of PM10 were modelled at census 
block level using the ESMERALDA atmospheric modelling system. The number of 
infant deaths attributed to PM10 exposure is expressed in years of life lost. We 
used a three-step compartmental model to appraise neurodevelopmental impairment 
among survivors of preterm birth. We estimated that 12.8 infant deaths per 
100,000 live births may be attributable to PM10 exposure, and about one third of 
these infants lived in deprived census blocks. In addition, we found that 
approximately 4.8% of preterm births could be attributable to PM10 exposure, and 
approximately 1.9% of these infants died (corresponding to about 5.75 deaths per 
100,000 live birth). Quantification of environmental hazard-related health 
impacts for children at local level is essential to prioritizing interventions. 
Our study suggests that additional effort is needed to reduce the risk of 
complications and deaths related to air pollution exposure, especially among 
preterm births. Because of widespread exposure to air pollution, significant 
health benefits could be achieved through regulatory interventions aimed at 
reducing exposure of the population as a whole, and particularly of the most 
vulnerable, such as children and pregnant women.

Astaxanthin (AST), a xanthophyll belonging to the family of carotenoids, is a 
potent antioxidant. The effect of AST on longevity and its physiological and 
molecular mechanism are still unclear. In this study, we proved that AST could 
prolong the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans. To uncover whether AST could 
delay aging by upregulating autophagy, we measured the expression of autophagy 
gene and the life span of autophagy gene bec-1 mutant nematodes, and the results 
showed that the expression of autophagy gene was upregulated after AST 
intervention and the disruption of bec-1 weakened the extension of the life 
span. To explore the molecular mechanism of AST-induced autophagy upregulation, 
we knocked out the daf-16 or hlh-30 (key genes of insulin/insulin growth 
factor-1 [IGF-1] signal pathway or target of rapamycin [TOR] signal pathway) by 
RNA interference, and the expression of autophagy gene lgg-1 decreased. 
Collectively, our results strongly suggest that autophagy, which is both the 
insulin/IGF-1 signal pathway dependent and TOR signal pathway dependent, plays a 
role in the prolongation of the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans by AST.

Births and deaths in Sidama in southern Ethiopia: findings from the 2018 
Dale-Wonsho Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS).

BACKGROUND: Sidama is one of the most densely populated areas in Ethiopia. 
Information about the demographic characteristics is scarce, and most studies 
were census based on interviews. Earlier population studies from Ethiopia did 
not sufficiently address the validity of measuring births, deaths, and 
age-composition.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the population characteristics in Sidama with an 
emphasis on fertility estimates, age, and death reporting.
METHODS: This is a mixed-method cross-sectional study, conducted in Sidama in 
southern Ethiopia, using baseline data of newly established Dale-Wonsho Health 
and Demographic Surveillance System site in 2018. We used quantitative data of 
5179 randomly selected households having 25,144 individuals. We collected 
information on deaths in the same study period and population from the 
traditional burial associations (Iddir). Qualitative data were collected using 
focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews. Life tables, age reliability 
indices and logistic regression were used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: The total fertility rate was 2.9 children/woman, the crude birth rate 
was 22.8/1000 population and the crude death rate was 5.2/1000 population. The 
dependency ratio was 66/100 working-age population. Urban residents had higher 
birth rates (OR = 1.4 (95% CL: 1.05-1.78), and women with basic education had 
lower birth rates (OR = 0.6 (95% CL: 0.46-0.78) compared to those with no 
education. The age accuracy indices showed unreliable age reporting. The number 
of deaths increased from 29 to 132 when death reports from the Iddirs were 
included. There was under-reporting of neonatal and deaths of young children. 
Substituting national and regional mortality estimates, the life expectancy 
declined to an average of 53 years (range 48-58 years).
CONCLUSION: The fertility rate in Sidama is lower than previously reported and 
is affected by age, residence and education. As we have identified important 
measurement and reporting errors, future demographic surveillance sites should 
consider these limitations.

evaluation of the implementation of smokefree policies into two mental health 
trusts.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is 10-20 years lower among people with a severe 
mental health disorder. Most of these early deaths are due to chronic 
conditions, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Smoking is a 
major risk factor for these conditions and introducing smokefree policies has 
been recommended to mental health service providers in England by the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), in their Public Health 
Guideline 48: Smoking: acute, maternity and mental health services. This paper 
reports a process evaluation of introducing these policy recommendations, which 
were updated in 2013.
METHOD: Process data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 
staff (n = 51), members of partnering organisations (n = 5), service users 
(n = 7) and carers (n = 2) between November 2016 - April 2017. Normalization 
Process Theory (NPT) was used to design the data collection tools and analyse 
the data. A framework approach was taken with the analysis, using the four 
concepts of NPT: coherence, cognitive participation, collective action and 
reflexive monitoring.
RESULTS: The policy made sense to some staff, patients and carers (coherence) 
who 'bought-into' the idea (cognitive participation) but other participants 
disagreed. Although smokefree policies were operationalised (collective action), 
sometimes they were opposed. Progress was made, especially in some units, but 
continued to be resisted in others. Informal appraisal of progress (reflexive 
monitoring) presented a varied picture.
CONCLUSION: Some progress has been made in terms of changing an entrenched, 
smoking culture into one that is smokefree on Trust sites across the region. 
Perseverance and resourcing over the long-term is required to establish a 
non-smoking culture in on-site provision of mental health services.

Normal human body temperature (BT) has long been considered to be 37.0°C. Yet, 
BTs have declined over the past two centuries in the United States, coinciding 
with reductions in infection and increasing life expectancy. The generality of 
and reasons behind this phenomenon have not yet been well studied. Here, we show 
that Bolivian forager-farmers (n = 17,958 observations of 5481 adults age 15+ 
years) inhabiting a pathogen-rich environment exhibited higher BT when first 
examined in the early 21st century (~37.0°C). BT subsequently declined by 
~0.05°C/year over 16 years of socioeconomic and epidemiological change to 
~36.5°C by 2018. As predicted, infections and other lifestyle factors explain 
variation in BT, but these factors do not account for the temporal declines. 
Changes in physical activity, body composition, antibiotic usage, and thermal 
environment are potential causes of the temporal decline.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal disease with an average life 
expectancy of 3 to 5 years. IPF is characterized by progressive stiffening of 
the lung parenchyma due to excessive deposition of collagen, leading to gradual 
failure of gas exchange. Although two therapeutic agents have been approved from 
the FDA for IPF, they only slow disease progression with little impact on 
outcome. To develop a more effective therapy, we have exploited the fact that 
collagen-producing myofibroblasts express a membrane-spanning protein, 
fibroblast activation protein (FAP), that exhibits limited if any expression on 
other cell types. Because collagen-producing myofibroblasts are only found in 
fibrotic tissues, solid tumors, and healing wounds, FAP constitutes an excellent 
marker for targeted delivery of drugs to tissues undergoing pathologic fibrosis. 
We demonstrate here that a low-molecular weight FAP ligand can be used to 
deliver imaging and therapeutic agents selectively to FAP-expressing cells. 
Because induction of collagen synthesis is associated with phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase (PI3K) activation, we designed a FAP-targeted PI3K inhibitor that 
selectively targets FAP-expressing human IPF lung fibroblasts and potently 
inhibited collagen synthesis. Moreover, we showed that administration of the 
inhibitor in a mouse model of IPF inhibited PI3K activation in fibrotic lungs, 
suppressed production of hydroxyproline (major building block of collagen), 
reduced collagen deposition, and increased mouse survival. Collectively, these 
studies suggest that a FAP-targeted PI3K inhibitor might be promising for 
treating IPF.

The retinal basal glia (RBG) is a group of glia that migrates from the optic 
stalk into the third instar larval eye disc while the photoreceptor cells (PR) 
are differentiating. The RBGs are grouped into three major classes based on 
molecular and morphological characteristics: surface glia (SG), wrapping glia 
(WG) and carpet glia (CG). The SGs migrate and divide. The WGs are postmitotic 
and wraps PR axons. The CGs have giant nucleus and extensive membrane extension 
that each covers half of the eye disc. In this study, we used lineage tracing 
methods to determine the lineage relationships among these glia subtypes and the 
temporal profile of the lineage decisions for RBG development. We found that the 
CG lineage segregated from the other RBG very early in the embryonic stage. It 
has been proposed that the SGs migrate under the CG membrane, which prevented 
SGs from contacting with the PR axons lying above the CG membrane. Upon passing 
the front of the CG membrane, which is slightly behind the morphogenetic furrow 
that marks the front of PR differentiation, the migrating SG contact the nascent 
PR axon, which in turn release FGF to induce SGs' differentiation into WG. 
Interestingly, we found that SGs are equally distributed apical and basal to the 
CG membrane, so that the apical SGs are not prevented from contacting PR axons 
by CG membrane. Clonal analysis reveals that the apical and basal RBG are 
derived from distinct lineages determined before they enter the eye disc. 
Moreover, the basal SG lack the competence to respond to FGFR signaling, 
preventing its differentiation into WG. Our findings suggest that this novel 
glia-to-glia differentiation is both dependent on early lineage decision and on 
a yet unidentified regulatory mechanism, which can provide spatiotemporal 
coordination of WG differentiation with the progressive differentiation of 
photoreceptor neurons.

Osteoporotic vertebral fractures without prior adequate traumatization are 
frequent diagnosed in orthopedics because of the increasing life expectancy and 
incidence of osteoporosis. The associated high mortality is caused by reduced 
mobilization which leads to a higher risk of infection and a bedridden state. On 
the other hand the diagnosis of sacral insufficiency fractures is often 
prolonged because of unspecific symptoms while being associated with similar 
risks. This article presents an overview of the present scientific literature 
and a retrospective analysis of patients treated via balloon-assisted 
sacroplasty. In 8 years, ten patients (three men and seven women) were treated. 
The average age was 78.4 years and the average time until the diagnosis 
4.6 weeks. In most patients a significant pain reduction after the failure of 
conservative treatment thanks to operative treatment as well as increased 
mobility was observed. Only one experienced a minor surgical complication being 
cement leakage with nerval impaction which did not compromise her clinical 
outcome or satisfaction with the procedure. Balloon-assisted sacroplasty can 
possibly be seen as an effective symptomatic therapy in osteoporotic 
insufficiency fractures.

Health in College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.

PURPOSE: Regarding the universal health coverage (UHC) goal of eliminating 
health disparity, this study seeks to examine whether this objective has 
actually been achieved and whether residence affects health and well-being 
inequality.
METHODS: Based on Taiwan's experience with its UHC system, this research 
quantifies health and well-being indicators, including quality-adjusted life 
expectancy (QALE), consumption, and utility-adjusted life expectancy (UALE), and 
uses the geographic information system (GIS) to map regional well-being 
throughout Taiwan. Using spatial lag regressions, this study estimates how 
residence and socio-economic factors affect population's well-being.
RESULTS: Estimation results indicate a 1‰ increase in the mortality rate reduces 
the population's UALE by 0.4131 utility-adjusted life-years (UALYs). The 
differences in health and well-being indicators between urban and rural 
residents were 6.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 3.84 UALYs. 
Residents living in Taipei City had the highest level of QALE, consumption, and 
well-being, and those in Taitung County had the lowest level of QALE and 
well-being. The regional spatial autocorrelation results show that a 
population's health status and well-being are connected to residence.
CONCLUSION: Our estimation results show that risk of higher mortality rates in 
disadvantaged areas appears to be associated with well-being inequality, even 
with universal healthcare coverage. We suspect that related health intervention 
efforts, such as preventive and curative medical devotion, in Taiwan might not 
have effectively reached more rural residents, and thus recommend more work be 
undertaken to reduce mortality rates in these communities.

PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of healthcare 
spending among the leading Asian economies.
METHODS: We have selected a total of nine Asian nations, based on the strength 
of their economic output and long-term real GDP growth rates. The OECD members 
included Japan and the Republic of Korea, while the seven non-OECD nations were 
China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand. 
Healthcare systems efficiency was analyzed over the period 1996-2017. To assess 
the effectiveness of healthcare expenditure of each group of countries, the 
two-way fixed effects model (country- and year effects) was used.
RESULTS: Quality of governance and current health expenditure determine 
healthcare system performance. Population density and urbanization are 
positively associated with a healthy life expectancy in the non-OECD Asian 
countries. In this group, unsafe water drinking has a statistically negative 
effect on healthy life expectancy. Interestingly, only per capita consumption of 
carbohydrates is significantly linked with healthy life expectancy. In these 
non-OECD Asian countries, unsafe water drinking and per capita carbon dioxide 
emissions increase infant mortality. There is a strong negative association 
between GDP per capita and infant mortality in both sub-samples, although its 
impact is far larger in the OECD group. In Japan and South Korea, unemployment 
is negatively associated with infant mortality.
CONCLUSION: Japan outperforms other countries from the sample in major 
healthcare performance indicators, while South Korea is ranked second. The only 
exception is per capita carbon dioxide emissions, which have maximal values in 
the Republic of Korea and Japan. Non-OECD nations' outcomes were led by China, 
as the largest economy. This group was characterized with substantial 
improvement in efficiency of health spending since the middle of the 1990s. Yet, 
progress was noted with remarkable heterogeneity within the group.

BACKGROUND: Postpartum runners report musculoskeletal pain with running. Because 
of inadequate research, little is known about the origin and pain-related 
classification. Through expert consensus, this study is the first attempt to 
understand the musculoskeletal impairments that these runners present with. The 
objective of this survey was to gather expert consensus on characteristics of 
reported impairments in postpartum runners that have musculoskeletal pain.
METHODS: A web-based Delphi survey was conducted and was composed of five 
categories: strength, range of motion, alignment and flexibility impairments, as 
well as risk factors for pain in postpartum runners.
RESULTS: A total of 117 experts were invited. Forty-five experts completed round 
I and forty-one completed rounds II and III. The strength impairments that 
reached consensus were abdominal, hip and pelvic floor muscle weakness. The 
range of motion impairments that reached consensus were hip extension 
restriction, anterior pelvic tilt and general hypermobility. The alignment 
impairments that reached consensus were a Trendelenburg sign, dynamic knee 
valgus, lumbar lordosis, over-pronation and thoracic kyphosis. The flexibility 
impairments that reached consensus were abdominal wall laxity, and tightness in 
hip flexors, lumbar extensors, iliotibial band and hamstrings. The risk factors 
for pain in postpartum runners were muscular imbalance, poor lumbopelvic 
control, too much too soon, life stressors, pain during pregnancy and pelvic 
floor trauma.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a framework for clinicians to understand pain in 
postpartum runners and that can be investigated in future cohort studies.

Background: Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) is common among 
people with multiple sclerosis (MS) with a pooled prevalence of 68.41% using 
self-report measures and 63.95% using urodynamic studies. Transcutaneous tibial 
nerve stimulation (TTNS) is a non-invasive option to manage bladder storage 
symptoms; however, the potential efficacy of TTNS among people with MS is based 
on a small number of studies with the absence of high-quality evidence relating 
to efficacy, and lack of clarity of the optimal electrical stimulation 
parameters and frequency, duration and number of treatment sessions. This study 
aims to assess whether TTNS is feasible and acceptable as a treatment for 
bladder storage symptoms in people with MS. Methods: We will use a single-arm 
experimental study to explore the feasibility and acceptability of TTNS in the 
treatment of bladder storage symptoms in MS. The CONSORT extension for pilot and 
feasibility studies will be followed to standardise the conduct and reporting of 
the study. The recruitment plan is twofold: 1) Open recruitment for people with 
MS through MS Ireland's communication channels; 2) recruitment from a 
convenience sample of people with MS who have previously participated in a 
qualitative interview study of urinary symptoms. We will assess 
recruitment/retention rates, the urinary symptoms changes and the effect on 
quality of life pre and post intervention using ICIQ-OAB, 3-day bladder diary, 
King's Health Questionnaire and collect self-reported data on adherence and 
adverse events. Acceptability of using TTNS will be evaluated at the end of 
intervention. This study has been reviewed and approved by the Education and 
Health Science's Faculty Research Ethics Committee, University of Limerick 
[2020_06_07_EHS].  Conclusion: It is anticipated that assessing the feasibility 
and acceptability of TTNS for storage bladder symptoms in MS will inform the 
development of a definitive randomised trial. Trial registration:

IMPORTANCE: Genomic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) in 
unselected women offers an opportunity to prevent cancer morbidity and 
mortality, but the potential clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of such 
screening have not been well studied.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime incremental incidence of HBOC and the 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost-effectiveness of HBOC 
genomic screening in an unselected population vs family history-based testing.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this study conducted from October 27, 
2017, to May 3, 2020, a decision analytic Markov model was developed that 
included health states for precancer, for risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and 
risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), for earlier- and later-stage HBOC, 
after cancer, and for death. A complimentary cascade testing module was also 
developed to estimate outcomes in first-degree relatives. Age-specific RRM and 
RRSO uptake probabilities were estimated from the Geisinger MyCode Community 
Health Initiative and published sources. Parameters including RRM and RRSO 
effectiveness, variant-specific cancer risk, costs, and utilities were derived 
from published sources. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to 
evaluate model assumptions and uncertainty.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime cancer incidence, QALYs, life-years, and 
direct medical costs for genomic screening in an unselected population vs family 
history-based testing only were calculated. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was calculated as the difference in cost between strategies divided 
by the difference in QALYs between strategies. Earlier-stage and later-stage 
cancer cases prevented and total cancer cases prevented were also calculated.
RESULTS: The model found that population screening of 30-year-old women was 
associated with 75 (95% credible range [CR], 60-90) fewer overall cancer cases 
and 288 QALYs (95% CR, 212-373 QALYs) gained per 100 000 women screened, at an 
incremental cost of $25 million (95% CR, $21 millon to $30 million) vs family 
history-based testing; the ICER was $87 700 (78% probability of being 
cost-effective at a threshold of $100 000 per QALY). In contrast, population 
screening of 45-year-old women was associated with 24 (95% CR, 18-29) fewer 
cancer cases and 97 QALYs (95% CR, 66-130 QALYs) gained per 100 000 women 
screened, at an incremental cost of $26 million (95% CR, $22 million to $30 
million); the ICER was $268 200 (0% probability of being cost-effective at a 
threshold of $100 000 per QALY). A scenario analysis without cascade testing 
increased the ICER to $92 600 for 30-year-old women and $354 500 for 45-year-old 
women. A scenario analysis assuming a 5% absolute decrease in mammography 
screening in women without a variant was associated with the potential for net 
harm (-90 QALYs per 100 000 women screened; 95% CR, -180 to 10 QALYs).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that population 
HBOC screening may be cost-effective among younger women but not among older 
women. Cascade testing of first-degree relatives added a modest improvement in 
clinical and economic value. The potential for harm conferred by inappropriate 
reduction in mammography among noncarriers should be quantified.
