outcome predictions. Specifically, early fusion was the most used technique in 
most applications for multimodal learning (22 out of 34 studies). We found that 
multimodality fusion models outperformed traditional single-modality models for 
the same task. Disease diagnosis and prediction were the most common clinical 
outcomes (reported in 20 and 10 studies, respectively) from a clinical outcome 
perspective. Neurological disorders were the dominant category (16 studies). 
From an AI perspective, conventional ML models were the most used (19 studies), 
followed by DL models (16 studies). Multimodal data used in the included studies 
were mostly from private repositories (21 studies). Through this scoping review, 
we offer new insights for researchers interested in knowing the current state of 
knowledge within this research field.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated to a high financial and disease burden, 
explaining a large proportion of expenditure of the health system in one year. 
The purpose of this study was to estimate long-term costs and health outcomes of 
recently diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes in Chile.
METHODS: Cost and consequence study based on mathematical discrete event 
simulation (DES) model. We modelled expected costs (USD) and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) from diagnosis to death (or the age of 95) of a hypothetical 
cohort of 100,000 incident cases, simulated based on the Chilean National Health 
Survey 2018. The incidence of twelve complications was estimated assuming the 
hazard functions provided by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study. We 
explore heterogeneity across patients based on their baseline risk covariates 
and their impact on costs and QALYs.
RESULTS: The expected cost and QALY of a recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes 
patient in Chile were USD 8660 and 12.44 QALYs. Both costs and QALYs were 
independently determined by baseline risk and the patient's life expectancy from 
the diagnosis. Length of life since diagnosis showed the major impact on costs 
(5.2% increase for every additional year). Myocardial infarction was the most 
frequent complication (47.4%) and the most frequent cause of death.
CONCLUSION: Diabetes type 2 determines a significant expenditure of the health 
system and substantial health losses. Although the control of cardiovascular 
risk factors and the metabolic control of the disease, both have an important 
impact on costs and outcomes, the main impact is achieved by postponing the age 
of onset of the disease.

Aging constitutes progressive physiological changes in an organism. These 
changes alter the normal biological functions, such as the ability to manage 
metabolic stress, and eventually lead to cellular senescence. The process itself 
is characterized by nine hallmarks: genomic instability, telomere attrition, 
epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and 
altered intercellular communication. These hallmarks are risk factors for 
pathologies, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and 
cancer. Emerging evidence has been focused on examining the genetic pathways and 
biological processes in organisms surrounding these nine hallmarks. From here, 
the therapeutic approaches can be addressed in hopes of slowing the progression 
of aging. In this review, data have been collected on the hallmarks and their 
relative contributions to aging and supplemented with in vitro and in vivo 
antiaging research experiments. It is the intention of this article to highlight 
the most important antiaging strategies that researchers have proposed, 
including preventive measures, systemic therapeutic agents, and invasive 
procedures, that will promote healthy aging and increase human life expectancy 
with decreased side effects.

On the slow path to improving the life expectancy and quality of life of 
patients post spinal cord injury (SCI), recovery remains controversial. The 
potential role of the regenerative capacity of the nervous system has led to 
numerous attempts to stimulate the SCI to re-establish the interrupted 
sensorimotor loop and to understand its potential in the recovery process. 
Numerous resources are now available, from pharmacological to biomolecular 
approaches and from neuromodulation to sensorimotor rehabilitation interventions 
based on the use of various neural interfaces, exoskeletons, and virtual reality 
applications. The integration of existing resources seems to be a promising 
field of research, especially from the perspective of improving living 
conditions in the short to medium term. Goals such as reducing chronic forms of 
neuropathic pain, regaining control over certain physiological activities, and 
enhancing residual abilities are often more urgent than complete functional 
recovery. In this perspective article, we provide an overview of the latest 
interventions for the treatment of SCI through broad phases of injury 
rehabilitation. The underlying intention of this work is to introduce a spinal 
cord neuroplasticity-based multimodal approach to promote functional recovery 
and improve quality of life after SCI. Nonetheless, when used separately, 
biomolecular therapeutic approaches have been shown to have modest outcomes.

One of the major causes of a drastically shorter life expectancy and one of the 
most prevalent diseases in the world today is cancer. Given the data on the rise 
in cancer cases throughout the world, it is obvious that, despite the diagnostic 
techniques currently being used, there is a pressing need to develop precise and 
sensitive techniques for early diagnosis of the disease. A high degree of 
affinity and specificity towards particular targets is maintained by the short 
nucleic acid molecules known as aptamers. Aptamers outperform antibodies due to 
their unique benefits, such as their simplicity in synthesis and modification, 
lack of toxicity, and long-term stability. Utilizing an accurate recognition 
element and a robust signal transduction mechanism, molecular diagnostics can be 
extremely sensitive and specific. In this study, development of new 
single-stranded DNA aptamers against CEA for use in cancer diagnostics was 
accomplished using SELEX and NGS methods. As a result of 12 iterative SELEX 
rounds, nine aptamer candidates against CEA were developed. NGS comparative 
analysis revealed that round twelve had an enriched number of aptamers that were 
specifically bound, as opposed to round eight. Among the selected nine sequences 
characterized by bioinformatics analysis and ELONA, an aptamer sequence with the 
highest specificity and affinity for the target protein was identified and 
further examined. Aptamer sequence (6) was screened in a concentration-dependent 
assay, specificity analysis was performed, and its potential secondary and 
tertiary structures were predicted, which enabled us to test one of the possible 
putative interactions with CEA. Finally, aptamer sequence (6) labelled with a 
Cy5 fluorescent tag was used in confocal microscopy to observe its binding 
towards the CEA expressed in HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line.

Adult low-grade gliomas are a rare and aggressive pathology of the central 
nervous system. Some of their characteristics contribute to the patient's life 
expectancy and to their management. This study aimed to characterize and 
identify the main prognostic factors of low-grade gliomas. The six-year 
retrospective study statistically analyzed the demographic, imaging, and 
morphogenetic characteristics of the patient group through appropriate 
parameters. Immunohistochemical tests were performed: IDH1, Ki-67, p53, and 
Nestin, as well as FISH tests on the CDKN2A gene and 1p/19q codeletion. The 
pathology was prevalent in females, with patients having an average age of 56.31 
years. The average tumor volume was 41.61 cm3, producing a midline shift with an 
average of 7.5 mm. Its displacement had a negative impact on survival. The 
presence of a residual tumor resulted in decreased survival and is an 
independent risk factor for mortality. Positivity for p53 identified a low 
survival rate. CDKN2A mutations were an independent risk factor for mortality. 
We identified that a negative prognosis is influenced by the association of 
epilepsy with headache, tumor volume, and immunoreactivity to IDH1 and p53. 
Independent factors associated with mortality were midline shift, presence of 
tumor residue, and CDKN2A gene deletions and amplifications.

Background Context: The role of radiotherapy versus surgery in treating acute 
metastatic spinal cord compression (AMSCC) has changed over the years. Purpose: 
Our study evaluates neurological and functional outcomes following urgent 
surgery and radiotherapy (USFR) versus urgent radiotherapy alone in treating 
AMSCC. Study Design/Setting: A retrospective cohort of 54 patients with AMSCC 
with variable neurological deficits. Overall, 32 patients were treated with 
USFR, and 22 received urgent radiotherapy alone. Outcome Measures: Neurological 
status regarding the Asia and Frankel scores, continence and ambulation, and 
Kranofsky's functional score and patient life span comprised the outcome 
measures. Methods: This was a retrospective EMR study. Results: USFR and 
radiotherapy cohorts were similar in age, gender, tumor origin, and the number 
of spinal metastases. The most common cause of AMSCC was carcinoma of the breast 
(24.1%), followed by carcinoma of the lung (16.7%) and multiple myeloma (13%). 
Neurological status at AMSCC presentation was similar between cohorts regarding 
Asia and Frankel scores, continence and ambulation, and Kranofsky's functional 
score. Following USFR, 59.3% of the patients had a motor strength improvement, 
31.3% regained sphincter function, and 34.4% regained ambulation, while 90% of 
the patients treated by radiotherapy did not show any improvement. One patient 
under radiotherapy lost sphincter function. The treatment received did not 
affect the patient's survival. A subanalysis of patients with a short life 
expectancy, by Tomita and Tokuhashi scores, showed missed prediction in 29.4% of 
cases. Conclusion: The study supports the beneficial effect of UFSR compared to 
urgent radiotherapy alone in treating AMSCC in all subgroups. Early surgery 
improved function, motor strength, sphincter control, and ambulation without 
affecting life span. Prognostic scores failed to predict life span in almost 
one-third of the patients, requiring further investigation.

Long-Term IGF1 Stimulation Leads to Cellular Senescence via Functional 
Interaction with the Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein, TXNIP.

The growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) signaling pathway 
plays a major role in orchestrating cellular interactions, metabolism, growth 
and aging. Studies from worms to mice showed that downregulated activity of the 
GH/IGF1 pathway could be beneficial for the extension of lifespan. Laron 
syndrome (LS) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder caused by molecular 
defects of the GH receptor (GHR) gene, leading to congenital IGF1 deficiency. 
Life-long exposure to minute endogenous IGF1 levels in LS is associated with low 
stature as well as other endocrine and metabolic deficits. Epidemiological 
surveys reported that patients with LS have a reduced risk of developing cancer. 
Studies conducted on LS-derived lymphoblastoid cells led to the identification 
of a novel link between IGF1 and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a 
multifunctional mitochondrial protein. TXNIP is highly expressed in LS patients 
and plays a critical role in cellular redox regulation by thioredoxin. Given 
that IGF1 affects the levels of TXNIP under various stress conditions, including 
high glucose and oxidative stress, we hypothesized that the IGF1-TXNIP axis 
plays an essential role in helping maintain a physiological balance in cellular 
homeostasis. In this study, we show that TXNIP is vital for the cell fate choice 
when cells are challenged by various stress signals. Furthermore, prolonged IGF1 
treatment leads to the establishment of a premature senescence phenotype 
characterized by a unique senescence network signature. Combined 
IGF1/TXNIP-induced premature senescence can be associated with a typical 
secretory inflammatory phenotype that is mediated by STAT3/IL-1A signaling. 
Finally, these mechanistic insights might help with the understanding of basic 
aspects of IGF1-related pathologies in the clinical setting.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening condition associated with 
high mortality and substantial long-term morbidity. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a 
new pathogen that causes a disease with variable clinical manifestations. 
Although the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with 
hypercoagulopathy, patients may also present with cerebral hemorrhage, including 
SAH. The present paper reports a protocol for a scoping review that is aimed to 
provide a comprehensive report on existing literature by examining data on SAH 
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective is to evaluate the 
epidemiology, clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features of SAH in patients 
with COVID-19 and to explore the etiology and possible interventions in this 
pathology. Using appropriate search terms, we will search LitCOVID, the WHO 
database on COVID-19, and MedRxiv. The inclusion criteria are pre-defined. We 
will extract the data of eligible studies in standardized forms and will report 
the results in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We will 
provide information for clinicians, healthcare providers, and public health 
specialists.

Prevalence of asthma in older adults is growing along with increasing global 
life expectancy. Due to poor clinical consequences such as high mortality, 
advancement in understanding the pathophysiology of asthma in older patients has 
been sought to provide prompt treatment for them. Age-related alterations of 
functions in the immune system and lung parenchyma occur throughout life. 
Alterations with advancing age are promoted by various stimuli, including 
pathobionts, fungi, viruses, pollutants, and damage-associated molecular 
patterns derived from impaired cells, abandoned cell debris, and senescent 
cells. Age-related changes in the innate and adaptive immune response, termed 
immunosenescence, includes impairment of phagocytosis and antigen presentation, 
enhancement of proinflammatory mediator generation, and production of 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Immnunosenescence could promote 
inflammaging (chronic low-grade inflammation) and contribute to late-onset adult 
asthma and asthma in the elderly, along with age-related pulmonary disease, such 
as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis, due to lung 
parenchyma senescence. Aged patients with asthma exhibit local and systemic type 
2 and non-type 2 inflammation, associated with clinical manifestations. Here, we 
discuss immunosenescence's contribution to the immune response and the 
combination of type 2 inflammation and inflammaging in asthma in the elderly and 
present an overview of age-related features in the immune system and lung 
structure.

Surgical Tolerability and Frailty in Elderly Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted 
Radical Prostatectomy: A Narrative Review.

Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has now become the gold standard 
treatment for localized prostate cancer. There are multiple elements in decision 
making for the treatment of prostate cancer. One of the important elements is 
life expectancy, which the current guidelines recommend as an indicator for 
choosing treatment options. However, determination of life expectancy can be 
complicated and difficult in some cases. In addition, surgical tolerability is 
also an important issue. Since frailty may be a major concern, it may be logical 
to use geriatric assessment tools to discriminate 'surgically fit' patients from 
unfit patients. Landmark studies show two valid models such as the phenotype 
model and the cumulative deficit model that allow for the diagnosis of frailty. 
Many studies have also developed geriatric screening tools such as VES-13 and 
G8. These tools may have the potential to directly sort out unfit patients for 
surgery preoperatively.

Healthy ageing has become one of the most significant challenges in a society 
with an increasing life expectancy. Older adults have a greater prevalence of 
chronic disease, with the need for multiple medications to appropriately control 
these issues. In addition to their health concerns, ageing individuals are prone 
to loneliness, dependence, and economic issues, which may affect their quality 
of life. Governments and health professionals worldwide have developed various 
strategies to promote active and healthy ageing to improve the quality of life 
of older adults. Pharmacists are highly qualified health professionals, easily 
accessible to the population, thus playing a pivotal role in medication 
management. Their proximity to the patient puts them in a unique position to 
provide education and training to improve therapeutic adherence and identify 
medication-related problems. This paper aims to address the importance of 
Portuguese community pharmacists in the medication management of older adults, 
emphasising their intervention in health promotion, patient education, 
medication-related problems, deprescription, dose administration aids, and 
medication review and reconciliation. We also discuss home delivery services and 
medication management in long-term care facilities.

Life satisfaction is increasingly important for older cancer survivors as the 
global population ages and the life expectancy 29 of cancer survivors increases. 
This study sought to identify factors associated with physical symptoms, quality 
of life under treatment, and current life satisfaction in cancer survivors aged 
75 years and older receiving outpatient chemotherapy. Information about 
treatment for cancer survivors was collected from electronic medical records, 
and interviews were conducted to assess life satisfaction under treatment. 
Participants were older cancer survivors in Ishikawa, Japan. Of the 
participants, 80% lived on the Noto Peninsula. The average linear distance 
traveled for treatment was 40.7 km. The factors associated with patients' 
dissatisfaction with their current lives included general malaise (odds ratio: 
9.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.28-72.22) and being less happy now than when 
they were younger (odds ratio: 10.559; 95% confidence interval: 1.50-74.24). In 
outpatient cancer treatment for survivors aged 75 years and older, support 
should consider the distance to the hospital. As in past studies, general 
malaise was shown to have a negative impact on the lives of cancer survivors 
aged 75 years or older. Support providers should pay attention to patients' 
general malaise when providing support.

Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare neuro-developmental disorder caused by variants 
in genes of histone modification, including KMT2D and KDM6A. This review 
assesses our current understanding of KS, which was originally named 
Niikawa-Kuroki syndrome, and aims to guide surveillance and medical care of 
affected individuals as well as identify gaps in knowledge and unmet patient 
needs. Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from 1981 to 2021 to 
identify reports related to genotype and systems-based phenotype 
characterization of KS. A total of 2418 articles were retrieved, and 152 were 
included in this review, representing a total of 1369 individuals with KS. 
Genotype, phenotype, and the developmental and behavioral profile of KS are 
reviewed. There is a continuous clinical phenotype spectrum associated with KS 
with notable variability between affected individuals and an emerging 
genotype-phenotype correlation. The observed clinical variability may be 
attributable to differences in genotypes and/or unknown genetic and epigenetic 
factors. Clinical management is symptom oriented, fragmented, and lacks 
established clinical care standards. Additional research should focus on 
enhancing understanding of the burden of illness, the impact on quality of life, 
the adult phenotype, life expectancy and development of standard-of-care 
guidelines.

A rare and autosomal recessive premature aging disorder, Werner syndrome (WS) is 
characterized by the early onset of aging-associated diseases, including 
shortening stature, alopecia, bilateral cataracts, skin ulcers, diabetes, 
osteoporosis, arteriosclerosis, and chromosomal instability, as well as cancer 
predisposition. WRN, the gene responsible for WS, encodes DNA helicase with a 3' 
to 5' exonuclease activity, and numerous studies have revealed that WRN helicase 
is involved in the maintenance of chromosome stability through actions in DNA, 
e.g., DNA replication, repair, recombination, and epigenetic regulation via 
interaction with DNA repair factors, telomere-binding proteins, histone 
modification enzymes, and other DNA metabolic factors. However, although these 
efforts have elucidated the cellular functions of the helicase in cell lines, 
they have not been linked to the treatment of the disease. Life expectancy has 
improved for WS patients over the past three decades, and it is hoped that a 
fundamental treatment for the disease will be developed. Disease-specific 
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been established, and these are 
expected to be used in drug discovery and regenerative medicine for WS patients. 
In this article, we review trends in research to date and present some 
perspectives on WS research with regard to the application of pluripotent stem 
cells. Furthermore, the elucidation of disease mechanisms and drug discovery 
utilizing the vast amount of scientific data accumulated to date will be 
discussed.

Fall armyworm [Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith, 1797)] was first reported in 
the Americas, then spread to all the continents of the world. Chemical 
insecticides are frequently employed in managing fall armyworms. These 
insecticides have various modes of actions and target sites to kill the insects. 
Chlorantraniliprole is a selective insecticide with a novel mode of action and 
is used against Lepidopteran, Coleopteran, Isopteran, and Dipteran pests. This 
study determined chlorantraniliprole's lethal, sub-lethal, and 
trans-generational effects on two consecutive generations (F0, F1, and F2) of 
the fall armyworm. Bioassays revealed that chlorantraniliprole exhibited higher 
toxicity against fall armyworms with a LC50 of 2.781 mg/L after 48 h of 
exposure. Significant differences were noted in the biological parameters of 
fall armyworms in all generations. Sub-lethal concentrations of 
chlorantraniliprole showed prolonged larval and adult durations. The parameters 
related to the fitness cost in F0 and F1 generations showed non-significant 
differences. In contrast, the F2 generation showed lower fecundity at lethal (71 
eggs/female) and sub-lethal (94 eggs/female) doses of chlorantraniliprole 
compared to the control (127.5-129.3 eggs/female). Age-stage specific survival 
rate (Sxj), life expectancy (Exj) and reproductive rate (Vxj) significantly 
differed among insecticide-treated groups in all generations compared to the 
control. A comparison of treated and untreated insects over generations 
indicated substantial differences in demographic parameters such as net 
reproduction rate (R0), intrinsic rate of increase (r), and mean generation time 
(T). Several biological and demographic parameters were shown to be negatively 
impacted by chlorantraniliprole. We conclude that chlorantraniliprole may be 
utilized to manage fall armyworms with lesser risks.

Cultivar resistance is an essential management strategy for the Mexican rice 
borer, Eoreuma loftini (Dyar), in sugarcane in the USA, but resistance 
mechanisms are poorly understood. Resistance was evaluated among Louisiana's 
(USA) commercial sugarcane cultivars and experimental clones through field 
screenings, greenhouse trials, and a diet incorporation assay. Cultivars L 
01-299 and HoCP 85-845 had the lowest borer injury levels, while HoCP 00-950 and 
L 12-201 were among the most heavily injured in field and greenhouse trials. The 
variability of results between the two field trials suggests that a genotype × 
environment interaction might affect the expression of resistance. Oviposition 
did not differ among evaluated cultivars in the greenhouse choice study. Results 
from the no-choice experiment showed that neonatal establishment differed among 
cultivars by up to 3-fold. In a diet incorporation assay, all cultivars reduced 
larval weight up to 86.5% and increased days to pupation by 1.8-fold relative to 
the diet-only control. Collectively, these results suggest that Louisiana's 
sugarcane breeding germplasm contains various resistance levels to E. loftini, 
emphasizing the importance of screening cultivars before they are released to 
growers. Future studies should try to determine the influence of environmental 
factors on resistance expression.

The use of resistant cultivars is an efficient management strategy against S. 
nonagrioides. The effects of different sugarcane cultivars, CP48-103, CP57-614, 
CP69-1062, CP73-21, SP70-1143, and IRC99-02 were evaluated on the oviposition 
preference (free-choice assay), life history, and life table parameters of S. 
nonagrioides at 27 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5% RH and a photoperiod of 16: 8 (L: D) h. The 
longest and shortest developmental times were on cultivars SP70-1143 and 
CP48-103, respectively. The oviposition preference of S. nonagrioides was the 
highest on cultivars CP48-103 and CP69-1062, and negatively correlated with the 
shoot trichome density and shoot rind hardness of the cultivars. The highest 
intrinsic rate of increase of S. nonagrioides was on cultivar CP48-103 and the 
lowest was on cultivar SP70-1143. The shortest mean generation time was on 
CP48-103 and the longest was on SP70-1143. The results indicate that cultivars 
CP48-103 and CP69-1062 were susceptible, and cultivar SP70-1143 was partially 
resistant against S. nonagrioides. This information could be useful for 
developing integrated management programs of S. nonagrioides, such as the use of 
resistant cultivars to reduce the damage caused by this pest in sugarcane 
fields.

Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a 
polyphagous insect pest of many important crops. To evaluate the influence of 
host plants on the biology and survival of the Pakistani population of S. 
frugiperda, we examined life table parameters of S. frugiperda raised on maize, 
sorghum, wheat, and rice. The development rate was significantly higher on the 
maize crop than on the other three host plants. Different larval diets affected 
development time and fecundity. S. frugiperda attained the fastest larval 
development (16 days) on maize and the slowest development (32.74 days) on rice. 
Adult females from maize-fed larvae laid 1088 eggs/female, those from 
sorghum-fed larvae laid 591.6 eggs/female, those from wheat-fed larvae laid 
435.6 eggs/female, and those from rice-fed larvae laid 49.6 eggs/female. Age 
stage-specific parameters also indicated the higher fecundity, higher life 
expectancy, and higher survival of S. frugiperda on maize plants than on the 
other three hosts. Larval diets had a significant varying effect on the finite 
and intrinsic increase rates, reflecting that maize was the most suitable diet. 
The findings of the present study are useful for predicting population dynamics 
especially in areas cultivating Poaceae crops, except maize, to develop 
sustainable integrated pest management strategies for this pest.

Role of Vitronectin and Its Receptors in Neuronal Function and Neurodegenerative 
Diseases.

Vitronectin (VTN), a multifunctional glycoprotein with various physiological 
functions, exists in plasma and the extracellular matrix. It is known to be 
involved in the cell attachment, spreading and migration through binding to the 
integrin receptor, mainly via the RGD sequence. VTN is also widely used in the 
maintenance and expansion of pluripotent stem cells, but its effects go beyond 
that. Recent evidence shows more functions of VTN in the nervous system as it 
participates in neural differentiation, neuronutrition and neurogenesis, as well 
as in regulating axon size, supporting and guiding neurite extension. 
Furthermore, VTN was proved to play a key role in protecting the brain as it can 
reduce the permeability of the blood-brain barrier by interacting with integrin 
receptors in vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, evidence suggests that VTN is 
associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, but its 
function has not been fully understood. This review summarizes the functions of 
VTN and its receptors in neurons and describes the role of VTN in the 
blood-brain barrier and neurodegenerative diseases.

Ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution is an important threat to human 
health. The aim of this study is to estimate the environmental burden of disease 
(EBD) for the German population associated with PM2.5 exposure in Germany for 
the years 2010 until 2018. The EBD method was used to quantify relevant 
indicators, e.g., disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and the life table 
approach was used to estimate the reduction in life expectancy caused by 
long-term PM2.5 exposure. The impact of varying assumptions and input data was 
assessed. From 2010 to 2018 in Germany, the annual population-weighted PM2.5 
concentration declined from 13.7 to 10.8 µg/m3. The estimates of annual 
PM2.5-attributable DALYs for all disease outcomes showed a downward trend. In 
2018, the highest EBD was estimated for ischemic heart disease (101.776; 95% 
uncertainty interval (UI) 62,713-145,644), followed by lung cancer (60,843; 95% 
UI 43,380-79,379). The estimates for Germany differ from those provided by other 
institutions. This is mainly related to considerable differences in the input 
data, the use of a specific German national life expectancy and the selected 
relative risks. A transparent description of input data, computational steps, 
and assumptions is essential to explain differing results of EBD studies to 
improve methodological credibility and trust in the results. Furthermore, the 
different calculated indicators should be explained and interpreted with 
caution.

Home monitoring examinations offer diagnostic and economic advantages compared 
to inpatient monitoring. In addition, these technical solutions support the 
preservation of health care in rural areas in the absence of local care 
providers. The acceptance of patients is crucial for the implementation of home 
monitoring concepts. The present research assesses the preference for a health 
service that is to be introduced, namely an EEG home-monitoring of neurological 
outpatients-using a mobile, dry-electrode EEG (electroencephalography) system-in 
comparison to the traditional long-time EEG examination in a hospital. Results 
of a representative study for Germany (n = 421) reveal a preference for home 
monitoring. Importantly, this preference is partially driven by a video 
explaining the home monitoring system. We subsequently analyzed factors that 
influence the behavioral intention (BI) to use the new EEG system, drawing on an 
extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The 
strongest positive predictor of BI is the belief that EEG home-monitoring will 
improve health quality, while computer anxiety and effort expectancy represent 
the strongest barriers. Furthermore, we find the UTAUT model's behavioral 
intention construct to predict the patients' decision for or against home 
monitoring more strongly than any other patient's characteristic such as gender,
