OBJECTIVE: To examine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary 
clinical efficacy of intrathecal nusinersen (previously ISIS-SMNRx), an 
antisense oligonucleotide designed to alter splicing of SMN2 mRNA, in patients 
with childhood spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
METHODS: Nusinersen was delivered by intrathecal injection to medically stable 
patients with type 2 and type 3 SMA aged 2-14 years in an open-label phase 1 
study and its long-term extension. Four ascending single-dose levels (1, 3, 6, 
and 9 mg) were examined in cohorts of 6-10 participants. Participants were 
monitored for safety and tolerability, and CSF and plasma pharmacokinetics were 
measured. Exploratory efficacy endpoints included the Hammersmith Functional 
Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory.
RESULTS: A total of 28 participants enrolled in the study (n = 6 in first 3 dose 
cohorts; n = 10 in the 9-mg cohort). Intrathecal nusinersen was well-tolerated 
with no safety/tolerability concerns identified. Plasma and CSF drug levels were 
dose-dependent, consistent with preclinical data. Extended pharmacokinetics 
indicated a prolonged CSF drug half-life of 4-6 months after initial clearance. 
A significant increase in HFMSE scores was observed at the 9-mg dose at 3 months 
postdose (3.1 points; p = 0.016), which was further increased 9-14 months 
postdose (5.8 points; p = 0.008) during the extension study.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study support continued development of nusinersen 
for treatment of SMA.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that in 
children with SMA, intrathecal nusinersen is not associated with safety or 
tolerability concerns.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the short-term and long-term effects of dichlorphenamide 
(DCP) on attack frequency and quality of life in hyperkalemic (HYP) and 
hypokalemic (HOP) periodic paralysis.
METHODS: Two multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials 
lasted 9 weeks (Class I evidence), followed by a 1-year extension phase in which 
all participants received DCP. Forty-four HOP and 21 HYP participants 
participated. The primary outcome variable was the average number of attacks per 
week over the final 8 weeks of the double-blind phase.
RESULTS: The median attack rate was lower in HOP participants on DCP than in 
participants on placebo (0.3 vs 2.4, p = 0.02). The 9-week mean change in the 
Physical Component Summary score of the Short Form-36 was also better in HOP 
participants receiving DCP (treatment effect = 7.29 points, 95% confidence 
interval 2.26 to 12.32, p = 0.006). The median attack rate was also lower in HYP 
participants on DCP (0.9 vs 4.8) than in participants on placebo, but the 
difference in median attack rate was not significant (p = 0.10). There were no 
significant effects of DCP on muscle strength or muscle mass in either trial. 
The most common adverse events in both trials were paresthesia (47% DCP vs 14% 
placebo, both trials combined) and confusion (19% DCP vs 7% placebo, both trials 
combined).
CONCLUSIONS: DCP is effective in reducing the attack frequency, is safe, and 
improves quality of life in HOP periodic paralysis.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: These studies provide Class I evidence that DCP 
significantly reduces attack frequency in HOP but lacked the precision to 
support either efficacy or lack of efficacy of DCP in HYP.

The nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus pyogenes genome was first 
determined in 2001, which inferred a proteome of 1,752 proteins (Ferretti, et 
al., 2001). The genomic sequencing of additional isolates showed that all 
streptococcal chromosomes are poly-lysogenized with bacteriophages (Sumby, 
Whitney, Graviss, DeLeo, & Musser, 2006), which account for approximately 10% of 
their genome content (Ferretti, et al., 2001). The number and types of prophages 
that are present in the genomes of different clinical isolates varies 
significantly, which suggests a stochastic process of co-evolution (Canchaya, 
Fournous, & Brüssow, 2004). Horizontally transmitted integrative conjugative 
elements, transposons, and insertion sequences also contribute to genomic 
variation within the species. Due to the extent of horizontal DNA transmission, 
S. pyogenes is thought to have a theoretically infinite pan-genome and—by 
extension—a theoretically infinite proteome (Desiere, McShan, van Sinderen, 
Ferretti, & Brüssow, 2001). Moreover, multiple protein isoforms can be derived 
from a single open reading frame (ORF) following post-translational 
modifications, such as truncation or phosphorylation, and each isoform may have 
a unique function. As a result, the complexity of an organism’s proteome is 
estimated to be at least two to three orders of magnitude greater than that of 
the genome (Figure 1) (Matthiesen & Jensen, 2008; Cain, Solis, & Cordwell, 
2014). The availability of the genome sequence of S. pyogenes and advances in 
mass spectrometry (MS) have greatly enhanced our ability to characterize 
proteins on a genome-wide scale. Proteomic studies of S. pyogenes have been 
motivated by the pursuit of answers to fundamental questions, such as: How are 
proteins trafficked to specific sub-cellular locations? What is the functional 
significance of protein localization? How does the proteome transition in 
response to changing conditions encountered in the host? What are the 
differences between streptococci associated with a localized infection, as 
compared to those associated with life-threatening invasive infections? What are 
the functional significances of interactions between streptococcal proteins and 
human host proteins? What physiologic changes in the proteome occur in response 
to the presence of antimicrobials? What are correlates of protective immunity? 
What Streptococcal proteins can be used to vaccinate against disease? What 
proteins elicit pathogenic antibodies? Answering these questions is important in 
developing new approaches to mitigate the morbidity and mortality associated 
with S. pyogenes. In this chapter, we focus on the advances in our understanding 
of the S. pyogenes proteome from the perspective shaped by results obtained 
using proteomics, or studies that have simultaneously characterized a set of 
proteins. We start by describing the methods that have been used to study the 
proteome and then discuss how these approaches have led to insights into the 
pathogen’s response to changing conditions, circumvention of the immune 
response, and the organization and regulation of extracellular proteins. 
Finally, we will review advances in identifying proteins that evoke auto- and 
protective immunity. Given the rapid pace at which various aspects of proteomic 
investigation are progressing, including instrumentation, workflow strategies, 
and bioinformatics, the characterization of the S. pyogenes proteome is, in many 
ways, just beginning.

College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of KCNQ1 polymorphisms on the efficacy of 
gliclazide in type 2 diabetic patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 443 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients 
were included in this study. After enrollment, patients went on an 8-week 
gliclazide monotherapy. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was measured before and 
after the treatment. Life-style information was collected by weekly follow-up. 
Genotyping of the two single-nucleotide polymorphisms was performed using the 
single base primer extension method. T-test, one-way analysis of variance, and 
Pearson χ-test were used to evaluate the effects of rs2237892 and rs2237897 on 
the FPG reduction and treatment success rate.
RESULTS: After 8 weeks of gliclazide therapy, the FPG decreased significantly 
from 10.9±2.8 to 7.4±2.2 mmol/l (P<0.001). Compared with the CC genotype, 
patients with CT or TT genotypes of rs2237897 achieved greater reduction in FPG 
(3.9±2.6 vs. 3.2±2.4 mmol/l, P=0.003; 33.9±19.0 vs. 27.7±17.4%, P<0.001) and a 
higher rate of treatment success (74.1 vs. 65.2%, P=0.042 for criterion 1; 61.1 
vs. 44.5%, P<0.001 for criterion 2, respectively), whereas no significant 
difference was found in the FPG reduction and treatment success rate among 
different genotypes of rs2237892.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that a common variant of KCNQ1, rs2237897, was 
associated with the efficacy of gliclazide after 8-week monotherapy in Chinese 
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. The FPG reduction and treatment 
success rate were significantly higher in carriers of CT and TT genotypes.

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-national study.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and incidence of osteoporosis (OP) and 
osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) in Korea and to investigate if 
socioeconomic status has an effect.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: As life expectancy increases, OP and related 
fragility fractures are also increasing. This presents a serious challenge, not 
only for health authorities but also for individuals, their families, and 
society overall. Determining the prevalence and incidence of OP and related 
fragility fractures is the first step in developing strategies to reduce their 
increasing disease burdens. Concurrently, we need to confirm whether people with 
low socioeconomic status are more susceptible to these diseases.
METHODS: Using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) 
database from 2008 to 2012, we estimated the annual prevalence and incidence of 
OP and OVF and investigated the differences according to socioeconomic status by 
National Health Insurance (NHI) beneficiaries and Medical Aid (MA) recipients.
RESULTS: In 2012, the standardized prevalence of OP in the NHI and MA groups was 
3968 and 6927 per 100,000, respectively (odds ratio, 3.83). The standardized 
incidence of OP in the MA group was significantly higher than in the NHI group 
in 2011 and 2012 (odds ratios, 2.34 and 2.19, respectively). In addition, the 
standardized incidence of OVF in the MA group in 2011 and 2012 was 408 and 389 
per 100,000, respectively, and the incidence in the MA group was significantly 
higher than in the NHI group (odds ratios, 4.13 and 4.12, respectively; 
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: We confirmed that the prevalence and incidence of OP and OVF in the 
MA group were higher than those in the NHI group. It showed that low income 
might be a significant factor related to OP and OVF.

PURPOSE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of primary chemoradiation 
therapy (CRT) versus transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for clinical N2, human 
papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a Markov model to describe the health states 
after treatment with CRT or TORS, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy or CRT 
in the presence of high-risk pathology (positive margins or extracapsular 
extension). Outcomes, toxicities, and costs were extracted from the literature. 
One-way sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed over a wide range of 
parameters, as were 2-way SA between the key variables. Probabilistic SA and 
value of information studies were performed over key parameters.
RESULTS: The expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)/total costs for CRT 
and TORS were 7.31/$50,100 and 7.29/$62,200, respectively, so that CRT dominated 
TORS. In SA, primary CRT was almost always cost-effective up to a societal 
willingness-to-pay of $200,000/QALY, unless the locoregional recurrence risk 
after TORS was 30% to 50% lower, at which point it became cost effective at a 
willingness-to-pay of $50-100,000/QALY. Probabilistic SA confirmed the 
importance of locoregional recurrence risk, and the value of information in 
precisely knowing this parameter was more than $7M per year. If the long-term 
utility after TORS was 0.03 lower than CRT, CRT was cost-effective over nearly 
any assumption.
CONCLUSIONS: Under nearly all assumptions, primary CRT was the cost-effective 
therapy for HPV-associated, clinical N2 OPC. However, in the hypothetical event 
of a large relative improvement in LRR with surgery and equivalent long-term 
utilities, primary TORS would become the higher-value treatment, arguing for 
prospective, comparative study of the 2 paradigms.

Cost-effectiveness assessment of lumpectomy cavity boost in elderly women with 
early stage estrogen receptor positive breast cancer receiving adjuvant 
radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Breast radiotherapy (RT) for elderly women with estrogen 
receptor positive early stage breast cancer (ER+ESBC) improves local recurrence 
(LR) rates without benefitting overall survival. Breast boost is a common 
practice, although the absolute benefit decreases with age. Consequently, an 
analysis of its cost-effectiveness in the elderly ESBC populations is warranted.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare cost-effectiveness of 
RT with or without a boost in elderly ER+ESBC patients. The ten-year probability 
of LR with boost was derived from the CALGB 9343 trial and adjusted by the 
hazard ratio for LR from boost radiotherapy trial data, yielding the LR rate 
without boost. Remaining parameters were estimated using published data.
RESULTS: Boost RT was associated with an increase in mean cost ($7139 vs $6193) 
and effectiveness (5.66 vs 5.64 quality adjusted life years; QALYs) relative to 
no boost. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for boost was $55,903 
per QALY. On one-way sensitivity analysis, boost remained cost-effective if the 
hazard ratio of LR with boost was <0.67.
CONCLUSIONS: Boost RT for ER+ESBC patients was cost-effective over a wide range 
of assumptions and inputs over commonly accepted willingness-to pay-thresholds, 
but particularly in women at higher risk for LR.

INTRODUCTION: Prior evidence found live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) more 
effective than inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children aged 2-8 years, 
leading CDC in 2014 to prefer LAIV use in this group. However, since 2013, LAIV 
has not proven superior, leading CDC in 2015 to rescind their LAIV preference 
statement. Here, the cost effectiveness of preferred LAIV use compared with IIV 
in children aged 2-8 years is estimated.
METHODS: A Markov model estimated vaccination strategy cost effectiveness in 
terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Base case assumptions were 
equal vaccine uptake; IIV use when LAIV was not indicated (in 11.7% of the 
cohort); and no indirect vaccination effects. Sensitivity analyses included 
estimates of indirect effects from both equation- and agent-based models. 
Analyses were performed in 2014-2015.
RESULTS: Using prior effectiveness data in children aged 2-8 years (LAIV=83%, 
IIV=64%), preferred LAIV use was less costly and more effective than IIV 
(dominant), with results sensitive only to LAIV and IIV effectiveness variation. 
Using 2014-2015 U.S. effectiveness data (LAIV=0%, IIV=15%), IIV was dominant. In 
two-way sensitivity analyses, LAIV use was cost saving over the entire range of 
IIV effectiveness (0%-81%) when absolute LAIV effectiveness was >7.1% higher 
than IIV, but never cost saving when absolute LAIV effectiveness was <3.5% 
higher than IIV.
CONCLUSIONS: Results support CDC's decision to no longer prefer LAIV use and 
provide guidance on effectiveness differences between influenza vaccines that 
might lead to preferential LAIV recommendation for children aged 2-8 years.

INTRODUCTION: Type 1 neurofibromatosis is one of the most common genetic 
diseases, with an incidence of 1/3500 live births. Its diagnosis primarily 
relies on the clinical features of the condition.
CURRENT KNOWLEDGE: The life expectancy of these patients is reduced by 10 years, 
on average, compared to the general population. Type 1 neurofibromatosis has 
been shown to increase the risk of various types of neoplasia, primarily those 
affecting the neural crest. In addition, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, 
and pulmonary hypertension have been observed during the third or the fourth 
decade of an adult's life.
PERSPECTIVES: There are only few case reports available that address the 
pulmonary complications of neurofibromatosis type 1. It is thus crucial to fully 
understand this rare disease and its potential complications in order to allow 
for early diagnosis so we are able to improve the quality of life and survival 
of those suffering from the condition.
CONCLUSIONS: The pulmonary complications of type 1 neurofibromatosis can be 
severe and life-threatening. Patients with this condition should thus undergo 
regular clinical visits and examinations to allow pulmonary complications to be

Surviving inhospitable periods or seasons may greatly affect fitness. Evidence 
of this exists in the prevalence of dormant stages in the life cycles of most 
insects. Here I focused on butterflies with distinct seasonal morphological 
types (not a genetic polymorphism) in which one morphological type, or form, 
delays reproduction until favorable conditions return, while the other form 
develops in an environment that favors direct reproduction. For two butterflies, 
Anaea aidea and A. andria, I tested the hypothesis that the development of each 
seasonal form involves a differential allocation of resources to survival at 
eclosion. I assayed differences in adult longevity among summer and winter forms 
in either a warm, active environment or a cool, calm environment. Winter form 
adults lived 40 times longer than summer form but only in calm, cool conditions. 
The magnitude of this difference provided compelling evidence that the winter 
form body plan and metabolic strategy (i.e. resource conservatism) favor long 
term survival. This research suggests that winter form adults maintain lowered 
metabolic rate, a common feature of diapause, to conserve resources and delay 
senescence while overwintering.

Twin studies have been adopted for decades to disentangle the relative genetic 
and environmental contributions for a wide range of traits. However, 
heritability estimation based on the classical twin models does not take into 
account dynamic behavior of the variance components over age. Varying variance 
of the genetic component over age can imply the existence of gene-environment 
(G×E) interactions that general genome-wide association studies (GWAS) fail to 
capture, which may lead to the inconsistency of heritability estimates between 
twin design and GWAS. Existing parametricG×Einteraction models for twin studies 
are limited by assuming a linear or quadratic form of the variance curves with 
respect to a moderator that can, however, be overly restricted in reality. Here 
we propose spline-based approaches to explore the variance curves of the genetic 
and environmental components. We choose the additive genetic, common, and unique 
environmental variance components (ACE) model as the starting point. We treat 
the component variances as variance functions with respect to age modeled by 
B-splines or P-splines. We develop an empirical Bayes method to estimate the 
variance curves together with their confidence bands and provide an R package 
for public use. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods accurately 
capture dynamic behavior of the component variances in terms of mean square 
errors with a data set of >10,000 twin pairs. Using the proposed methods as an 
alternative and major extension to the classical twin models, our analyses with 
a large-scale Finnish twin data set (19,510 MZ twins and 27,312 DZ same-sex 
twins) discover that the variances of the A, C, and E components for body mass 
index (BMI) change substantially across life span in different patterns and the 
heritability of BMI drops to ∼50% after middle age. The results further indicate 
that the decline of heritability is due to increasing unique environmental 
variance, which provides more insights into age-specific heritability of BMI and 
evidence ofG×Einteractions. These findings highlight the fundamental importance 
and implication of the proposed models in facilitating twin studies to 
investigate the heritability specific to age and other modifying factors.

BACKGROUND: Rural South Africa (SA) is undergoing a rapid health transition 
characterized by increases in non-communicable diseases; stroke in particular. 
Knowledge of the relative contribution of modifiable risk factors on disease 
occurrence is needed for public health prevention efforts and community-oriented 
health promotion. Our aim was to estimate the burden of stroke in rural SA that 
is attributable to high blood pressure, excess weight and high blood glucose 
using World Health Organization's comparative risk assessment (CRA) framework.
METHODS: We estimated current exposure distributions of the risk factors in 
rural SA using 2010 data from the Agincourt health and demographic surveillance 
system (HDSS). Relative risks of stroke per unit of exposure were obtained from 
the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. We used data from the Agincourt HDSS to 
estimate age-, sex-, and stroke specific deaths and disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs). We estimated the proportion of the years of life lost (YLL) and 
DALY loss attributable to the risk factors and incorporate uncertainty intervals 
into these estimates.
RESULTS: Overall, 38 % of the documented stroke burden was due to high blood 
pressure (12 % males; 26 % females). This translated to 520 YLL per year (95 % 
CI: 325-678) and 540 DALYs (CI: 343-717). Excess Body Mass Index (BMI) was 
calculated as responsible for 20 % of the stroke burden (3.5 % males; 16 % 
females). This translated to 260 YLLs (CI: 199-330) and 277 DALYs (CI: 211-350). 
Burden was disproportionately higher in young females when BMI was assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: High blood pressure and excess weight, which both have effective 
interventions, are responsible for a significant proportion of the stroke burden 
in rural SA; the burden varies across age and sex sub-groups. The most effective 
way forward to reduce the stroke burden requires both population wide policies 
that have an impact across the age spectra and targeted (health 
promotion/disease prevention) interventions on women and young people.

According to the WHO, the proportion of people over 60 years is increasing and 
expected to reach 22% of total world's population in 2050. In parallel, recent 
animal demographic studies have shown that the life expectancy of pet dogs and 
cats is increasing. Brain aging is associated not only with molecular and 
morphological changes but also leads to different degrees of behavioral and 
cognitive dysfunction. Common age-related brain lesions in humans include brain 
atrophy, neuronal loss, amyloid plaques, cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy, 
vascular mineralization, neurofibrillary tangles, meningeal osseous metaplasia, 
and accumulation of lipofuscin. In aging humans, the most common 
neurodegenerative disorder is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which progressively 
impairs cognition, behavior, and quality of life. Pathologic changes comparable 
to the lesions of AD are described in several other animal species, although 
their clinical significance and effect on cognitive function are poorly 
documented. This review describes the commonly reported age-associated 
neurologic lesions in domestic and laboratory animals and the relationship of 
these lesions to cognitive dysfunction. Also described are the comparative 
interspecies similarities and differences to AD and other human 
neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and progressive 
supranuclear palsy, and the spontaneous and transgenic animal models of these 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: The negative symptoms of schizophrenia significantly impact on 
quality of life and social functioning, and current treatment options are 
limited. In this study the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
group body psychotherapy as a treatment for negative symptoms were compared with 
an active control.
DESIGN: A parallel-arm, multisite randomised controlled trial. Randomisation was 
conducted independently of the research team, using a 1 : 1 computer-generated 
sequence. Assessors and statisticians were blinded to treatment allocation. 
Analysis was conducted following the intention-to-treat principle. In the 
cost-effectiveness analysis, a health and social care perspective was adopted.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: age 18-65 years; diagnosis of schizophrenia with symptoms 
present at > 6 months; score of ≥ 18 on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
(PANSS) negative symptoms subscale; no change in medication type in past 6 
weeks; willingness to participate; ability to give informed consent; and 
community outpatient.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: inability to participate in the groups and insufficient 
command of English.
SETTINGS: Participants were recruited from NHS mental health community services 
in five different Trusts. All groups took place in local community spaces.
INTERVENTIONS: Control intervention: a 10-week, 90-minute, 20-session group 
beginners' Pilates class, run by a qualified Pilates instructor. Treatment 
intervention: a 10-week, 90-minute, 20-session manualised group body 
psychotherapy group, run by a qualified dance movement psychotherapist.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the PANSS negative symptoms subscale score at 
end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included measures of psychopathology, 
functional, social, service use and treatment satisfaction outcomes, both at 
treatment end and at 6-month follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 275 participants were randomised (140 body psychotherapy 
group, 135 Pilates group). At the end of treatment, 264 participants were 
assessed (137 body psychotherapy group, 127 Pilates group). The adjusted 
difference in means of the PANSS negative subscale at the end of treatment was 
0.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.11 to 1.17], showing no advantage of the 
intervention. In the secondary outcomes, the mean difference in the Clinical 
Assessment Interview for negative symptoms expression subscale at the end of 
treatment was 0.62 (95% CI -1.23 to 0.00), and in extrapyramidal movement 
disorder symptoms -0.65 (95% CI -1.13 to -0.16) at the end of treatment and 
-0.58 (95% CI -1.07 to -0.09) at 6 months' follow-up, showing a small 
significant advantage of body psychotherapy. No serious adverse events related 
to the interventions were reported. The total costs of the intervention were 
comparable with the control, with no clear evidence of cost-effectiveness for 
either condition.
LIMITATIONS: Owing to the absence of a treatment-as-usual arm, it is difficult 
to determine whether or not both arms are an improvement over routine care.
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with an active control, group body psychotherapy does 
not have a clinically relevant beneficial effect in the treatment of patients 
with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. These findings conflict with the review 
that led to the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
guidelines suggesting that arts therapies may be an effective treatment for 
negative symptoms.
FUTURE WORK: Determining whether or not this lack of effectiveness extends to 
all types of art therapies would be informative.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated secular trends in the age of stroke 
onset and stroke incidence in a low-income population in rural China.
METHODS: The study population was recruited from a population-based stroke 
surveillance study conducted in a township in Tianjin, China, from 1992 to 2014. 
The trends in mean age and incidence of first-ever stroke were assessed by sex 
and stroke subtype. Risk factor surveys were conducted in the same population in 
both 1991 and 2011.
RESULTS: A total of 1053 patients experienced first-ever stroke from 1992 to 
2014. The mean age of stroke onset in men significantly decreased by 0.28 years 
annually overall, by 0.56 years for intracerebral hemorrhage, and by 0.22 years 
for ischemic stroke (P<0.05). However, a similar trend was not observed in 
women. The age-standardized first-ever stroke incidence in the same population 
significantly increased across sex and stroke subtypes, increased by 6.3% 
overall, 5.5% for men, 7.9% for women, 4.6% for intracerebral hemorrhage, and 
7.3% for ischemic stroke (P<0.05) during 1992 to 2014. Concurrently, the 
prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, current smoking, and 
alcohol consumption increased significantly in young and middle-aged adults from 
1991 to 2011.
CONCLUSIONS: The age of stroke onset tends to be younger among low-income 
population in China after the dramatic increased incidence of stroke during the 
gradual extension of life expectancy of population in China. These findings 
suggested that stroke burden will continue to increase in the long time, unless 
the risk factors in low-income populations are effectively controlled.

Spondylodiscitis.

[Article in English, Spanish]

Spondylodiscitis is an infection of the spine that has been known since ancient 
times. Its incidence is rising, due to the increases in life expectancy and 
debilitating conditions. Its age distribution is bimodal, affecting persons 
younger than 20 years of age or persons aged 50-70 years. According to its 
origin, it is classified as pyogenic, granulomatous or parasitic, though the 
first form is the most common, usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus or 
Escherichia coli. The clinical presentation is insidious, resulting in a delayed 
diagnosis, particularly in tuberculous spondylodiscitis. The initial onset 
usually involves inflammatory back pain, though the disease may course with 
fever, asthenia and neurological deficit, these being the most severe 
complications. Diagnosis is based on clinical, radiological, laboratory, 
microbiological and histopathological data. Magnetic resonance imaging is the 
technique of choice for the diagnosis of spondylodiscitis. The differential 
diagnosis involves, among other conditions, intervertebral erosive 
osteochondrosis, tumour, axial spondyloarthropathy, haemodialysis 
spondyloarthropathy, Modic type 1 endplate changes and Charcot's axial 
neuroarthropathy. Treatment is based on eliminating the infection with 
antibiotics, preventing spinal instability with vertebral fixation, and ample 
debridement of infected tissue to obtain samples for analysis.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with an incidence that rises 
dramatically with age. The average age at diagnosis of breast cancer is 61 
years, and the majority of woman who die of breast cancer are age 65 years and 
older. Major improvements in public health and medical care have resulted in 
dramatic increases in longevity. The oldest old (those age 80 years and older) 
are a rapidly expanding group and now comprise 9 million members of the US 
population. The treatment of individuals who are age 80 years and older is 
complex and involves clearly defining the goals and value of treatment while 
also weighing risks, such as the potential effects of treatment on functional 
loss and quality of life. Limited evidence-based treatment guidelines exist for 
the caring of this older cohort of patients with breast cancer. Data from 
clinical trials that enroll primarily younger patients lack the information 
needed to estimate the likelihood of toxicities that can be life changing in 
older adults. Clinicians who make treatment recommendations should place the 
available evidence in the context of the patient's life expectancy and geriatric 
assessment results that include an evaluation of a patient's functional status, 
comorbidities, cognition, social support, nutritional status, and psychological 
state. Furthermore, these decisions should be placed in the context of the 
patient's goals for treatment, preferences, and values. This review summarizes 
the current literature and focuses on the role of geriatric assessment in 
treatment recommendations for patients age 80 years and older with early and 
metastatic breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: The COLOFOL trial, a prospective randomized multicenter trial 
comparing two follow-up regimes after curative surgical treatment for colorectal 
cancer, focuses on detection of asymptomatic recurrences. This paper aims to 
describe the design and recruitment procedure in the COLOFOL trial, comparing 
demographic characteristics between randomized patients and eligible patients 
not included in the study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: COLOFOL was designed as a pragmatic trial with wide 
inclusion criteria and few exclusion criteria, in order to obtain a sample 
reflecting the general patient population. To be eligible, patients had to be 75 
years or younger and curatively resected for stage II or III colorectal cancer. 
Exclusion criteria were hereditary colorectal cancer, no signed consent, other 
malignancy, and life expectancy less than 2 years due to concomitant disease. In 
four of the 24 participating centers, we scrutinized hospital inpatient data to 
identify all colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgery, in order to 
ascertain all eligible patients who were not included in the study and to 
compare them with enrolled patients.
RESULTS: Of a total of 4,445 eligible patients, 2,509 patients were randomized 
(56.4% inclusion rate). A total of 1,221 eligible patients were identified in 
the scrutinized hospitals, of which 684 (56%) were randomized. No difference in 
age or sex distribution was observed between randomized and nonrandomized 
eligible patients. However, a difference was noted in tumor location and stage 
distribution, with 5.6% more patients in the randomized group having colon 
cancer and 6.7% more patients having stage II disease.
CONCLUSION: Patients in the two study arms were not only demographically 
similar, but also similar to nonincluded eligible patients, apart from stage and 
localization. The analyses will be stratified by these variables. Taken 
together, we conclude that our trial results will be robust and possible to 
extrapolate to the target population.

Dumbbell-shaped hypoglossal Schwannomas of the 12th cranial nerve are extremely 
rare, and complete removal of these tumors is difficult, particularly in elderly 
patients with recurrent tumors. The present study reports the case of a 
61-year-old male with a giant recurrent dumbbell-shaped hypoglossal schwannoma 
that arose extracranially. The recurrent tumor was completely removed in a 
one-stage surgical procedure via the far lateral suboccipital approach in 
combination with the transcervical approach. To the best of our knowledge, such
