associations are explained by access to food stores, food shopping behavior, 
and/or psychosocial variables. Although different NSES buffers are highly 
correlated, researchers should conceptually determine spatial areas a priori.

The excellent properties of nanomaterials have been confirmed in many fields, 
but their effects on plants are still unclear. In this study, different 
concentrations of bismuth vanadate (BV) were added to the growth medium to 
analyze the growth of seedlings, including taproots, lateral roots, leaf 
stomata, root activity, and superoxide anion O2 .- generation. Gene expression 
levels related to root growth were determined by quantitative PCR in Arabidopsis 
thaliana. The results showed that BV promoted the growth of taproots and the 
development of lateral roots, enhanced the length of the extension zone in 
roots, increased the number and size of leaf stomata and root activity, reduced 
the accumulation of ROS in seedlings, and changed the expression levels of genes 
related to polyamines or hormones. At the same time, we investigated the 
antibacterial activity of BV against a variety of common pathogens causing crop 
diseases. The results showed that BV could effectively inhibit the growth of 
Fusarium wilt of cotton and rice sheath blight. These results provide a new 
prospect for the development of nanomaterial-assisted plants, which is expected 
to become one of the ways to solve the problem of controlling and promoting the 
development of plants. At the same time, it also provides a reference for the 
study of the effect of BV on plants.

BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is frequently performed in older adults, yet data on 
current use, and clinical outcomes of and follow-up recommendations after 
colonoscopy in older adults are lacking.
METHODS: This was an observational study using the New Hampshire Colonoscopy 
Registry of adults age ≥65 years undergoing colonoscopy for screening, 
surveillance of prior polyps, or evaluation of symptoms. The main outcomes were 
clinical findings of polyps and colorectal cancer and recommendations for future 
colonoscopy by age.
RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2019, there were 42,611 colonoscopies, of which 17,527 
(41%) were screening, 19,025 (45%) surveillance, and 6059 (14%) for the 
evaluation of symptoms. Mean age was 71.1 years (SD 5.0), and 49.3% were male. 
The finding of colorectal cancer was rare (0.71%), with the highest incidence 
among diagnostic examinations (2.4%). The incidence of advanced polyps increased 
with patient age from 65-69 to ≥85 years for screening (7.1% to 13.6%; p = 0.05) 
and surveillance (9.4% to 12.0%; p < 0.001). Recommendations for future 
colonoscopy decreased with age and varied by findings at current colonoscopy. In 
patients without any significant findings, 85% aged 70-74 years, 61.9% aged 
75-79 years, 39.1% aged 80-84 years, and 27.4% aged ≥85 years (p < 0.001) were 
told to continue colonoscopy. Among patients with advanced polyps, 97.2% aged 
70-74 years, 89.6% aged 75-79 years, 78.4% aged 80-84 years, and 66.7% aged 
≥85 years were told to continue colonoscopy (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Within this comprehensive statewide registry, clinical findings 
during colonoscopy varied by indication and increased with age. Overall rates of 
finding advanced polyps and colorectal cancer are low. Older adults are 
frequently recommended to continue colonoscopy despite advanced age and 
insignificant clinical findings on current examination. These data inform the 
potential benefits of ongoing colonoscopy, which must be weighed with the low 
but known potential immediate and long-term harms of colonoscopy, including 
cost, psychological distress, and long lag time to benefit exceeding life 
expectancy.

[Lifetime dental care: treatment for periodontally affected elderly].

[Article in Dutch; Abstract available in Dutch from the publisher]

Smit MJ, Putten GJV, Visser A.

Although many elderly remain healthy to an advanced age, apparently healthy and 
robust elderly can quickly become frail as a result of physical or psychological 
events. With frailty, oral health can quickly deteriorate and treatment is often 
difficult, with possible consequences for general health and quality of life. To 
prevent treatment dilemma's at an advanced age, it is advisable to think ahead 
when making a treatment plan for older patients and to aim for a surveyable oral 
situation, so in case of illness or care dependency, oral health can be 
maintained relatively easily. This so-called 'lifetime' dental treatment plan 
takes into account the various areas of frailty (physical, psychological and 
social), is predictable and can be modified, and takes life expectancy and 
general health into consideration. Lifetime dental treatment for the elderly, 
specifically the periodontally affected, has as yet rarely been discussed in the 
literature. This article represents a view of such treatment on the basis of 
clinical expertise.

Publisher: Hoewel een groot deel van de ouderen tot op hoge leeftijd gezond 
blijft, kunnen ogenschijnlijk vitale en robuuste ouderen door fysieke of 
psychische gebeurtenissen snel kwetsbaar worden. Met het kwetsbaar worden kan 
ook de mondgezondheid snel verslechteren en is behandelen vaak lastig, met 
mogelijke gevolgen voor de algemene gezondheid en kwaliteit van leven. Om 
behandeldilemma’s op latere leeftijd te voorkomen verdient het aanbeveling om 
bij het maken van een behandelplan bij oudere patiënten vooruit te denken en te 
streven naar een overzichtelijke mondsituatie, zodat ook bij het ontstaan van 
ziekte en zorgafhankelijkheid mondgezondheid relatief eenvoudig te behouden is. 
Dit zogenoemde ‘levensloopbestendig’ behandelplan houdt rekening met de 
verschillende kwetsbaarheidsdomeinen (lichamelijk, psychisch en sociaal), is 
voorspelbaar en modificeerbaar, en neemt de levensverwachting en algemene 
gezondheid in acht. Levensloopbestendig behandelen van ouderen, in het bijzonder 
ouderen met parodontale problemen, is tot op heden nauwelijks beschreven in de 
literatuur. Dit artikel is een visie hierop vanuit klinische expertise.

BACKGROUND: Deaths due to epidemics of silicosis still continue to be reported 
both in developing and developed countries, and silica exposure from different 
sectors remains an important occupational health concern.
AIMS: To identify characteristics of silicosis cases by focusing on a developing 
country and evaluate the frequency of and factors related to premature deaths 
and also reveal preventable causes of premature deaths in silicosis.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
METHODS: We reviewed the records of 9769 patients who were diagnosed with 
occupational diseases in İstanbul Occupational Diseases Hospital between 2006 
and 2017. According to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes, 
1473 silicosis cases were detected. The sociodemographic characteristics, job 
characteristics, comorbidities, serological, functional, and radiological data, 
and follow-up time were obtained from the medical records. Mortality data were 
gathered from The National Death Notification System of Ministry of Health.
RESULTS: The study examined 9769 cases diagnosed with an occupational disease, 
and 15.0% (n = 1473) of them were diagnosed with silicosis. The median age of 
silicosis patients was 40.0 years, and 26.9% of them were child labor when they 
started to work in dusty industries. Child labor was mostly seen among dental 
technicians (57.7%), denim sandblasters (46.4%), and miners (37.0%). In the 
follow-up period, 26.3% of Teflon sandblasters, 11.1% of coal miners, 8.6% of 
denim sandblasters had died before their average life expectancy, and the years 
of loss of life was 26.0 ± 11.6 years all over the group. Premature death was 
associated with occupation [hazard ratio (Teflon sandblasting): 3.93, CI: 
1.43-10.78; hazard ratio (marble production): 4.4, CI: 1.02-19.21]; large 
opacities in posterior anterior chest X-ray [hazard ratio: 2.14, CI: 1.18-3.86]; 
tuberculosis [hazard ratio: 2.60, CI: 1.42- 4.76]; and reduction in forced vital 
capacity (forced vital capacity% ≤80) during diagnosis [hazard ratio: 4.43, CI: 
2.22-8.83].
CONCLUSION: More than a quarter of silicosis cases are those who start working 
in dusty industries at an early age. Factors associated with premature death in 
patients with silicosis are patient occupation, large opacities on chest X-ray, 
tuberculosis, and pulmonary function loss at diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION: Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that 
inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. This drug raises concerns about the economic 
impact in scenarios with constrained resources. This study aimed to estimate the 
cost-utility of dupilumab plus standard care (SoC) vs SoC alone in adolescents 
and adults with severe asthma and eosinophilic phenotype.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was created to estimate the cost and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients with uncontrolled allergic 
asthma in Colombia. Total costs and QALYs of standard therapy (ICS + LABA), 
add-on therapy with dupilumab, were calculated over a lifetime horizon. Multiple 
sensitivity analyses were conducted. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) value of $19,000.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed dupilumab was associated with higher 
annual annual per-patient costs (US$5,719 for dupilumab and US$1,214 for 
standard therapy) and higher QALYs than standard therapy (fe  4.06 QALYs vs 
3.97 QALYs, respectively). . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimated 
was US$50,160 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Dupilumab is not cost-effective using a WTP of US$19000 per QALY 
threshold in Colombia. Our study provides evidence that should be used by 
decision-makers to improve clinical practice guidelines and should be replicated 
to validate their results in other middle-income countries.

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) methods are used in patients with both 
acute and chronic heart failure, who have exhausted other options for 
pharmacological or surgical treatments. The purpose of their use is to support, 
partially or completely, the failed ventricles and ensure adequate organ 
perfusion, which allows patients to restore full cardiovascular capacity, 
prolonging their life and effectively improving its quality. The three most 
popular devices include an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), percutaneous assist 
devices (including Impella, TandemHeart), and venoarterial extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). A multidisciplinary approach with the special 
participation of the Heart Team is required to determine the proper MCS 
strategy, the choice of the supporting method, and the time of its use. The 
studies published so far do not allow us to determine which MCS method is the 
safest and the most effective. Thus, the site experience and accessibility of 
the method seem to matter most today. MCS finds particular application in 
patients with acute coronary syndromes complicated by refractory cardiogenic 
shock, as well as in patients with acute heart failure of the high potential for 
reversibility. It can also serve as a backup for percutaneous coronary 
interventions of high risk (complex and high-risk indicated percutaneous 
coronary intervention [PCI], complex and high-risk indicated PCI [CHIP]). The 
use of appropriate supportive drugs, precise hemodynamic and echocardiographic 
monitoring, as well as optimal non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, are 
extremely important in the management of a patient with MCS. The most serious 
complications of MCS include bleeding, thromboembolic events, as well as 
infections, and hemolysis.

BACKGROUND: With increasing global life expectancy, the number of major 
surgeries performed on aged adults invariably increases. This study aimed to 
examine the effectiveness of a structured prehabilitative program for aged 
colorectal cancer patients in improving short-term surgical outcomes.
METHODS: A prospective philanthropically sponsored Programme for Enhanced 
Elderly Recovery at Sengkang General Hospital (PEERS) was initiated in February 
2017 for patients ≥70-years-old who were due to undergo elective colectomies. 
These patients were put through a 2- to 4-week-long program before surgery, 
which included geriatric assessment, nutrition supplementation, and resistance 
training. They were compared with patients from a similar age group before PEERS 
was introduced (non-PEERS).
RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients, with a median age of 78.5 (70-93) years, were 
recruited from a single institution to undergo PEERS. Baseline characteristics 
between the groups were similar. There was no significant improvement of 
anthropometric and functional characteristics before and after PEERS. Duration 
of hospitalization was shorter in the PEERS group (9 vs 11 days, P = 0.01). Both 
groups had similar 30-days' morbidity rates (8.6% vs 17.4%, P = 0.26). The PEERS 
group had significant improvement in their median EuroQol-5 Dimension score 
(0.70 presurgery to 0.80 6-months' postsurgery, P = 0.01). After multivariate 
analysis, the average duration of hospitalization in the PEERS group was 6.8 
days shorter (P = 0.018; CI, 1.2-12.4) after adjusting for modality of surgery 
and complications. This represented a cost saving of USD$11,838.80.
CONCLUSION: A standardized prehabilitation program for aged adults reduced the 
duration of hospitalization, improved the quality of life after surgery, and 
reduced costs.

    Lancet Public Health. 2022 Jan;7(1):e6-e7.

BACKGROUND: The syndemic of injection drug use and serious injection-related 
infections is leading to increasing mortality in the USA. Although outpatient 
treatment with medications for opioid use disorder reduces overdose risk and 
recurrent infections, hospitalisation remains common. We evaluated the clinical 
impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of hospital-based strategies to address 
the US opioid epidemic.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to compare the cost-effectiveness 
of: standard hospital care-detoxification for opioids, no addiction consult 
service (status quo); expanded inpatient prescribing of medications for opioid 
use disorder, including bridge prescriptions (ie, medication until they can see 
an outpatient provider) when possible (medications for opioid use disorder with 
bridge); implementation of addiction consult services within the hospital 
(addiction consult services alone); and a combined medication for opioid use 
disorder with addiction consult services strategy (combined). We used clinical 
trials and observational cohorts to inform model inputs. Outcomes were 
life-years, discounted costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, 
hospitalisations, and deaths. We did deterministic sensitivity analyses on key 
model inputs related to costs and sequelae of drug use and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis to further address uncertainty.
FINDINGS: Among people who inject opioids in the USA, we estimated that 
expanding medications for opioid use disorder with bridge prescriptions would 
reduce hospitalisations and overdose deaths by 3·2% and 3·6%, respectively, and 
the combination of expanded medications with opioid use disorder along with 
addiction consult sevices would reduce hospitalisations and overdoses by 5·2% 
and 6·6%, respectively, compared with the status quo. Mean lifetime costs ranged 
from US$731 400 (95% credible interval 447 911-859 189 for the medications for 
opioid use disorder strategy) to $741 200 (470 930-868 551 for the combined 
strategy) per person. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per 
life-year gained, medications for opioid use disorder with bridge and combined 
strategies were cost-effective ($7600 and $14 300, respectively). A scenario 
that assumed ideal access to harm reduction services came to the same 
conclusions as the base case and our results were robust in deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
INTERPRETATION: The combined interventions of expanding hospital-based 
prescribing of medications for opioid use disorder and implementing addiction 
consult services could improve life expectancy, be cost-effective, and could be 
the basis for a comprehensive hospital-based strategy for addressing the opioid 
epidemic in the USA and countries with similar opioid epidemics.

BACKGROUND: Black men are disproportionately impacted by injuries in the United 
States. This disparity is glaring given that injury is one of the top ten causes 
of death. Injured Black men from disadvantaged neighborhoods experience higher 
injury mortality, years of life-expectancy loss, and psychological symptoms that 
persist after initial wounds have been treated. These injured men are typically 
transported to a hospital where they are medically stabilized and soon after are 
returned to the community. Black men are less likely to be discharged to 
comprehensive rehabilitation facilities, magnifying disparities in recovery from 
injury. While much research has examined individual characteristics that predict 
poor recovery from injury, fewer studies have focused on social and physical 
features of the environment and how they may impact the recovery of injury 
survivors.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe Black men's perceptions of 
how characteristics of their environment affect their recovery following serious 
injury.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of an existing data set consisting of 
semi-structured, qualitative interviews of 43 injured Black men in a 
northeastern city. The interviews were conducted three months following 
discharge from a large urban trauma center, and were audiotaped, transcribed 
verbatim, and de-identified. Thematic analysis consistent with the qualitative 
paradigm was used to identify themes.
RESULTS: Four themes were identified in injured men's narratives: challenges to 
recovery, feeling unsafe, efforts to increase safety, and resources for 
recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the importance of the role of community 
resources that can support injured men's recovery within their neighborhoods. 
Additional resources should be directed to survivors who return to disadvantaged 
communities after injury in order to minimize adverse emotional experiences that 
detract from recovery.

Overexposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (SUVR) can cause skin and eye 
adverse effects for outdoor workers. In this study, the burden of disease 
induced by occupational exposure to SUVR and its spatiotemporal trend at 
national and sub-national levels in Iran, 2005-2019 were assessed. The 
attributable burden of disease was assessed using the following five datasets: 
(1) distribution of occupational exposure to SUVR, (2) total incidences and 
deaths of health outcomes of SUVR exposure, (3) population attributable 
fractions of the health outcomes of SUVR exposure, (4) age-gender distribution 
of outdoor workers, and (5) disability-adjusted life year (DALY) calculation 
constants. During 2005-2019, the attributable DALYs increased from 2442 to 2907 
and the attributable DALY rate (per 100,000 workers) slightly decreased from 
11.94 to 11.91. The share of YLL in the attributable burden of disease was in 
the range of 43%-46%. Out of nine causes, about 90% of the attributable burden 
of disease in 2019 was related to cataracts (29.9%), malignant skin melanoma 
(27.4%), squamous-cell carcinoma (18.6%), and sunburn (17.2%). During the study 
period, the attributable DALY rate in women increased by 60.95% (from 5.04 to 
8.11) and in men decreased by 2.06% (from 13.03 to 12.76). The total 
attributable DALYs and DALY rate rose by age during 2005-2019. The contributions 
of population growth, risk-deleted DALY rates, exposure risk, and population age 
structure in temporal changes of the attributable burden of disease were 19.27%, 
9.13%, -1.35%, and -14.8%, respectively. The three highest attributable DALY 
rates in 2019 were observed in South Khorasan (21.28), Chahar Mahal and 
Bakhtiari (17.42), and Kordestan (17.26), respectively. The preventive 
interventions against SUVR overexposure, regular screenings, and early 
treatments with an emphasis on occupations with continuous sun exposure and 
provinces with increasing attributable DALY rates should be considered in the 
occupational health action plan in the country.

BACKGROUND: In insect societies, queens monopolize reproduction while workers 
perform tasks such as brood care or foraging. Queen loss leads to ovary 
development and lifespan extension in workers of many ant species. However, the 
underlying molecular mechanisms of this phenotypic plasticity remain unclear. 
Recent studies highlight the importance of epigenetics in regulating plastic 
traits in social insects. Thus, we investigated the role of histone acetylation 
in regulating worker reproduction in the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. We removed 
queens from their colonies to induce worker fecundity, and either fed workers 
with chemical inhibitors of histone acetylation (C646), deacetylation (TSA), or 
the solvent (DMSO) as control. We monitored worker number for six weeks after 
which we assessed ovary development and sequenced fat body mRNA.
RESULTS: Workers survived better in queenless colonies. They also developed 
their ovaries after queen removal in control colonies as expected, but not in 
colonies treated with the chemical inhibitors. Both inhibitors affected gene 
expression, although the inhibition of histone acetylation using C646 altered 
the expression of more genes with immunity, fecundity, and longevity 
functionalities. Interestingly, these C646-treated workers shared many 
upregulated genes with infertile workers from queenright colonies. We also 
identified one gene with antioxidant properties commonly downregulated in 
infertile workers from queenright colonies and both C646 and TSA-treated workers 
from queenless colonies.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that histone acetylation is involved in the 
molecular regulation of worker reproduction, and thus point to an important role 
of histone modifications in modulating phenotypic plasticity of life history 
traits in social insects.

BACKGROUND: Smokers present a higher prevalence and severity of periodontitis 
and, consequently, higher prevalence of tooth loss. Smoking cessation improves 
the response to periodontal treatment and reduces tooth loss. So, the aim of 
this study was to evaluate the efficiency in resources allocation when 
implementing smoking cessation therapy vs. its non-implementation in smokers 
with periodontitis.
METHODS: We adopted the Brazilian public system perspective to determine the 
incremental cost-effectiveness (cost per tooth loss avoided) and cost-utility 
(cost per oral-related quality-adjusted life-year ([QALY] gained) of 
implementing smoking cessation therapy. Base-case was defined as a 48 years-old 
male subject and horizon of 30 years. Effects and costs were combined in a 
decision analytic modeling framework to permit a quantitative approach aiming to 
estimate the value of the consequences of smoking cessation therapy adjusted for 
their probability of occurrence. Markov models were carried over annual cycles. 
Sensitivity analysis tested methodological assumptions.
RESULTS: Implementing the therapy saved approximately US$ 100 over the time 
horizon accompanied by a slightly better effect, both in CEA and CUA. 
Considering uncertainties, the therapy could be cost-effective in the most part 
of simulated cases, even being cheaper and more effective in 35% of cases in 
which the oral-health related outcome is used as effect. Considering a 
willingness-to-pay of US$100 per health effect, smoking cessation therapy was 
cost-effective, respectively, in 72% and 99% of cases in cost-utility and 
cost-effectiveness analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of smoking cessation therapy may be cost-effective, 
considering the avoidance of tooth loss and oral health-related consequences to 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: Medicines with limited evidence of effectiveness are prime candidates 
for disinvestment. However, investment in further research may be preferable to 
deimplementation, given that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, 
and research can inform formulary decisions. A case in point is liothyronine, 
which is sometimes prescribed to levothyroxine-treated patients who continue to 
experience hypothyroid symptoms. It is a putative low value medicine, associated 
with uncertainties in both clinical and cost-effectiveness. The aim was to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of liothyronine in this context, and estimate the 
value of conducting further research.
DESIGN: Cost utility and value of information analyses.
SETTING: Primary care within the National Health Service in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-four levothyroxine-treated patients with persistent symptoms 
of hypothyroidism.
INTERVENTIONS: Liothyronine plus levothyroxine versus levothyroxine alone.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained, and the expected monetary value of sample information.
RESULTS: 20/54 (37%) of patients who responded to the survey reported severe 
problems in carrying out usual activities of everyday living and 12/54 (22%) 
reported severe anxiety or depression symptoms. Mean (SD) utility was 0.53 
(0.23). The differences in expected total, 10-year costs and QALYs between a 
treatment strategy of liothyronine/levothyroxine combination therapy, and 
levothyroxine alone, was £12 053 and 1.014, respectively. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £11 881 per QALY gained was sensitive to the price 
of liothyronine. The probability of liothyronine/levothyroxine combination 
therapy being cost effective at a threshold of £20 000 per QALY was 0.56. The 
value of reducing uncertainty in the efficacy of treatment was £3.64 m per year 
in the UK.
CONCLUSIONS: A definitive clinical trial to confirm clinical effectiveness may 
be preferable to immediate disinvestment, and would be justified given the value 
of the information gained far exceeds the cost.

The present study was conducted in Indian states to examine the effect of 
monetary and non-monetary factors on Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Life 
Expectancy at Birth (LEB) by using the panel regression model. In addition, an 
attempt was also made to analysis the unequal pattern of health infrastructure 
and services across states over time with the help of a composite index on 
health infrastructure and services. It was found that the index value of the 
best performing state Chhattisgarh is more than fourth six times that of the 
worst performing state. The study also showed that, despite the higher level of 
average per capita public health expenditure and moderately better health 
infrastructure, the COVID 19 induced death rate was high in Punjab, Sikkim, 
Delhi and Goa. The panel regression results revealed that, an average increase 
of 1% in the monetary factor, public health expenditure to Gross State Domestic 
Product ratio (PHEGSDPR), would decrease the average of IMR by about 10%. 
Moreover, the elasticity of IMR with respect to non-monetary factor, health 
infrastructure and services per 0.1 million population (HISPLP), was negative 
and significant. Likewise, the explanatory variables, HISPLP and PHEGSDPR have a 
positive and significant effect on the LEB.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and 
function. Epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, which integrate both 
genetic and environmental exposures, have been suggested to contribute to the 
development of sarcopenia. This study aimed to determine whether differences in 
the muscle methylome are associated with sarcopenia and its component measures: 
grip strength, appendicular lean mass index (ALMi), and gait speed.
METHODS: Using the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip, we measured DNA 
methylation in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies of 83 male participants (12 with 
sarcopenia) with a mean (standard deviation) age of 75.7 (3.6) years from the 
Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study (HSS) and Hertfordshire Sarcopenia Study 
extension (HSSe) and examined associations with sarcopenia and its components. 
Pathway, histone mark, and transcription factor enrichment of the differentially 
methylated CpGs (dmCpGs) were determined, and sodium bisulfite pyrosequencing 
was used to validate the sarcopenia-associated dmCpGs. Human primary myoblasts 
(n = 6) isolated from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from male individuals 
from HSSe were treated with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK343 to assess how 
perturbations in epigenetic processes may impact myoblast differentiation and 
fusion, measured by PAX7 and MYHC immunocytochemistry, and mitochondrial 
bioenergetics determined using the Seahorse XF96.
RESULTS: Sarcopenia was associated with differential methylation at 176 dmCpGs 
(false discovery rate ≤ 0.05) and 141 differentially methylated regions 
(Stouffer ≤ 0.05). The sarcopenia-associated dmCpGs were enriched in genes 
associated with myotube fusion (P = 1.40E-03), oxidative phosphorylation 
(P = 2.78E-02), and voltage-gated calcium channels (P = 1.59E-04). ALMi was 
associated with 71 dmCpGs, grip strength with 49 dmCpGs, and gait speed with 23 
dmCpGs (false discovery rate ≤ 0.05). There was significant overlap between the 
dmCpGs associated with sarcopenia and ALMi (P = 3.4E-35), sarcopenia and gait 
speed (P = 4.78E-03), and sarcopenia and grip strength (P = 7.55E-06). There was 
also an over-representation of the sarcopenia, ALMi, grip strength, and gait 
speed-associated dmCpGs with sites of H3K27 trimethylation (all P ≤ 0.05) and 
amongst EZH2 target genes (all P ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, treatment of human 
primary myoblasts with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK343 inhibitor led to an increase in 
PAX7 expression (P ≤ 0.05), decreased myotube fusion (P = 0.043), and an 
increase in ATP production (P = 0.008), with alterations in the DNA methylation 
of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and myogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that differences in the muscle methylome are 
associated with sarcopenia and individual measures of muscle mass, strength, and 
function in older individuals. This suggests that changes in the epigenetic 
regulation of genes may contribute to impaired muscle function in later life.

People with intellectual disability or psychiatric disorders are commonly 
excluded from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) because of explicit exclusion 
to the trials or because of inaccessible research protocols. We analyzed the 
exclusion rate of persons with cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and 
inability to give informed consent in interventional RCTs about the first 10 
causes of global DALYs (disability- adjusted life-years) according to the Global 
Burden of Disease Study (GBD) utilizing the website Clinicaltrials.gov. A total 
of 2809 studies in the 10 selected categories were reviewed. "Cognitive 
impairment" was present in 488 (17.4%) studies, "Behavioural and psychiatric 
disorders" was present in 616 (21.9%) studies, "Inability to grant informed 
consent" was present in 498 (17.7%) studies and the three explicit criteria were 
present, alone or in combination, in 1076 studies (38.3%). Other 
disability-related exclusion criteria were considered to be implicit exclusion 
criteria and were present in 1233 (43.9%) studies. A judgement was made on the 
correlation between the exclusion criteria and the primary objectives of the 
studies analyzed. The low level of representation of people with disabilities in 
RCTs, in addition to being an ethical problem, is a limitation of scientific 
knowledge because it considerably reduces the external validity of a significant 
part of medical research. There is a need to review the way scientific research 
designs are constructed, seeking to promote greater inclusiveness of people with 
disabilities.

INTRODUCTION: Morbid obesity is a disease with multiple comorbidities and 
considerably limits the quality of life and life expectancy. Bariatric surgery 
is an effective therapeutic alternative in these patients; it acts on the 
decrease and / or absorption of nutrients, achieving a significant weight loss 
which is maintained over time. The objective of the study is to determine the 
long-term results, in terms of efficacy, regarding weight loss, the resolution 
of comorbidities and improvement in the quality of life of our patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study that comprised all patients 
consecutively undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery at our center over a 10 
year period. In all patients, the anthropometric and clinical data were 
collected prior to surgery and in subsequent protocolized visits after surgery. 
At the end of the follow-up, a BAROS questionnaire was used that recorded weight 
loss, the resolution of comorbidities, complications and the quality of life 
test completed by the patients.
RESULTS: 353 patients (303 GBPRY and 50 GV), 105 men and 248 women, with a mean 
age of 42.14 ± 10.16 years, BMI 48.63 kg / m2 and 68.5% had some comorbidity. 
The mean follow-up was 5.7 ± 2.6 years for 96.7% of the total number operated 
on. At the end of the follow-up the %EWL was 59.00 ± 19.50, %EBMIL 68.15 ± 
22.94, the final BMI 32.65 ± 5.98 and 31.3% of the patients had %EWL ≤ 50. The 
resolution of comorbidities was as follows: 48.7% hypertension, 70.3% Type 2 
Diabetes, 82.6% DLP and 71.6% SAHS. The result of the quality of life test was 
1.51 ± 0.93, with 67.2% of patients reporting good or very good quality, with 
the highest score being for self-esteem, followed by physical condition, work 
and social activity, and the lowest being for sexual quality of life in that 
only 40.3% reported an improvement. The BAROS score was 4.35 ± 2.06 with 84.7% 
of the patients in the good to excellent range, while 91.2% of all patients 
would undergo surgery again.
CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is an effective technique for reducing weight, 
resolving comorbidities and improving the quality of life of patients with 
morbid obesity, mainly in its physical aspect. In our series, the percentage of 
follow-up and average time was within the range of established quality 
standards.
