BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated the safety and short-term success 
of nonoperative management in children with acute, uncomplicated appendicitis. 
Nonoperative management spares the patients and their family the upfront cost 
and discomfort of surgery, but also risks recurrent appendicitis.
METHODS: Using decision-tree software, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
nonoperative management versus routine laparoscopic appendectomy. Model 
variables were abstracted from a review of the literature, Healthcare Cost and 
Utilization Project, and Medicare Physician Fee schedule. Model uncertainty was 
assessed using both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We used a 
$100,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) threshold for cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Operative management cost $11,119 and yielded 23.56 quality-adjusted 
life months (QALMs). Nonoperative management cost $2277 less than operative 
management, but yielded 0.03 fewer QALMs. The incremental cost-to-effectiveness 
ratio of routine laparoscopic appendectomy was $910,800 per QALY gained. This 
greatly exceeds the $100,000/QALY threshold and was not cost-effective. One-way 
sensitivity analysis found that operative management would become cost-effective 
if the 1-year recurrence rate of acute appendicitis exceeded 39.8%. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that nonoperative management was 
cost-effective in 92% of simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our model, nonoperative management is more cost-effective 
than routine laparoscopic appendectomy for children with acute, uncomplicated 
appendicitis.

Neural circuit formation is a critical process in brain development. Axon 
guidance molecules, their receptors, and intracellular mediators are important 
to establish neural circuits. Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are 
known intercellular mediators of a number of repulsive guidance molecules. 
Studies of mutant mice suggest roles of CRMPs in dendrite development. However, 
molecular mechanisms of CRMP-mediated dendritic development remain to elucidate. 
In this study, we show abnormal orientation of basal dendrites (extension to 
deeper side) of layer V pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex of CRMP4-/- 
mice. Moreover, we observed severe abnormality in orientation of the basal 
dendrites of these neurons in double knockout of CRMP1 and 4, suggesting 
redundant functions of these two genes. Redundant gene functions were also 
observed in proximal bifurcation phenotype in apical dendrites of hippocampal 
CA1 pyramidal neurons. These results indicate that CRMP1 and CRMP4 regulate 
proper orientation of the basal dendrites of layer V neurons in the cerebral 
cortex.

The rise in human life expectancy has involved declines in intrinsic and 
extrinsic mortality processes associated, respectively, with senescence and 
environmental challenges. To better understand the factors driving this rise, we 
apply a two-process vitality model to data from the Human Mortality Database. 
Model parameters yield intrinsic and extrinsic cumulative survival curves from 
which we derive intrinsic and extrinsic expected life spans (ELS). Intrinsic 
ELS, a measure of longevity acted on by intrinsic, physiological factors, 
changed slowly over two centuries and then entered a second phase of increasing 
longevity ostensibly brought on by improvements in old-age death reduction 
technologies and cumulative health behaviors throughout life. The model 
partitions the majority of the increase in life expectancy before 1950 to 
increasing extrinsic ELS driven by reductions in environmental, event-based 
health challenges in both childhood and adulthood. In the post-1950 era, the 
extrinsic ELS of females appears to be converging to the intrinsic ELS, whereas 
the extrinsic ELS of males is approximately 20 years lower than the intrinsic 
ELS.

BACKGROUND: To determine the cost-effectiveness of In-Home Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy (IH-CBT) for low-income mothers enrolled in a home visiting program.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using results from a clinical 
trial of IH-CBT and standard of care for depression derived from the literature. 
A probabilistic, patient-level Markov model was developed to determine Quality 
Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Costs were determined using the Medical Expenditure 
Panel Survey. A three-year time horizon and payer perspective were used. 
Sensitivity analyses were employed to determine robustness of the model.
RESULTS: IH-CBT was cost-effective relative to standard of care. IH-CBT was 
expected to be cost-effective at a three-year time horizon 99.5%, 99.7%, and 
99.9% of the time for willingness-to-pay thresholds of US$25,000, US$50,000, and 
US$100,000, respectively. Patterns were upheld at one-year and five-year time 
horizons. Over the three-year time horizon, mothers receiving IH-CBT were 
expected to have 345.6 fewer days of depression relative to those receiving 
standard home visiting and treatment in the community.
CONCLUSIONS: IH-CBT is a more cost-effective treatment for low-income, depressed 
mothers than current standards of practice. These findings add to the growing 
literature demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of CBT for depression, and 
expand it to cover new mothers. From a payer perspective, IH-CBT is a sound 
option for treatment of depressed, low-income mothers. Limitations include a 
restricted time horizon and estimating of standard of care costs.

OBJECTIVE: Although geriatric syndromes have been studied extensively, their 
interactions with one another and their accumulated effects on life expectancy 
are less frequently discussed. This study examined whether geriatric syndromes 
and their cumulative effects are associated with risks of mortality in 
community-dwelling older adults.
METHODS: Data were collected from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study in Aging in 
2003, and the participant survival status was followed until December 31, 2007. 
A total of 2744 participants aged ≥65 years were included in this retrospective 
cohort study; 634 died during follow-up. Demographic factors, comorbidities, 
health behaviors, and geriatric syndromes, including underweight, falls, 
functional impairment, depressive condition, and cognitive impairment, were 
assessed. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the probability of 
survival according to the cumulative number of geriatric syndromes.
RESULTS: The prevalence of geriatric syndromes increased with age. Mortality was 
significantly associated with age ≥75 years; male sex; ≤6 years of education; 
history of stroke, malignancy; smoking; not drinking alcohol; and not exercising 
regularly. Geriatric syndromes, such as underweight, functional disability, and 
depressive condition, contributed to the risk of mortality. The accumulative 
model of geriatric syndromes also predicted higher risks of mortality (N = 1, HR 
1.50, 95% CI 1.19-1.89; N = 2, HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.25-2.29; N ≥ 3, HR 2.43, 95% CI 
1.62-3.66).
CONCLUSIONS: Community-dwelling older adults who were male, illiterate, 
receiving institutional care, underweight, experiencing a depressive condition, 
functionally impaired, and engaging in poor health behavior were more likely to 
have a higher risk of mortality. The identification of geriatric syndromes might 
help to improve comprehensive care for community-dwelling older adults.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the national trends in treatment of localized renal tumors 
among older patients with limited life expectancy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database, we identified older 
patients (≥70y) diagnosed with T1 renal cell carcinoma from 2002 to 2011. 
Primary outcome was the initial treatment-partial nephrectomy (PN), radical 
nephrectomy, EM, and ablation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis 
stratified by tumor size (<2, 2-3.9, or 4-7cm) and age groups (70-79 and ≥80y) 
was used to identify covariates associated with different treatments.
RESULTS: Among 41,518 older patients with T1 renal cell carcinoma renal tumors, 
most were treated with radical nephrectomy (59.0%) followed by PN (20.0%) and 
ablation (8.4%). Only 12.6% were managed by EM. Among older patients aged 70 to 
79 years with renal tumors 2 to 3.9cm, PN was used more frequently in 2008 to 
2009 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32; P = 0.001) and 2010 to 2011 (OR = 1.87; P<0.001) 
compared to 2002 to 2003 and at academic hospitals (OR = 1.91; P<0.001) compared 
to community hospitals. Similar trends were observed for patients aged 70 to 79 
years with 4 to 7cm tumors and for patients aged≥80 years across renal tumor 
sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with localized renal tumors and limited life 
expectancy, most are treated surgically with a growing use of PN. A smaller 
proportion of older patients are managed by EM in the United States.

BACKGROUND: The management of low-risk micropapillary thyroid cancer <1 cm in 
size has come into question, because recent data have shown that nonoperative 
active surveillance of micropapillary thyroid cancer is a viable alternative to 
hemithyroidectomy. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to help decide 
between observation versus operation.
METHODS: We constructed Markov models for active surveillance and 
hemithyroidectomy. The reference case was a 40-year-old patient with recently 
diagnosed, low-risk micropapillary thyroid cancer. Costs and health utilities 
were determined using extensive literature review. The willingness-to-pay 
threshold was set at $100,000/quality-adjusted life year gained. Deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty 
in the model's variables.
RESULTS: Active surveillance is dominant (less expensive and more 
quality-adjusted life years) for a health utility <0.01 below that for 
disease-free, posthemithyroidectomy state, or for a remaining life expectancy of 
<2 years. For a utility difference ≥0.02, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (the ratio of the difference in costs between active surveillance and 
hemithyroidectomy divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life years) for 
hemithyroidectomy is <$100,000/QALY gained and thus cost-effective. For a 
utility difference of 0.11-the reference case scenario-the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for hemithyroidectomy is $4,437/quality-adjusted life 
year gained.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of hemithyroidectomy is highly dependent on 
patient disutility associated with active surveillance. In patients who would 
associate nonoperative management with at least a modest decrement in quality of 
life, hemithyroidectomy is cost-effective.

"Is my older cancer patient on too many medications?" is a question that 
confronts many physicians. Increasing age is associated with an increase in 
comorbidity, and consequently an increase in the number of medications 
prescribed to provide symptomatic relief and prevent disease related sequelae. 
The use of multiple medications, often termed polypharmacy, is highly prevalent 
in older people with cancer. Polypharmacy is not necessarily inappropriate but 
has been associated with drug-drug interactions, use of potentially 
inappropriate medications and a range of adverse events. Specific medications 
for which the risks outweigh the benefits are considered inappropriate, 
particularly when safer alternatives exist. Additionally, the appropriateness of 
medication therapy for both cancer and non-cancer indications is dependent on a 
patient's life expectancy and treatment goals. A range of implicit and explicit 
tools are available to assist clinicians work as part of a multidisciplinary 
team to identify inappropriate or unnecessary medications. Inappropriate or 
unnecessary medications can be targeted for cessation. Deprescribing is the 
patient-centered process of reducing medications after consideration of 
treatment goals, benefits and risks, and medical ethics. A six step process for 
deprescribing in older patients with cancer is presented; 1) determine life 
expectancy and treatment goals, 2) review medications, 3) evaluate medication 
appropriateness, 4) identify medications to cease, 5) create a deprescribing 
plan, and 6) monitor and review. Although further research is required, there is 
an increasing body of research demonstrating that deprescribing inappropriate or 
unnecessary medications is feasible, can be done safely, and can improve patient 
quality of life.

The purpose of this study is to discuss a paradigm shift towards a broader 
understanding of physical activity (PA) as part of daily living and, therefore, 
a different approach for PA guidelines, research, and promotion. To this aim, we 
centered the discussion in two topics: 1) PA: from a restricted view to a 
broader phenomenon; and 2) Recommendations for PA: moving beyond minutes and 
dose-response. A holistic understanding of PA and its relationship with health 
is not possible unless it is considered values, meanings, and symbols that 
impregnate the human behavior linked to the modes of living of a given people. 
If we do believe that PA is a behavior essential to human life, we must align 
our actions to our speech. However, current guidelines, as well as in most 
policies and programs of PA is largely portrayed as a way to attain longer life 
expectancy and less diseases, which runs against our consolidated understanding 
of PA as part of our everyday life. New guidelines could focus on how, when, 
why, where, and with whom we include PA in our daily lives, based on a day-long 
approach, instead of how much we should do in order to prevent non-communicable 
diseases.

Ischemic Heart Disease in HIV: An In-depth Look at Cardiovascular Risk.

Although the incidence of cardiovascular diseases classically associated with 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has decreased considerably with 
antiretroviral therapy, cardiovascular risk, and especially ischemic heart 
disease, are higher in HIV-infected patients than in uninfected individuals. 
This is due to the interaction of patient-dependent factors with virus-dependent 
factors, as well as factors associated with antiretroviral therapy. With 
increasing of life expectancy and the chronicity of HIV infection, 
cardiovascular disease has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and 
mortality in HIV patients. In developed countries, the most common 
cardiovascular manifestation of HIV is ischemic heart disease. Currently, it is 
not uncommon to find HIV patients with acute coronary syndrome and, given the 
important pharmacokinetic interactions of antiretroviral drugs, it is important 
to know which cardiovascular treatments are safe in this group of patients. The 
ideal approach would be to mitigate the cardiovascular risk in HIV patients with 
specific primary prevention measures. All these issues are discussed in this 
review, which aims to aid clinical cardiologists faced with HIV patients with 
ischemic heart disease or with high cardiovascular risk in daily clinical 
practice.

BACKGROUND: The life-review experience (LRE) is a most intriguing mental 
phenomenon that fascinated humans from time immemorial. In LRE one sees vividly 
a succession of one's own life-events. While reports of LRE are abundant in the 
medical, psychological and popular literature, not much is known about LRE's 
cognitive and psychological basis. Moreover, while LRE is known as part of the 
phenomenology of near-death experience, its manifestation in the general 
population and in other circumstances is still to be investigated.
METHODS: In a first step we studied the phenomenology of LRE by means of 
in-depth qualitative interview of 7 people who underwent full LRE. In a second 
step we extracted the main characters of LRE, to develop a questionnaire and an 
LRE-score that best reflects LRE phenomenology. This questionnaire was then run 
on 264 participants of diverse ages and backgrounds, and the resulted score was 
further subjected to statistical analyses.
RESULTS: Qualitative analysis showed the LRE to manifest several subtypes of 
characteristics in terms of order, continuity, the covered period, extension to 
the future, valence, emotions, and perspective taking. Quantitative results in 
the normal population showed normal distribution of the LRE-score over 
participants.
CONCLUSION: Re-experiencing one's own life-events, so-called LRE, is a 
phenomenon with well-defined characteristics, and its subcomponents may be also 
evident in healthy people. This suggests that a representation of life-events as 
a continuum exists in the cognitive system, and maybe further expressed in 
extreme conditions of psychological and physiological stress.

BACKGROUND: Major Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disease with 
complications, mortality and serious pathology. Today, the life expectancy of 
patients with major thalassemia has increased along with therapeutic advances. 
Therefore, they need lifelong care, and caring for them would incur many costs. 
Being aware of the patients' costs can be effective for controlling and managing 
the costs and providing efficient treatments for the care of patients. Hence, 
this study was conducted to estimate the economic burden of the patients with 
major thalassemia.
METHODS: Totally, 198 patients with major thalassemia were randomly selected 
from among the patients with major thalassemia in Tehran, Iran in 2015. The 
economic burden of the patients was estimated from a social perspective and 
through a bottom-up, prevalence-based approach.
RESULTS: The average annual cost per patient was estimated $ 8321.8 regardless 
of the cost of lost welfare. Of this amount, $ 7286.8 was related to direct 
medical costs, $ 461.4 to direct non-medical costs, and $ 573.5 to indirect 
costs. In addition, the annual cost per patient was estimated $ 1360.5 due to 
the distress caused by the disease CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high costs of 
the treatment of patients with major thalassemia, adopting new policies to 
reduce the costs that patients have to pay seems necessary. In addition, making 
new decisions regarding thalassemia screening, even with higher costs than the 
usual screening costs, can be useful since the costs of treatment are high.

University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.

BACKGROUND: The presence of hair plays an important role in people's overall 
physical appearance and self-perception. As a result of increased life 
expectancy, the desire to look youthful plays a bigger role than ever.The use of 
medicinal plants is as old as mankind and the market will face many new products 
containing natural oils and herbs in coming years. In traditional Iranian 
medicine, many plants and herbal formulations are reported for hair growth as 
well as the improvement in hair quality. The aim of this article is to introduce 
effective medicinal plants in traditional Iranian medicine to prevent gray hair 
and advocate them as the new products.
METHODS: The present investigation is an overview study and has been codified by 
library search in the main sources of traditional Iranian medicine.
RESULTS: In traditional Iranian medicine, three types of formulations are 
proposed to prevent gray hair, namely (i) treatment compounds, (ii) preventive 
compounds, and (iii) hair dyes to color gray hairs. Our search showed that the 
main parts of a plant that is used in the treatment and preventive compounds are 
seeds and fruits. These are primarily in the form of topical oil or oral 
compound (electuary). The majority of plant parts used in hair dyes is from the 
fruit and/or leaves.
CONCLUSION: Natural products are highly popular and the use of plant extracts in 
formulations is on the rise. This is because synthetic based product may cause 
health hazards with several side effects. Considering the increased popularity 
of herbal drugs in hair care, it is worthwhile to conduct systemic investigation 
on the production and efficacy of these drugs. We trust that our investigation 
would encourage the use of traditional Iranian medicine in future hair care 
products.

Aim. For patients who have exhausted cephalic vein arteriovenous fistula (AVF) 
options, controversy exists on whether brachial-basilic AVF with transposition 
(BBTAVF) or a forearm arteriovenous graft (AVG) should be the next vascular 
access of choice. This study compared the outcomes of these two modalities. 
Methods. A retrospective study of 122 Asian multiethnic patients who underwent 
either a BBTAVF (81) or an AVG (41). Maturation time and intervention rates were 
analyzed. Functional primary, secondary, and overall patency rates were 
evaluated. Results. The maturation time for BBTAVFs was significantly longer 
than AVGs. There was also a longer deliberation time before surgeons abandon a 
failing BBTAVF compared to an AVG. Both functional primary and secondary patency 
rates were significantly higher in the BBTAVF group at 1-year follow-up: 73.2% 
versus 34.1% (p < 0.001) and 71.8% versus 54.3% (p = 0.022), respectively. AVGs 
also required more interventions to maintain patency. When maturation rates were 
considered, the overall patency of AVGs was initially superior in the first 25 
weeks after creation and then became inferior afterwards. Conclusion. BBTAVFs 
had superior primary and functional patency and required less salvage 
interventions. The forearm AVG might have a role in patients who require early 
vascular access due to complications from central venous catheters or with 
limited life expectancy.

This is the official guideline endorsed by the specialty associations involved 
in the care of head and neck cancer patients in the UK. This paper provides 
recommendations on the pre-treatment clinical assessment of patients presenting 
with head and neck cancer. Recommendations • Comorbidity data should be 
collected as it is important in the analysis of survival, quality of life and 
functional outcomes after treatment as well as for comparing results of 
different treatment regimens and different centres. (R) • Patients with 
hypertension of over 180/110 or associated target organ damage, should have 
antihypertensive medication started pre-operatively as per British Hypertension 
Society guidelines. (R) • Rapidly correcting pre-operative hypertension with 
beta blockade appears to cause higher mortality due to stroke and hypotension 
and should not be used. (R) • Patients with poorly controlled or unstable 
ischaemic heart disease should be referred for cardiology assessment 
pre-operatively. (G) • Patients within one year of drug eluting stents should be 
discussed with the cardiologist who was responsible for their percutaneous 
coronary intervention pre-operatively with regard to cessation of antiplatelet 
medication due to risk of stent thrombosis. (G) • Patients with multiple recent 
stents should be managed in a centre with access to interventional cardiology. 
(G) • Surgery after myocardial infarction should be delayed if possible to 
reduce mortality risk. (R) • Patients with critical aortic stenosis (AS) should 
be considered for pre-operative intervention. (G) • Clopidogrel should be 
discontinued 7 days pre-operatively; warfarin should be discontinued 5 days 
pre-operatively. (R) • Patients with thromboembolic disease or artificial heart 
valves require heparin therapy to bridge peri-operative warfarin cessation, this 
should start 2 days after last warfarin dose. (R) • Cardiac drugs other than 
angotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists should be 
continued including on the day of surgery. (R) • Angotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists should be withheld on the day of 
surgery unless they are for the treatment of heart failure. (R) • Post-operative 
care in a critical care area should be considered for patients with heart 
failure or significant diastolic dysfunction. (R) • Patients with respiratory 
disease should have their peri-operative respiratory failure risk assessed and 
critical care booked accordingly. (G) • Patients with severe lung disease should 
be assessed for right heart disease pre-operatively. (G) • Patients with 
pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure will be at extraordinarily high 
risk and should have the need for surgery re-evaluated. (G) • Perioperative 
glucose readings should be kept within 4-12 mmol/l. (R) • Patients with a high 
HbA1C facing urgent surgery should have their diabetes management assessed by a 
diabetes specialist. (G) • Insulin-dependent diabetic patients must not omit 
insulin for more than one missed meal and will therefore require an insulin 
replacement regime. (R) • Patients taking more than 5 mg of prednisolone daily 
should have steroid replacement in the peri-operative period. (R) • Consider 
proton pump therapy for patients taking steroids in the peri-operative phase if 
they fit higher risk criteria. (R) • Surgery within three months of stroke 
carries high risk of further stroke and should be delayed if possible. (R) • 
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis should have flexion/extension views assessed 
by a senior radiologist pre-operatively. (R) • Patients at risk of 
post-operative cognitive dysfunction and delirium should be highlighted at 
pre-operative assessment. (G) • Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) must have 
enteral access so drugs can be given intra-operatively. Liaison with a 
specialist in PD is essential. (R) • Intravenous iron should be considered for 
anaemia in the urgent head and neck cancer patient. (G) • Preoperative blood 
transfusion should be avoided where possible. (R) • Where pre-operative 
transfusion is essential it should be completed 24-48 hours pre-operatively. (R) 
• An accurate alcohol intake assessment should be completed for all patients. 
(G) • Patients considered to have a high level of alcohol dependency should be 
considered for active in-patient withdrawal at least 48 hours pre-operatively in 
liaison with relevant specialists. (R) • Parenteral B vitamins should be given 
routinely on admission to alcohol-dependent patients. (R) • Smoking cessation, 
commenced preferably six weeks before surgery, decreases the incidence of 
post-operative complications. (R) • Antibiotics are necessary for 
clean-contaminated head and neck surgery, but unnecessary for clean surgery. (R) 
• Antibiotics should be administered up to 60 minutes before skin incision, as 
close to the time of incision as possible. (R) • Antibiotic regimes longer than 
24 hours have no additional benefit in clean-contaminated head and neck surgery. 
(R) • Repeat intra-operative antibiotic dosing should be considered for longer 
surgeries or where there is major blood loss. (R) • Local antibiotic policies 
should be developed and adhered to due to local resistance patterns. (G) • 
Individual assessment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk and bleeding risk 
should occur on admission and be reassessed throughout the patients' stay. (G) • 
Mechanical prophylaxis for VTE is recommended for all patients with one or more 
risk factors for VTE. (R) • Patients with additional risk factors of VTE and low 
bleeding risk should have low molecular weight heparin at prophylactic dose or 
unfractionated heparin if they have severe renal impairment. (R).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of second-line nilotinib vs 
dasatinib among patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid 
leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) who are resistant or intolerant to 
imatinib, from a US third-party perspective.
METHODS: A lifetime partitioned survival model was developed to compare the 
costs and effectiveness of nilotinib vs dasatinib, which included four health 
states: CP on treatment, CP post-discontinuation, progressive disease 
(accelerated phase [AP] or blast crisis [BC]), and death. Time on treatment, 
progression-free survival, and overall survival of nilotinib and dasatinib were 
estimated using real-world comparative effectiveness data. Parametric survival 
models were used to extrapolate outcomes beyond the study period. Drug treatment 
costs, medical costs, and adverse event costs were obtained from the literature 
and publicly available databases. Utilities of health states were derived from 
the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, including incremental 
cost per life-year (LY) gained and incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained, were estimated comparing nilotinib and dasatinib. 
Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed by varying patient 
characteristics, cost, and utility inputs.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, nilotinib-treated patients were associated 
with 11.7 LYs, 9.1 QALYs, and a total cost of $1,409,466, while 
dasatinib-treated patients were associated with 9.5 LYs, 7.3 QALYs, and a total 
cost of $1,422,122. In comparison with dasatinib, nilotinib was associated with 
better health outcomes (by 2.2 LYs and 1.9 QALYs) and lower total costs (by 
$12,655). Deterministic sensitivity analysis results showed consistent findings 
in most scenarios.
LIMITATIONS: In the absence of long-term real-world data, the lifetime 
projection could not be validated.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with dasatinib, second-line nilotinib was associated with 
better life expectancy, better quality-of-life, and lower costs among patients 
with Ph+ CML-CP who were resistant or intolerant to imatinib.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of a heart failure management intervention 
can be further informed by incorporating the expected benefits and costs of 
future survival.
METHODS: This study compared the long-term costs per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained from home-based (HBI) vs specialist clinic-based intervention 
(CBI) among elderly patients (mean age = 71 years) with heart failure discharged 
home (mean intervention duration = 12 months). Cost-utility analysis was 
conducted from a government-funded health system perspective. A Markov cohort 
model was used to simulate disease progression over 15 years based on initial 
data from a randomized clinical trial (the WHICH? study). Time-dependent hazard 
functions were modeled using the Weibull function, and this was compared against 
an alternative model where the hazard was assumed to be constant over time. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify 
the key drivers of cost-effectiveness and quantify uncertainty in the results.
RESULTS: During the trial, mortality was the highest within 30 days of discharge 
and decreased thereafter in both groups, although the declining rate of 
mortality was slower in CBI than HBI. At 15 years (extrapolated), HBI was 
associated with slightly better health outcomes (mean of 0.59 QALYs gained) and 
mean additional costs of AU$13,876 per patient. The incremental cost-utility 
ratio and the incremental net monetary benefit (vs CBI) were AU$23,352 per QALY 
gained and AU$15,835, respectively. The uncertainty was driven by variability in 
the costs and probabilities of readmissions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
showed HBI had a 68% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of AU$50,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Compared with CBI (outpatient specialized HF clinic-based 
intervention), HBI (home-based predominantly, but not exclusively) could 
potentially be cost-effective over the long-term in elderly patients with heart 
failure at a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$50,000/QALY, albeit with large 
uncertainty.

and Infectious Diseases, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical 
Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Progression of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) is 
punctuated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and recurrent pulmonary 
exacerbations, and is the major determinant of a patient's life expectancy. With 
the advent of novel deep-sequencing techniques, polymicrobial bacterial 
assemblages rather than single pathogens seem to be responsible for the 
deterioration of pulmonary function. This review summarizes recent insights into 
the development of the CF respiratory tract microbiome, with its determinants 
and its relations to clinical parameters.
RECENT FINDINGS: Research has moved from microbiota snapshots to intensive 
sampling over time, in an attempt to identify biomarkers of progression of CF 
lung disease. The developing respiratory tract microbiota in CF is perturbed by 
various endogenous and exogenous factors from the first months of life on. This 
work has revealed that both major pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and newly 
discovered players such as anaerobic species seem to contribute to CF lung 
disease. However, their interrelations remain to be unraveled.
SUMMARY: Long-term follow-up of microbiome development and alterations in 
relation to progression of lung disease and treatment is recommended. Moreover, 
integrating this information with other systems such as the metabolome, genome, 
mycome and virome is likely to contribute significantly to insights into 
host-microbiome interactions and thereby CF lung disease pathogenesis.

Orthopaedic Surgery, Kitasato University Kitasato Institute Hospital, Tokyo, 
Japan.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the invasiveness, efficacy, and 
safety of minimally invasive spine stabilization (MISt) for metastatic spinal 
tumor patients with short life expectancy.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Conventional open surgery for metastatic spinal 
tumors has the disadvantages of significant blood loss, potential infection, 
damage to back muscles, and extended hospital stays. The minimally invasive 
spine surgery has changed the treatment of metastatic spinal tumors radically 
and fundamentally.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 50 consecutive 
patients registered with the Keio Spine Research Group (KSRG) who underwent 
posterior palliative surgery for metastatic spinal tumors from January 2009 to 
June 2015. Of these, 25 patients underwent MISt surgery (M group), and 25 
underwent conventional open surgery (C group). The patients were assessed by 
demographic data, surgical invasiveness, complications, pain improvement, and 
neurological recovery.
RESULTS: The 2 groups did not differ significantly in baseline characteristics. 
The M group had significantly less blood loss (M, 340.1 mL; C, 714.3 mL; 
P=0.005), less postoperative drainage (M, 136.0 mL; C, 627.0 mL; P<0.001), lower 
rates of red blood cell transfusion (M, 3 cases; C, 10 cases; P=0.029), and a 
shorter postoperative period of bed rest (M, 2.0 d; C, 3.6 d; P<0.001), compared 
with the C group. The perioperative complication rates were significantly lower 
(P=0.012) in the M group (3 patients, 12%) than in the C group (11 patients, 
44%). Neurological deficits and pain improved significantly and comparably in 
the 2 groups after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: MISt is a less invasive and effective alternative surgery to 
conventional open surgery for metastatic spinal tumors. MISt should be 
considered as a valid option for the treatment of metastatic spinal tumor 
patients with a short life expectancy.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.
