shorter hospitalization time.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the NS approach for lobectomy is a safe and effective 
method for reducing postoperative symptoms and increasing QOL in patients with 
unilateral PTMC in both 3 and 12 months' follow-up.

The transformation from disorder to order in self-assembly is an autonomous 
entropy-decreasing process. The spatial organization of nanoscale anisotropic 
building blocks involves the intrinsic heterogeneity in three dimensions and 
requires sufficiently precise control to coordinate intricate interactions. Only 
a few approaches have been shown to achieve the anisotropic extension from 
components to assemblies. Here, we demonstrate the ability to engineer 
three-dimensional low-entropy lattices at the nucleotide level from modular DNA 
origami frames. Through the programmable DNA bridging strategy, DNA domains of 
the same composition are periodically arranged in the crystal growth directions. 
We combine the site-specific positioning of guest nanoparticles to reflect the 
anisotropy control, which is validated by small-angle X-ray scattering and 
electron microscopy. We expect that our DNA origami-mediated crystallization 
method will facilitate both the exploration of refined self-assembly platforms 
and the creation of anisotropic metamaterials.

Fractures are associated with increased long-term mortality in patients 
surviving to undergo baseline DXA. Notably, excess mortality risk does not 
decline with increasing time since prior hip or humerus fractures, even after 
accounting for comorbid medical conditions and other risk factors.
INTRODUCTION: Mortality risk increases following most types of fracture. In 
routine clinical practice, patients with prior fractures seen for dual-energy 
X-ray absorptiometry scan (DXA) are "survivors;" whether they remain at 
increased mortality risk is unknown. We tested the association between prior 
fracture and all-cause mortality, stratified by time since fracture, in patients 
undergoing baseline DXA.
METHODS: We conducted a DXA registry-based cohort study and linked to 
population-based health services data for the Province of Manitoba, Canada. We 
identified women and men ≥ 40 years with minimum 10 years of prior healthcare 
coverage undergoing baseline DXA and ascertained prior fracture codes since 1984 
and mortality to 2017. Time since prior fracture was calculated between the 
clinical encounter for the fracture and baseline DXA (index date). Cox 
proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in 
those with compared to those without prior fracture adjusted for (1) age and 
sex, and (2) age, sex, comorbidities, and other covariates.
RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 74,474 individuals (mean age 64.6 years, 
89.7% female). During mean follow-up 9.2 years, we ascertained 14,923 (20.0%) 
deaths. Except for forearm fractures, all fracture sites were associated with 
increased mortality risk compared to those without prior fracture, even after 
multivariable adjustment. Excess mortality risk tended to decline slightly with 
time since fracture and was no longer significant > 10 years after vertebral 
fracture. However, excess mortality persisted > 10 years following hip or 
humerus fracture.
CONCLUSIONS: Prior fractures are associated with increased long-term mortality 
in patients surviving to undergo baseline DXA. Excess mortality risk does not 
decline with time since prior hip or humerus fractures, after accounting for 
potential confounders. Fracture prevention may have important long-term benefits 
preserving life expectancy.

With the advent of COVID-19 vaccines, countries around the globe are 
anticipating a way out from the pandemic. Despite being an initiative to contain 
the COVID-19 virus spreading, the mass vaccination program also raised concerns 
about its consequences on the lifestyle, attitude, and behavioral pattern of 
vaccinated people in the post-vaccination period. With this in mind, this study 
investigated changes in lifestyle, attitude, and behavior among vaccinated 
people in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional survey was conducted incorporating 1227 
COVID-19 vaccinated respondents from eight divisions of Bangladesh. The relative 
importance index (RII) was used to assess the most compelling lifestyle, 
attitude, and behavior changes, while binary logistic regression was used to 
identify factors driving the changes. Findings disclosed that respondents 
increased the physical contact with non-vaccinated ones and amplified consuming 
nutritious food after vaccination. The inclination of avoiding distance, 
handshaking, abandoning sanitizer and mask, visiting crowded places, traveling, 
and staying outside longer was found to be increased among vaccinated 
individuals. Surprisingly, about seven out of ten surveyed respondents exhibited 
a sedentary lifestyle, while 67.37% of respondents showed negative behavioral 
changes following the vaccination period. A positive attitude was observed in 
encouraging others to be vaccinated against COVID-19. However, 92% of the 
respondents positively changed their attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine after 
vaccination. Furthermore, the participants' age, residence, economic status, and 
educational level influenced lifestyle, attitude, and behavioral changes 
positively. The study recommends informing citizens about the opacity of 
vaccinations' ability to contain infections and encouraging them to continue 
following COVID-19 protective guidelines.

In the beginning of the COVID-19 US epidemic in March 2020, sweeping lockdowns 
and other aggressive measures were put in place and retained in many states 
until end of August of 2020; the ensuing economic downturn has led many to 
question the wisdom of the early COVID-19 policy measures in the US. This 
study's objective was to evaluate the cost and benefit of the US 
COVID-19-mitigating policy intervention during the first six month of the 
pandemic in terms of COVID-19 mortality potentially averted, versus mortality 
potentially attributable to the economic downturn. We conducted a 
synthesis-based retrospective cost-benefit analysis of the full complex of US 
federal, state, and local COVID-19-mitigating measures, including lockdowns and 
all other COVID-19-mitigating measures, against the counterfactual scenario 
involving no public health intervention. We derived parameter estimates from a 
rapid review and synthesis of recent epidemiologic studies and economic 
literature on regulation-attributable mortality. According to our estimates, the 
policy intervention saved 866,350-1,711,150 lives (4,886,214-9,650,886 
quality-adjusted life-years), while mortality attributable to the economic 
downturn was 57,922-245,055 lives (2,093,811-8,858,444 life-years). We conclude 
that the number of lives saved by the spring-summer lockdowns and other 
COVID-19-mitigation was greater than the number of lives potentially lost due to 
the economic downturn. However, the net impact on quality-adjusted life 
expectancy is ambiguous.

BACKGROUND: Better understanding of the determinants of national life expectancy 
is crucial for economic development, as a healthy nation is a prerequisite for a 
wealthy nation. Many socioeconomic, nutritional, lifestyle, genetic and 
environmental factors can influence a nation's health and longevity. 
Environmental degradation is one of the critical determinants of life 
expectancy, which is still under-researched, as the literature suggests.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the determinants of life expectancy 
in 31 world's most polluted countries with particular attention on environmental 
degradation using the World Bank annual data and British Petroleum data over the 
period of 18 years (2000-2017).
METHODS: The empirical investigation is based on the model of Preston Curve, 
where panel corrected standard errors (PCSE) and feasible general least square 
(FGLS) estimates are employed to explore the long-run effects. Pairwise Granger 
causality test is also used to have short-run causality among the variables of 
interest, taking into account the cross-sectional dependence test and other 
essential diagnostic tests.
RESULTS: The results confirm the existence of the Preston Curve, implying the 
positive effect of economic growth on life expectancy. Environmental degradation 
is found as a threat while health expenditure, clean water and improved 
sanitation affect the life expectancy positively in the sample countries. The 
causality test results reveal one-way causality from carbon emissions to life 
expectancy and bidirectional causalities between drinking water and life 
expectancy and sanitation and life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that environmental degradation is a threat to 
having improved life expectancy in our sample countries. Based on the results of 
this study, we recommend that: (1) policy marker of these countries should adopt 
policies that will reduce carbon emissions and thus will improve public health 
and productivity; (2) environment-friendly technologies and resources, such as 
renewable energy, should be used in the production process; (3) healthcare 
expenditure on a national budget should be increased; and (4) clean drinking 
water and basic sanitation facilities must be ensured for all people.

The development of metabolic derangements as a result of HIV treatment has been 
an important area of research since the introduction of zidovudine in the 
1980's. Antiretroviral therapy has intensely evolved in the last three decades, 
with new drugs gradually incorporated into everyday clinical practice. With the 
life expectancy of people living with HIV rapidly approaching that of their 
HIV-negative counterparts, the influence of these antiretrovirals on the 
development of the components of the metabolic syndrome remains of major 
interest to clinicians and their patients. In this review, we aimed to discuss 
the impact of cART on components of the metabolic syndrome, i.e., weight, plasma 
lipid levels, plasma glucose levels, and blood pressure, describing the 
influence of cART classes and of individual antiretrovirals. We also aimed to 
outline the limitations of the research conducted to date and the remaining 
knowledge gaps in this area.

HIV infection requires lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) to control disease 
progression. Although ART has greatly extended the life expectancy of persons 
living with HIV (PWH), PWH nonetheless suffer from an increase in AIDS-related 
and non-AIDS related comorbidities resulting from HIV pathogenesis. Thus, an HIV 
cure is imperative to improve the quality of life of PWH. In this review, we 
discuss the origins of various SIV strains utilized in cure and comorbidity 
research as well as their respective animal species used. We briefly detail the 
life cycle of HIV and describe the pathogenesis of HIV/SIV and the integral role 
of chronic immune activation and inflammation on disease progression and 
comorbidities, with comparisons between pathogenic infections and nonpathogenic 
infections that occur in natural hosts of SIVs. We further discuss the various 
HIV cure strategies being explored with an emphasis on immunological therapies 
and "shock and kill".

BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is associated with health benefits to mothers and 
babies and cost-savings to the health service. Breastfeeding rates in the UK are 
low for various reasons including cultural barriers, inadequate support to 
initiate and sustain breastfeeding, lack of information, or choice not to 
breastfeed. Education and support interventions have been developed aiming at 
promoting breastfeeding rates. The objective of this study was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of such interventions for women, initiated antenatally or in 
the first 8 weeks postnatally, aiming at improving breastfeeding rates, in the 
UK.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of a breastfeeding intervention from the 
perspective of health and personal social services in England. Data on 
intervention effectiveness and the benefits of breastfeeding were derived from 
systematic reviews. Other model input parameters were obtained from published 
sources, supplemented by expert opinion.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the modelled 
intervention added on standard care versus standard care was £51,946/QALY, 
suggesting that the intervention is not cost-effective under National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria in England. Sensitivity analysis 
suggested that the cost-effectiveness of the intervention improved as its 
effectiveness increased and intervention cost decreased. At the base-case effect 
(increase in breastfeeding rates 16-26 weeks after birth by 19%), the 
intervention was cost-effective (<£20,000/QALY) if its cost per woman receiving 
the intervention became ≈£40-£45. At the base-case cost (£84), the intervention 
was cost-effective if it increased breastfeeding rates by at least 35-40%.
CONCLUSIONS: Available breastfeeding interventions do not appear to be 
cost-effective under NICE criteria in England. Future breastfeeding 
interventions need to have higher effectiveness or lower cost compared with 
currently available interventions in order to become cost-effective. Public 
health and other societal interventions that protect, promote and support 
breastfeeding may be key in improving breastfeeding rates in the UK.

ALS is a fatal untreatable disease involving degeneration of motor neurons. 
Μultiple causative genes encoding proteins with versatile functions have been 
identified indicating that diverse biological pathways lead to ALS. Chemical 
entities still represent a promising choice to delay ALS progression, attenuate 
symptoms and/or increase life expectancy, but also gene-based and stem 
cell-based therapies are in the process of development, and some are tested in 
clinical trials. Various compounds proved effective in transgenic models 
overexpressing distinct ALS causative genes unfortunately though, they showed no 
efficacy in clinical trials. Notably, while animal models provide a uniform 
genetic background for preclinical testing, ALS patients are not stratified, and 
the distinct genetic forms of ALS are treated as one group, which could explain 
the observed discrepancies between treating genetically homogeneous mice and 
quite heterogeneous patient cohorts. We suggest that chemical entity-genotype 
correlation should be exploited to guide patient stratification for 
pharmacotherapy, that is administered drugs should be selected based on the ALS 
genetic background.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare genetic disorder in which patients 
progressive muscle deterioration and low life expectancy. Since DMD has no cure, 
treatment slows the deterioration process using corticosteroids and other 
medications, including oral bisphosphonates (BP). These drugs can lead to 
toxicities in both soft and hard tissues. The objective of this study was to 
present cytological changes in DMD patients, comparing to young, healthy 
individuals. Cytological smears were obtained from buccal mucosa from nine DMD 
patients and five healthy patients. The Papanicolaou technique was used to stain 
the slides. Images were captured using a photomicroscope, and 50 clearly defined 
cells were selected. The size and ratio between the nucleus and cytoplasmic 
areas (NA/CA) diameter were measured using a computer program. All the DMD 
patients presented a statistical difference (p < 0.0001) in the size of the 
cytoplasm (0.60 ± 0.33 μm) and the NA/CA ratio (0.17 ± 0.07 μm) was seen when 
compared to the control group (cytoplasm 0.60 ± 0.15 µm and nucleus 
0.14 ± 0.05 µm). Furthermore, in one DMD in use of BP who presented 
Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ), presented higher 
differences in the cytoplasmic (1.20 ± 0.65 µm) and nuclear (0.20 ± 0.12 µm) 
sizes (p < 0.0001) compared with all others DMD patients. These results suggest 
that the drugs used or the systemic condition of individuals with DMD may 
contribute to these changes.

BACKGROUND: Internet addiction (IA) and depression are common among adolescents 
and often are co-occurring. This study examined the network structures of IA and 
depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) in adolescents.
METHODS: A total of 1,009 adolescents were recruited. IA and depression were 
measured using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the 9 items-Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. A network analysis was conducted to 
identify central symptoms and bridge symptoms using centrality indices. Network 
stability was evaluated using the case-dropping procedure. The Network 
Comparison Test (NCT) was conducted to examine whether network characteristics 
differed by gender.
RESULTS: Network analysis revealed that nodes IAT-15 ("Preoccupation with the 
Internet"), IAT-2 ("Neglect chores to spend more time online"), PHQ-6 
("Guilty"), and IAT-16 ("Request an extension for longer time spent online") 
were the most central symptoms within the model of coexisting IA and depression. 
The most important bridge symptom was node IAT-11 ("Anticipation for future 
online activities"), followed by IAT-12 ("Fear that life is boring and empty 
without the Internet") and IAT-19 ("Spend more time online over going out with 
others"). Gender did not significantly influence the network structure. The IA 
and depression network model showed a high degree of stability.
CONCLUSION: The central symptoms along with key bridge symptoms identified could 
be potentially targeted when treating and preventing IA and depression among 
adolescents.

Aging is a process involving physiological changes that lead to the decline of 
biological functions of various tissues and organs of the body. Therefore, it is 
crucial to find anti-aging drugs that can intervene with the changes induced 
because of aging and slow down the degeneration of the biological functions. 
Among many signaling pathways linked with aging and aging-related diseases, 
PI3K-AKT signaling pathway has attracted major attention in aging biology. In 
this research paper, we have demonstrated that AKT inhibitor GSK690693 can 
extend lifespan in Drosophila irrespective of start of the treatment from the 
beginning of life or the mid-life. Effect of GSK690693 for lifespan extension 
has been primarily related to the improvements in oxidative resistance, 
intestinal integrity and increased autophagy, but not in physical activity or 
starvation resistance. Furthermore, GSK690693 treatment reduced the activation 
of AKT and ERK, consequently activating FOXO, GSK-3β and apoptosis to modulate 
longevity of flies. Remarkably, GSK690693 did not induce hyperglycemia after 
treatment. The results indicate that GSK690693 may become an effective compound 
for anti-aging intervention.

Tauopathies are a family of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the 
presence of abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Several studies have 
proposed that increased extracellular Tau (eTau) leads to the spread of cerebral 
tauopathy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying eTau-induced 
neurotoxicity remain unclear. Previous in vitro studies reported that the 
ecto-enzyme tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) dephosphorylate eTau 
at different sites increasing its neurotoxicity. Here, we confirm TNAP protein 
upregulation in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and found a similar TNAP 
increase in Pick's disease patients and P301S mice, a well-characterized mouse 
model of tauopathies. Interestingly, the conditional overexpression of TNAP 
causes intracellular Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in cells 
neighbouring those overexpressing the ectoenzyme. Conversely, the genetic 
disruption of TNAP reduced the dephosphorylation of eTau and decreased neuronal 
hyperactivity, brain atrophy, and hippocampal neuronal death in P301S mice. TNAP 
haploinsufficiency in P301S mice prevents the decreased anxiety-like behaviour, 
motor deficiency, and increased memory capacity and life expectancy. Similar 
results were observed by the in vivo pharmacological blunting of TNAP activity. 
This study provides the first in vivo evidence demonstrating that raised TNAP 
activity is critical for Tau-induced neurotoxicity and suggest that TNAP 
blockade may be a novel and efficient therapy to treat tauopathies.

As human life expectancy increases, age-related health issues including 
neurodegenerative diseases continue to rise. Regardless of genetic or 
environmental factors, many neurodegenerative conditions share common 
pathological mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, a hallmark of many 
age-related health burdens. In this review, we describe oxidative damage and 
mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucoma, an age-related neurodegenerative eye 
disease affecting 80 million people worldwide. We consider therapeutic 
approaches used to counteract oxidative stress in glaucoma, including untapped 
treatment options such as novel plant-derived antioxidant compounds that can 
reduce oxidative stress and prevent neuronal loss. We summarize the current 
pre-clinical models and clinical work exploring the therapeutic potential of a 
range of candidate plant-derived antioxidant compounds. Finally, we explore 
advances in drug delivery systems, particular those employing 
nanotechnology-based carriers which hold significant promise as a carrier for 
antioxidants to treat age-related disease, thus reviewing the key current state 
of all of the aspects required towards translation.

Severe Mental Illnesses, including bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia 
(SCZ), are burdened with an increased mortality and a significantly reduced life 
expectancy than general population, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are 
considered the most contributing conditions. The aim of the present study is to 
evaluate 10-year CV risk and the associated clinical characteristics in patients 
with SCZ, BD type I and II. Patients were consecutively recruited from two 
Italian psychiatric acute units. Single CV risk factors were assessed, and 
10-year CV risk calculated by means of the CUORE Project 10-year CV risk 
algorithm, based on the combination of the following risk factors: age, systolic 
blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, 
smoking habit, and hypertensive treatment. Three hundred patients were included. 
Patients with BD type I showed a higher prevalence of hypertension and 10-year 
CV risk score compared to the other groups. In subjects with BD type I, we found 
a significant correlation between duration of illness and number of mood 
episodes and both hypertension and 10-year CV risk score. Several preventive 
strategies should be provided to these vulnerable populations, such as 
correcting unhealthy lifestyles, prescribing medications at lower CV and 
metabolic risk, enhancing access to care.

Radiotherapy and high bilirubin may be metformin like effect on lung cancer via 
possible AMPK pathway modulation.

Atasoy O, Cini N, Erdogan MA, Yaprak G, Erbas O.

PURPOSE: Life expectancy of cancer patients determine the regimen of treatment. 
There is no feasible marker that determines the survival other than the stage of 
the disease or other patients related factors. Bilirubin can be a revealing 
marker for these. The effect of bilirubin may be due to the fact that the 
genetic and biochemical processes of bilirubin also modulate the tumour 
microenvironment. Radiotherapy and bilirubin can produce an effect similar to 
metformin via AMPK pathway.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis was performed retrospectively in a cohort 
of 80 patients with a diagnosis of locoregional lung cancer with bilirubin 
levels in the accepted range. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 
analysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off points. Pre-treatment 
serum total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL) 
levels and tumour volumes in the prognosis of the patients were investigated.
RESULTS: The cut-off points for serum TBIL, DBIL and IBIL were 0.565 mg/dL, 
0.105 mg/dL and 0.415 mg/dL,respectively. High TBIL 47.5 %, high DBIL and high 
IBIL were observed in 45 % of the entire patient population. The overall 
survival was three times longer in the high TBIL group than in the low TBIL 
group (OS; Hazard Ratio (HR), 0.33; 95% CI 0.16-0.70; p <0.001), locoregional 
free survival (LRFS; HR, 0.44; 95% CI 0.27-0.71; p <0.001) and distant 
metastasis-free survival (DMFS; HR, 0.44; 95% 0.25-0.80; p < 0.001). Similarly, 
high DBIL and high IBIL levels have been associated with longer OS, LRFS, and 
DMFS with significant differences. In addition, in the survival analysis of the 
cohort stratified with gross tumour volume (GTV) 128.5cc and TBIL 0.565 cut-off 
values; In the comparison of high TBIL and low TBIL groups, a significantly 
longer OS was observed in the high TBIL group in the patients with a GTV volume 
greater than128.5cc (p <0.001).
CONCLUSION: Plasma bilirubin level at the time of diagnosis affects the survival 
of the patients independent of cancer stage and tumour volume. Possible additive 
interactions of radiotherapy and bilirubin are discussed with their 
pathophysiological mechanisms (Tab. 2, Fig. 7, Ref. 26).

The aim of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of home-based versus 
centre-based rehabilitation in stroke patients across Europe. A state-transition 
cohort model was developed to simulate the impact of the intervention in 32 
European countries. A cost-utility analysis was conducted from a societal 
perspective including healthcare, social care and informal care costs, and 
productivity losses. Health outcomes were expressed as QALYs. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted concerning model input values and structural 
assumptions. Data were obtained from a population-based cohort and previously 
published studies. Across Europe, over 855,000 patients with stroke would be 
eligible for rehabilitation in 2017. Europe-wide implementation of home-based 
rehabilitation was estimated to produce 61,888 additional QALYs (95% CI: 3,609 
to 118,679) and cost savings of €237 million (95% CI: -237 to 1,764) and of €352 
million (95% CI: -340 to 2,237) in health- and social-care and societal costs, 
respectively. Under base case assumptions, home-based rehabilitation was found 
highly likely to be cost-effective (>90%), compared to centre-based 
rehabilitation, in most European countries (29 out of 32). Evidence from this 
study suggests that a shift from a centre-based to a home-based approach to 
stroke rehabilitation is likely to be good value for money in most European 
countries. Further research should be conducted to assess the generalisability 
of these findings to local settings.

PURPOSE: We aimed to estimate the burden of UTIs by age, sex, and socioeconomic 
status in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We used data from Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study (GBD) 2019 to analyse the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) due to UTIs at the global, regional, and national levels. 
Estimates are presented as numbers and age-standardised or age-specific rates 
per 100,000 population, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We further 
explored the associations between the incidence, mortality, DALYs, and 
socio-demographic index (SDI) as a proxy for the development status of regions 
and countries.
RESULTS: In 2019, more than 404.6 million (95% UI 359.4-446.5) individuals had 
UTIs globally and nearly 236,786 people (198,433-259,034) died of UTIs, 
contributing to 5.2 million (4.5-5.7) DALYs. The age-standardised incidence rate 
increased from 4715.0 (4174.2-5220.6) per 100,000 population in 1990 to 5229.3 
(4645.3-5771.2) per 100,000 population in 2019. At the GBD regional level, the 
highest age-standardised incidence rate in 2019 occurred in Tropical Latin 
America (13,852.9 [12,135.6-15,480.3] per 100,000 population). At the national 
level, Ecuador had the highest age-standardised incidence rate (15,511.3 
[13,685.0-17,375.6] per 100,000 population). The age-standardised death rates 
were highest in Barbados (19.5 [13.7-23.5] per 100,000 population). In addition, 
age-standardised incidence, death, and DALY rates generally increased across the 
SDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest a globally rising trend of UTI burden 
between 1990 and 2019.

Biochar remediation efficiency could be enhanced through numerous treatments 
such as acids treatment. Still, there has little work done on H3PO4-treated 
biochar particularly biochar derived from Achnatherum splendens L. feedstock. 
Therefore, the present study has been conducted to further explore the potential 
effect of A. splendens L.-derived biochar treated with H3PO4 on bioavailability 
of Cd and wheat growth in Cd contaminated soil. Phosphoric acid and untreated 
biochar each applied at the rate of 1% and 2% to Cd contaminated/spiked soil in 
pots and having one contaminated/spiked control without biochars amendment. The 
results show that 2% phosphoric acid-treated biochar has the most significant 
increase in plant height, shoot dry weight, and grain yield of wheat as compared 
to contaminated control. As compared to contaminated control, maximum 
improvement in total chlorophyll contents, photosynthetic rate, transpiration 
rate, and stomatal conductance occurred with 2% phosphoric acid-treated biochar. 
The 2% phosphoric acid-treated biochar also declined bioavailable Cd in soil by 
53%, and its accumulation in shoot and grain by 65% and 90%, respectively, 
compared to contaminated control. Overall, phosphoric acid-treated biochar most 
effectively immobilized Cd in soil and reducing its uptake and translocation to 
grains. Therefore, A. splendens L.-derived biochar treated with phosphoric acid 
could be successfully utilized for remediation of contaminated soil.
