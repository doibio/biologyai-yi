sizes to confirm these preliminary results.

Breast cancer ranks highest in incidence and mortality among females and second 
among both genders. Lebanon has the second highest rate of breast cancer 
worldwide for those 35-39 years old and the highest for those 40-49. Mastectomy 
often results in deceased shoulder and arm mobility and decreased quality of 
life. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of an educational 
program of therapeutic exercises on the quality of life and functional ability 
in women after a mastectomy. Sixty women undergoing a mastectomy were randomly 
assigned to either an intervention or control group. The intervention group 
received extensive pre-surgery education as well as training on therapeutic 
exercises. Follow-up phone calls to the intervention group were made to ensure 
that the exercises were being done. Both groups were visited at home at two and 
four weeks to obtain the outcome variables. The Breast Cancer Patient Version 
was used to assess quality of life, and the "Goniometer" was used to assess the 
range of motion of the affected shoulder. At two and four weeks after surgery, 
women in the intervention group had significant improvements in their shoulder 
range of motion: flexion, extension, and abduction were significantly different 
between the control and intervention group at p = 0.04-0.00. For quality of 
life, physical, psychological, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being 
were significantly higher for the intervention group at both two and four weeks 
after surgery, p < 0.001. In a middle-income country, one-to-one education 
provided by a nurse, which included demonstrations, back demonstrations, and 
weekly phone calls had a positive impact on women's shoulder range of motion and 
quality of life. NCT04184102.

Aging leads to a number of disorders caused by cellular senescence, tissue 
damage, and organ dysfunction. It has been reported that anti-inflammatory and 
insulin-sensitizing compounds delay, or reverse, the aging process and prevent 
metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative disease, and muscle atrophy, improving 
healthspan and extending lifespan. Here we investigated the effects of PPARγ 
agonists in preventing aging and increasing longevity, given their known 
properties in lowering inflammation and decreasing glycemia. Our molecular and 
physiological studies show that long-term treatment of mice at 14 months of age 
with low doses of the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone (Rosi) improved glucose 
metabolism and mitochondrial functionality. These effects were associated with 
decreased inflammation and reduced tissue atrophy, improved cognitive function, 
and diminished anxiety- and depression-like conditions, without any adverse 
effects on cardiac and skeletal functionality. Furthermore, Rosi treatment of 
mice started when they were 14 months old was associated with lifespan 
extension. A retrospective analysis of the effects of the PPARγ agonist 
pioglitazone (Pio) on longevity showed decreased mortality in patients receiving 
Pio compared to those receiving a PPARγ-independent insulin secretagogue 
glimepiride. Taken together, these data suggest the possibility of using PPARγ 
agonists to promote healthy aging and extend lifespan.

An adequate response to the challenges people face in the context of continuing 
urbanization, increasing life expectancy and, at the same time, falling birth 
rates, is to maximize the containment of chronic non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs) by high level of healthcare organization and medical services provided to 
the patients with such pathologies. Global economic losses caused by NCDs result 
in disability and early mortality among working population as well as in 
significant treatment costs increasing with the advancement of the disease. That 
is why outpatient care for NCD patients which includes behaviour factors 
monitoring is an urgent task for the world and Russian healthcare. In this 
regard, the goal of this study is to find organizational solutions to improve 
regular medical checkup service for NCD patients in the metropolitan healthcare 
system, relying on the data provided by medical organizations in the form of 
statistical observations. Thus, the results of correlation analysis have 
revealed a connection between the increased number of individuals in the second 
and third health groups and individuals scheduled for a regular medical checkup 
at the end of the year and its absence between the clinical examination results 
and the number of firstly diagnosed patients. It is also reported that the 
number of diseases registered for a regular medical checkup at the end of the 
reporting period (year) has increased, so patients with polymorbid conditions 
are supposed to prevail among the others on these days and require a special 
approach to their management. Taking into account the results obtained, possible 
ways for optimizing the organizational model of a regular medical checkup are 
the following: special hours (days) for such patients admission, permanent 
cooperation of a doctor (local general practitioner, GP, family doctor) and a 
health worker with a secondary medical education (to deal with organizational 
issues), etc.

Programs to increase the life expectancy of old people are becoming increasingly 
relevant in an aging society. Their adequacy depends on the quality of 
accounting death causes. Objective: To evaluate the quality of accounting of 
death causes for population over the working age. For 98 061 deaths of people 
over working age registered in Moscow dead database, the structure of underline 
and multiple causes of death were compared. To determine whether information on 
morbidity of elderly can improve the diagnosis of death causes the structure of 
death causes was compared with officially registered prevalence and detected 
prevalence. The last was calculated on the basis of the household survey of 
health of elderly population in Nizhny Novgorod Region (22 558 people). We find 
fundamental difference between the structure of causes for officially registered 
prevalence, detected prevalence and mortality. In the structure of death causes 
the nervous diseases are in the second place and the proportion of uncertain 
death causes is 6.7%. The difference in the structure of underline and multiple 
causes of death is not so great. For people over working age, the coding errors 
were detected in 9.8% underline death causes. Thus, morbidity statistics cannot 
provide informational support for diagnosing causes of death in full. To improve 
the quality of accounting of death causes, it is advisable to introduce the 
institution of coders and to give them the possibility of verifying death 
diagnoses in medical organizations where the diagnosis has been established.

The number of migrants and travellers has grown in recent decades. This 
phenomenon is also true of people living with HIV, given their much-improved 
life expectancy and quality of life. A significant number of travellers with HIV 
are migrants returning to their home countries to visit friends and relatives 
(VFRs). This population constitutes a high-risk group because they travel for 
longer and often to rural and remote areas and have closer contact with the 
local population. In this review we discuss the sociodemographic characteristics 
of travellers with HIV, the differences between conventional travellers and 
VFRs, and the risks of HIV acquisition and transmission during travel. We also 
present the most relevant travel-associated illnesses and highlight the 
particularities of pre-travel advice given to this population, including 
immunosuppression, responses to vaccines, high incidence of comorbidities, drug 
interactions, legal and language barriers. The need to integrate these factors 
based on far less evidence than that available for the general population makes 
pre-travel advice for travellers with HIV genuinely challenging.

BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with excess mortality, but it is not known 
how treatment-resistance influences life expectancy. We estimated cause-specific 
excess mortality and Life Years Lost (LYL) in patients with treatment-resistant 
depression (TRD).
METHODS: The population included all individuals born and living in Denmark who 
redeemed their first prescription for an antidepressant at age 18-69 years 
between 2005 and 2012, identified in the Danish National Prescription Registry. 
TRD was defined as at least two additional and different antidepressant trials 
within two years. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) were estimated with Cox 
regression adjusted for age at first prescription, calendar year and 
comorbidity. Differences in life expectancy were estimated by the Life Years 
Lost (LYL) method.
RESULTS: The cohort included 154,513 first-time pharmacologically treated 
patients with depression, of whom 8,294 (5.4%) were identified as having TRD. 
Patients were followed for 1,032,245 person-years during which 9,795 deaths 
occurred. Men and women with TRD had significantly higher mortality than non-TRD 
(aMRR: 1.34, 95% CI 1.18-1.52 and aMRR: 1.39, 95% CI 1.19-1.63, respectively). 
Life expectancy for men and women with TRD was 1.21 (95% CI 0.36-2.44) and 1.24 
(95% CI 0.35-2.34) years shorter than in all patients with depression. Suicide 
accounted for the majority of excess LYL, with 1.10 (95% CI 0.46-1.61) years in 
men and 0.82 (95% CI 0.44-1.27) years in women with TRD.
LIMITATIONS: Using redeemed prescriptions to define TRD may increase the risk of 
misclassification.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients not responding adequately to several treatment trials are 
at increased risk for premature death, particularly suicide.

BACKGROUND: Age-related breast cancer treatment variance is widespread with many 
older women having primary endocrine therapy (PET), which may contribute to 
inferior survival and local control. This propensity-matched study determined if 
a subgroup of older women may safely be offered PET.
METHODS: Multicentre, prospective, UK, observational cohort study with 
propensity-matched analysis to determine optimal allocation of surgery plus ET 
(S+ET) or PET in women aged ≥70 with breast cancer. Data on fitness, frailty, 
cancer stage, grade, biotype, treatment and quality of life were collected. 
Propensity-matching (based on age, health status and cancer stage) adjusted for 
allocation bias when comparing S+ET with PET.
FINDINGS: A total of 3416 women (median age 77, range 69-102) were recruited 
from 56 breast units-2854 (88%) had ER+ breast cancer: 2354 had S+ET and 500 
PET. Median follow-up was 52 months. Patients treated with PET were older and 
frailer than patients treated with S+ET. Unmatched overall survival was inferior 
in the PET group (hazard ratio, (HR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.23-0.33, P < 0.001). Unmatched breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was also 
inferior in patients treated with PET (HR: 0.41, CI: 0.29-0.58, P < 0.001 for 
BCSS). In the matched analysis, PET was still associated with an inferior 
overall survival (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53-0.98, P = 0.04) but not BCSS 
(HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.40-1.37, P = 0.34) although at 4-5 years subtle divergence 
of the curves commenced in favor of surgery. Global health status diverged at 
certain time points between groups but over 24 months was similar when adjusted 
for baseline variance.
INTERPRETATION: For the majority of older women with early ER+ breast cancer, 
surgery is oncologically superior to PET. In less fit, older women, with 
characteristics similar to the matched cohort of this study (median age 81 with 
higher comorbidity and functional impairment burdens, the BCSS survival 
differential disappears at least out to 4-5 year follow-up, suggesting that for 
those with less than 5-year predicted life-expectancy (>90 years or >85 with 
comorbidities or frailty) individualised decision making regarding PET versus 
S+ET may be appropriate and safe to offer. The Age Gap online decision tool may 
support this decision-making process (https://agegap.shef.ac.uk/).

INTRODUCTION: Band migration is a late complication of Laparoscopic Adjustable 
Gastric Banding insertion, although rare it could be life threatening presenting 
as peritonitis secondary to gastro-intestinal tract injuries. A case of an 
unexpected extension of severe gastro-intestinal tract injuries secondary to 
intra-gastric migration and distal band dislocation is reported.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 53 years old male, with a history of laparoscopic 
gastric banding 15 years before and known erosion of the band into the gastric 
lumen was admitted for abdominal pain and raised serum amylase. Imaging revealed 
dislocation of the band down to the jejunum. Endoscopy and exploratory surgery 
showed severe decubitus pressure on the gastric antrum up to the duodenum as 
well as on the pancreas due to rod-like effect of the gastric band catheter and 
multiple sites of perforation on distal duodenum and small bowel proximal to the 
band, which migrated within the lumen until 90 cm distal to the Treitz ligament. 
Extended distal gastrectomy and resection of distal duodenum and small bowel 
extended to the proximal affected small bowel were necessary. Digestive tract 
was restored by a gastro-jejunostomy and duodeno-jejunostomy in a Roux-En-Y 
configuration with duodenal stump closure on tube duodenostomy. A post-operative 
leakage from the duodenal stump was treated conservatively and the patient was 
discharged on post-operative day 21.
DISCUSSION: Erosion and migration of the band within the digestive lumen is one 
of the less frequent late complications occurring after LAGB, furthermore, the 
amount of extensive damage reported in this case presentation has yet to be 
reported in literature.
CONCLUSION: Migration of the band should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis of abdominal complain in patients with adjustable gastric banding. 
Such a complication could be severe, and lesions may have unexpected extension 
requiring complex surgical approach.

INTRODUCTION: Central nervous system atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) 
are aggressive lesions usually presenting during the first 3 years of life. 
These tumors have a dismal prognosis with most patients dying within 1 year from 
presentation. Primary spinal location in infants is very rare.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 4-month-old boy who presented with a 
history of hypotonia, poor head control, and gradually reduced level of 
consciousness, over the past week. Computed tomography (CT) showed acute 
hydrocephalus with no underlying intracranial pathology. A ventriculoperitoneal 
shunt was inserted acutely. Postoperatively, ventilator weaning was 
unsuccessful. MRI of the brain and whole spine revealed an intraspinal 
extradural contrast-enhancing heterogenous mass in the subaxial cervical spine 
extending to the thoracic cavity. A biopsy was taken through a transthoracic 
approach, and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of ATRT. Several cycles of 
radiation therapy and chemotherapy were given but the tumor progressed both 
locally and intracranially. Eventually, pupils became dilated and fixed. Brain 
CT scan showed widespread ischemic lesions and an extensive intracranial tumor 
extension with massive bleeding. The child eventually died 110 days after 
admission.
CONCLUSIONS: In infants presenting with acute hydrocephalus where an obvious 
intracranial cause is not detected, the whole neuraxis should be screened. 
However, despite aggressive measures and advances in multimodality treatment, 
prognosis of ATRT remains dismal.

BACKGROUND: Persons with a lower socioeconomic position spend more years with 
disability, despite their shorter life expectancy, but it is unknown what the 
important determinants are. This study aimed to quantify the contribution to 
educational inequalities in years with disability of eight risk factors: 
father's manual occupation, low income, few social contacts, smoking, high 
alcohol consumption, high body-weight, low physical exercise and low fruit and 
vegetable consumption.
METHODS: We collected register-based mortality and survey-based disability and 
risk factor data from 15 European countries covering the period 2010-14 for most 
countries. We calculated years with disability between the ages of 35 and 80 by 
education and gender using the Sullivan method, and determined the hypothetical 
effect of changing the prevalence of each risk factor to the prevalence observed 
among high educated ('upward levelling scenario'), using Population Attributable 
Fractions.
RESULTS: Years with disability among low educated were higher than among high 
educated, with a difference of 4.9 years among men and 5.5 years among women for 
all countries combined. Most risk factors were more prevalent among low 
educated. We found the largest contributions to inequalities in years with 
disability for low income (men: 1.0 year; women: 1.4 year), high body-weight 
(men: 0.6 year; women: 1.2 year) and father's manual occupation (men: 0.7 year; 
women: 0.9 year), but contributions differed by country. The contribution of 
smoking was relatively small.
CONCLUSIONS: Disadvantages in material circumstances (low income), circumstances 
during childhood (father's manual occupation) and high body-weight contribute to 
inequalities in years with disability.

The role of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in COVID-19 
patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) is uncertain, as no 
direct evidence exists to support NIPPV use in such patients. We retrospectively 
assessed the effectiveness and safety of NIPPV in a cohort of COVID-19 patients 
consecutively admitted to the COVID-19 general wards of a medium-size Italian 
hospital, from March 6 to May 7, 2020. Healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for 
COVID-19 patients were monitored, undergoing nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 
in case of onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and periodic SARS-CoV-2 screening 
serology. Overall, 50 patients (mean age 74.6 years) received NIPPV, of which 22 
(44%) were successfully weaned, avoiding endotracheal intubation (ETI) and 
AHRF-related death. Due to limited life expectancy, 25 (50%) of 50 NIPPV-treated 
patients received a "do not intubate" (DNI) order. Among these, only 6 (24%) 
were weaned from NIPPV. Of the remaining 25 NIPPV-treated patients without 
treatment limitations, 16 (64%) were successfully weaned, 9 (36%) underwent 
delayed ETI and, of these, 3 (33.3%) died. NIPPV success was predicted by the 
use of corticosteroids (OR 15.4, CI 1.79-132.57, p 0.013) and the increase in 
the PaO2/FiO2 ratio measured 24-48 h after NIPPV initiation (OR 1.02, CI 1-1.03, 
p 0.015), while it was inversely correlated with the presence of a DNI order (OR 
0.03, CI 0.001-0.57, p 0.020). During the study period, 2 of 124 (1.6%) HCWs 
caring for COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Apart 
from patients with limited life expectancy, NIPPV was effective in a 
substantially high percentage of patients with COVID-19-associated AHRF. The 
risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was low.

Background: The study assessed the cost-utility of selective internal radiation 
therapy (SIRT) with Y-90 resin microspheres versus sorafenib in UK patients with 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ineligible for transarterial 
chemoembolization. Materials & methods: A lifetime partitioned survival model 
was developed for patients with low tumor burden (≤25%) and good liver function 
(albumin-bilirubin grade 1). Efficacy, safety and quality of life data were from 
a European Phase III randomized controlled trial and published studies. Resource 
use was from registries and clinical surveys. Results: Discounted 
quality-adjusted life-years were 1.982 and 1.381, and discounted total costs 
were £29,143 and 30,927, for SIRT and sorafenib, respectively. Conclusion: SIRT 
has the potential to be a dominant (more efficacious/less costly) or 
cost-effective alternative to sorafenib in patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Background Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common forms of valvular 
heart disease. Our aim was to estimate the burden of AS in the hospital in 
France, describe patient characteristics, and evaluate the mortality rate and 
temporal trends. Methods and Results All patients hospitalized for AS in France 
between 2006 and 2016 were identified from the national hospital discharge 
database. Patients' sociodemographic, medical, and surgical characteristics and 
temporal trends were described. All AS-related deaths between 2000 and 2014 were 
identified using death certificates. In 2016, 26 071 patients were hospitalized 
for AS: 56.5% were men with an average age of 77 years. The all-cause mortality 
rate at 1 year postindex stay was 11%. The rate of patients hospitalized for AS 
increased by 59% between 2006 and 2016, reaching 38.7/100 000 person-years in 
2016. This increase was most pronounced in patients aged >75 years. The number 
of transcatheter aortic valve implantations increased following their 
introduction in 2010. In 2016, 44% of patients were treated with aortic valve 
surgery during the index hospital stay or following year (mean age, 71.5 years), 
and 34% were treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (mean age, 
83.0 years). In 2014, 6186 deaths caused by AS were identified in death 
certificates: 41.6% were men with an average age of 87 years. The 
age-standardized mortality rate increased by 5% between 2000 and 2014, reaching 
8.5/100 000 person-years in 2014. Conclusions The rate of patients hospitalized 
for AS increased in recent years in line with the higher life expectancy and 
introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Mortality increased 
more moderately.

Background Life expectancy in the United States has recently declined, in part 
attributable to premature cardiometabolic mortality. We characterized national 
trends in premature cardiometabolic mortality, overall, and by race-sex groups. 
Methods and Results Using death certificates from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research, we 
quantified premature deaths (<65 years of age) from heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus from 1999 to 2018. We calculated 
age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) and years of potential life lost (YPLL) 
from each cardiometabolic cause occurring at <65 years of age. We used Joinpoint 
regression to identify an inflection point in overall cardiometabolic AAMR 
trends. Average annual percent change in AAMRs and YPLL was quantified before 
and after the identified inflection point. From 1999 to 2018, annual premature 
deaths from heart disease (117 880 to 128 832), cerebrovascular disease (18 765 
to 20 565), and diabetes mellitus (16 553 to 24 758) as an underlying cause of 
death increased. By 2018, 19.7% of all heart disease deaths, 13.9% of all 
cerebrovascular disease deaths, and 29.1% of all diabetes mellitus deaths were 
premature. AAMRs and YPLL from heart disease and cerebrovascular disease 
declined until the inflection point identified in 2011, then remained unchanged 
through 2018. Conversely, AAMRs and YPLL from diabetes mellitus did not change 
through 2011, then increased through 2018. Black men and women had higher AAMRs 
and greater YPLL for each cardiometabolic cause compared with White men and 
women, respectively. Conclusions Over one-fifth of cardiometabolic deaths 
occurred at <65 years of age. Recent stagnation in cardiometabolic AAMRs and 
YPLL are compounded by persistent racial disparities.

INTRODUCTION: In 2018, we counted 14 291 patients on the French kidney 
transplantation waiting list, and 3546 grafted. The law applies the presumed 
consent and public surveys shows a desire for information. The objective of this 
research was to describe transplanted patients' lives history in order to cope 
with this need for information.
METHODS: Qualitative study, narrative inquiries, of French Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes 
transplanted patients' life story, between December 2016 and February 2019. 
Interviews were fully transcribed and analyzed by two researchers. The sampling 
was defined by gender, age, dialysis time and socio-professional categories. 
Notification to the French data protection authority was carried out.
RESULTS: With the ninth interview, sufficient data was collected. The start of 
the disease could be insidious or brutal. All interviewees changed lifestyle 
habits. Sometimes, the dialysis made the recovery of certain autonomy possible, 
but had nutritional and organizational constraints. Transplantation, without 
complications, reduced significantly the burden of the disease and its 
treatment. The difficult and agonizing expectancy of the transplant was then 
replaced by the patients' feeling of Damocles sword due to the uncertainty 
around the graft's life expectancy. The dialysis burdens were replaced by the 
immunosuppressive side effects. The patients' dependence on the graft resonated 
with a moral duty towards the donor, their relatives and themselves.
CONCLUSION: Renal insufficiency comprises alternations of autonomy and 
dependence.

The management of glioblastoma in the elderly population represents a field of 
growing interest owing a longer life expectancy. In this age group, more than in 
the young adult, biological age is much more important than chronologic one. The 
date of birth should not exclude a priori access of treatments. Maximal safe 
resection is proved to be the first option when performance status and general 
health is good. Adjuvant therapy and decision about management of recurrence 
should be choose in a multidisciplinary group according to performance of the 
patients and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl-transferase methylation.

Ambient air pollution, in the form of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), poses 
serious population health risks. We estimate cross-national longitudinal models 
to test whether the negative relationship between life expectancy and PM2.5 
concentration is larger in nations with higher levels of income inequality. The 
dependent variable is average life expectancy at birth, and the focal predictor 
variables include PM2.5 concentration, income inequality, and the two-way 
interaction between them. We also estimate the average marginal effects of PM2.5 
concentration from low to high values of income inequality, and the predicted 
values of life expectancy from low to high values of PM2.5 concentration and 
income inequality. Results indicate that the negative relationship between life 
expectancy and PM2.5 concentration is larger in nations with higher levels of 
income inequality, and the reductions in predicted life expectancy are 
substantial when both PM2.5 concentration and income inequality are high. We 
suggest that the theoretical principles of Power, Proximity, and Physiology help 
explain our findings. This study underscores the importance in considering the 
multiplicative impacts of environmental conditions and socioeconomic factors in 
the modeling of population health.

Diseases of the lung result in oxygen deficiency, hypoxemia, with the 
indications for oxygen supplementation, whereas hypercapnia and dyspnea are 
consequences of disorders and failure of the ventilatory pump, which need to be 
treated by mechanical ventilation. Early diagnostics enable a timely noninvasive 
ventilation treatment and can prevent overt ventilatory failure and avoid acute 
invasive ventilation. Diagnostic measures are available, so that the risk of 
developing overt respiratory failure can be ascertained in time. Treatment of 
respiratory pump insufficiency, i.e. ventilatory insufficiency, is also 
established. Many patients with ventilatory insufficiency use intermittent or 
continuous ventilation every day in order to relieve the respiratory 
musculature. Many studies have confirmed an extension of life expectancy and 
a better quality of life, when this relief together with a lowering of the pCO2 
is achieved under ventilation and more importantly while breathing 
spontaneously. If the target of lowering the pCO2 is not achieved, an effect of 
intermittent ventilation cannot be detected. The more severe the disease, the 
more difficult it is to achieve relief, because the substantial effort needed
