detection scale to the level of single cell, allowing extension of its 
application for in vivo detection of infected cells and their phenotypic 
analysis. Thus, SFQF assay may serve as an alternative analytical tool for 
ensuring the reliability of LCMV titration and can be used with other types of 
viruses using target-specific antibodies.

IMPORTANCE: Little evidence exists to guide helicopter emergency medical 
services (HEMS) triage, and current practice is inefficient. The Air Medical 
Prehospital Triage (AMPT) score was developed to identify patients most likely 
to benefit from HEMS compared with ground EMS. To our knowledge, no studies have 
evaluated the potential effect on costs and outcomes of a more targeted HEMS 
triage strategy, such as the AMPT score.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of current practice compared with 
the AMPT score for HEMS scene triage of trauma patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cost-effectiveness Markov model was 
developed for the US health care system to compare current practice with the 
AMPT score as HEMS scene triage strategies from the health care system 
perspective over a patient lifetime horizon. A base case was estimated using 
national data of patient characteristics from the National Trauma Databank from 
2007 to 2012. Model inputs, including demographic information, health care 
costs, survival, and utility estimates, were derived from literature and 
national registries. Triage strategies were modeled as probability of HEMS 
transport. Multilevel logistic regression was used to evaluate survival 
probability between HEMS and ground EMS under the triage strategies. Costs 
considered included transport reimbursements, hospitalization, cost of health 
care in the first year postinjury, and annual cost of health care after the 
first year postinjury. Several sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate 
robustness of model assumptions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, with a 
threshold of $100 000 or less per quality-adjusted life-year defining 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The base case had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $255 333 
per quality-adjusted life-year for current practice compared with the AMPT 
score. Assuming 20% of patients have severe injuries and assuming HEMS only 
benefits these patients, current practice had an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $176 686 per quality-adjusted life-year. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated that current practice is inferior in 85% of iterations, 
only becoming favored when the cost-effectiveness threshold is greater than 
$310 000 per quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Current practice is not cost-effective compared with 
the AMPT score for HEMS scene triage. The AMPT score was the preferred strategy 
across a range of model input values in sensitivity analyses. The AMPT score 
identifies patients most likely to benefit from HEMS while potentially reducing 
costs to the health care system and should be considered in air medical 
transport protocols for trauma patients.

This analysis evaluates the cost-effectiveness of current practice compared with 
the Air Medical Prehospital Triage score for helicopter emergency medical 
services scene triage of trauma patients.

QUESTION: Is a selective triage strategy more cost-effective than current 
practices for determining which injured patients should be transported by 
helicopter vs ground ambulance to a trauma center?
FINDINGS: In a nationally representative cohort using cost-effectiveness 
modeling, current helicopter triage practices have an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $255 333 per quality-adjusted life-year compared 
with using the Air Medical Prehospital Triage score, which is significantly more 
than the generally accepted threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
for cost-effective medical interventions.
MEANING: Current helicopter triage practices are not cost-effective compared 
with the Air Medical Prehospital Triage score for determining helicopter vs 
ground transport for trauma patients.

Beneficial effects of working later in life on the health of community-dwelling 
older adults.

Author information:
(1)Nara Prefectural Health Research Center, Nara Medical University, Nara, 
Japan.

AIM: Evidence regarding the health effects of working lack coherence. This study 
seeks to determine if continuing to work into older age benefits or damages 
one's health.
METHODS: Baseline questionnaires were mailed to 15 058 individuals aged ≥65 
years living in two municipalities in Nara Prefecture, Japan. Of these, 11 183 
were returned. Analyses were limited to those who maintained each health index 
at baseline. We followed the participants for 3 years, and examined three health 
outcomes: long-term care need, cognitive decline and instrumental activities of 
daily living (IADL) decline. Participants were divided into four groups 
according to their baseline working status and follow-up status: non-working, 
retired, initiating work and continuing to work.
RESULTS: After covariate adjustments, older men who initiated work had a 
decreased likelihood for long-term care (odds ratio [OR] 0.41, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.17-0.98) and IADL decline (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23-0.84), older men 
who continued working prevented the onset of long-term care (OR 0.22, 95% CI 
0.09-0.54) and cognitive decline (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.96), older women who 
initiated working were less likely to require long-term care (OR 0.24, 95% CI 
0.09-0.66) and IADL decline (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16-0.88), and older women who 
continued working had a significantly lower risk of IADL decline (OR 0.39, 95% 
CI 0.16-0.99), compared with the non-working group. Retirees did not differ from 
the non-working group in any of the health outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Although beneficial effects vary by sex and type of health 
outcomes, the present findings suggest that policies encouraging older people to 
participate in the workforce contribute to extending healthy life expectancy.

Iron deficiency anemia in older adults: A review.

Joosten E(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Geriatric Medicine, University 
Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

Anemia in older adults is a risk factor for numerous negative outcomes. There is 
no standard definition, but in most studies, anemia is defined as a hemoglobin 
value <12 g/dL for women and <13 g/dL for men. Absolute iron deficiency anemia 
is defined as the combination of anemia and the absence of total body iron. 
Serum ferritin is the most frequently used diagnostic parameter, but its 
concentration increases with age and in the presence of inflammatory diseases. 
Other laboratory tests, such as transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin 
receptor and the soluble transferrin receptor/ferritin index might provide 
useful information, but there is a wide variety in the cut-off values and 
interpretation of the results. Recent research regarding hepcidin as a central 
regulator of iron homeostasis is promising, but it has not been used yet for the 
routine diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. In older iron deficiency anemia 
patients, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy should be initiated in 
order to identify the underlying bleeding cause. CT colonography can replace a 
colonoscopy, and in specific cases, a video capsule is recommended. It remains 
crucial to keep in mind which potential benefits might be expected from these 
investigations in this vulnerable population, taking into account the 
comorbidity and life expectancy, and one should discuss in advance the possible 
therapeutic options and complications with the patient, a family member or a 
proxy. Oral iron administration is the standard treatment, but parenteral iron 
is a convenient and safe way to provide the total iron dose in one or a few 
sessions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 373-379.

Care of older people with diabetes.

Dunning T(1).

Author information:

and Barwon Health, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.

The global population is ageing, and increasingly developing long-term 
conditions and comorbidities associated with functional changes, reduced quality 
of life and reduced life expectancy. Diabetes mellitus is a common long-term 
condition in older people, with many individuals experiencing microvascular 
and/or macrovascular complications, alongside frailty and dementia. Symptoms of 
conditions such as hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia may change as a result of 
older age and long duration of, and complications associated with, diabetes; 
therefore, such symptoms can be challenging to recognise in older people. 
Consequently, treatment might be delayed, which can result in further 
deterioration and harm for older people. Managing diabetes is often challenging 
for older people with the condition and their family carers and nurses. One of 
the main challenges for healthcare professionals is deciding safe blood glucose 
and glycated haemoglobin ranges for the individual to avoid over-treatment that 
can lead to hypoglycaemia or under-treatment that can lead to hyperglycaemia and 
associated adverse effects. This article outlines the issues that nurses should 
consider when caring for older people with diabetes, and emphasises the 
importance of personalised care.

[Home parenteral nutrition: a consensus document of experts from Andalucia and

Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is a technique that has allowed the survival in 
the community of those patients with serious diseases resulting in an intestinal 
failure that made their nutrition impossible by other methods. It is indicated 
if there is a documented intestinal failure (understood by the reduction of the 
intestinal function to the minimum to the point that intravenous supplementation 
is required to maintain health and/or growth) with impossibility for oral or 
enteral exclusive nutrition, provided that there is the possibility of managing 
the patient at home and that there is no short-term survival expectancy. It 
requires taking into account the patient's quality of life, family environment 
and the capacity of the patient and/or their caregivers to be trained for HPN 
therapy. In low prevalence health topics, as intestinal failure, where the 
available scientific evidence is of poor quality, consensus documents add value 
in decision-making. Furthermore, HPN is a complex process and, although there is 
extensive experience in its application and even clinical practice guidelines, 
in daily practice there are uncertainties about its suitability, usefulness, 
rational use and associated costs. For this reason, this document of consensus 
has been carried out, using the GRADE method. With this document we intend to 
define our position with regard to the current use of HPN in our country and 
answer several controversial questions related to this treatment.

Publisher: La nutrición parenteral en domicilio (NPD) es una técnica que ha

enfermedades graves resultantes en un fallo intestinal que hacía imposible su 
nutrición por otros métodos. Esta está indicada si existe un fallo intestinal 
documentado (entendido como la reducción de la función intestinal al mínimo 
hasta el punto de que se requiere suplementación intravenosa para mantener la 
salud y/o el crecimiento) con imposibilidad para la nutrición exclusiva por vía 
oral/enteral, posibilidad de manejo del enfermo en el domicilio y que no exista 
una expectativa corta de supervivencia, teniendo en cuenta la calidad de vida 
del paciente, el entorno familiar y la capacidad del paciente y/o de sus 
cuidadores de entrenamiento para la terapia de NPD.En los problemas de salud 
poco prevalentes, como es el fallo intestinal, en los cuales la evidencia 
científica disponible es de baja calidad, los documentos de consenso/expertos 
aportan valor en la toma de decisiones. Se suma a ello que la NPD es un proceso 
muy complejo y, a pesar de que existe una amplia experiencia en su aplicación e 
incluso guías de práctica clínica, en la práctica diaria se plantean 
incertidumbres acerca de su conveniencia, utilidad, uso racional y costes 
asociados. Por este motivo se ha realizado este documento de consenso, 
utilizando el método GRADE, con el que pretendemos definir nuestra posición con 
respecto al uso actual de la NPD en nuestro país y dar respuesta a una serie de 
preguntas que generan controversia en relación a este tratamiento.

Deletion of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene Dα1 confers 
insecticide resistance, but at what cost?

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have vital functions in processes of 
neurotransmission that underpin key behaviors. These pentameric ligand-gated ion 
channels have been used as targets for insecticides that constitutively activate 
them, causing the death of insect pests. In examining a knockout of the Dα1 
nAChR subunit gene, our study linked this one subunit with multiple traits. We 
were able to confirm previous work that had identified Dα1 as a target of the 
neonicotinoid class of insecticides. Further, we uncovered roles for the gene in 
influencing mating behavior and patterns of sleep. The knockout mutant was also 
observed to have a significant reduction in longevity. This study highlighted 
the severe fitness costs that appear to be associated with the loss of function 
of this gene in natural populations in the absence of insecticides targeting the 
Dα1 subunit. Such a fitness cost could explain why target site resistances to 
neonicotinoids in pest insect populations have been associated specific amino 
acid replacement mutations in nAChR subunits, rather than loss of function. That 
mutant phenotypes were observed for the two behaviors examined indicates that 
the functions of Dα1, and other nAChR subunits, need to be explored more 
broadly. It also remains to be established whether these phenotypes were due to 
loss of the Dα1 receptor and/or to compensatory changes in the expression levels 
of other nAChR subunits.

Novel TREM-1 Inhibitors Attenuate Tumor Growth and Prolong Survival in 
Experimental Pancreatic Cancer.

Shen ZT(1), Sigalov AB(1).

Author information:

States.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal cancer with an urgent need to expand 
the limited treatment options for patients. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) 
promote tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. High expression of triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) on TAMs directly correlates with 
poor survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have 
previously hypothesized that blockade of TREM-1 could be a promising therapeutic 
strategy to treat cancer and shown that the novel, ligand-independent TREM-1 
inhibitory peptides rationally designed using the signaling chain 
homooligomerization (SCHOOL) strategy suppress NSCLC growth in vivo. Here, we 
evaluated the therapeutic potential of these inhibitors in three human PC 
xenograft mouse models. Administration of SCHOOL peptides resulted in a strong 
antitumor effect achieving an optimal treatment/control (T/C) value of 19% 
depending on the xenograft and formulation used and persisting even after 
treatment was halted. The effect correlated significantly with increased 
survival and suppressed TAM infiltration. The peptides were well-tolerated when 
deployed either in free form or formulated into lipopeptide complexes for 
peptide half-life extension and targeted delivery. Finally, blockade of TREM-1 
significantly reduced serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-6, and macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), but not vascular endothelial growth factor, 
suggesting M-CSF-dependent antitumor mechanisms. Collectively, these promising 
data suggest that SCHOOL TREM-1-specific peptide inhibitors have a cancer type 
independent, therapeutically beneficial antitumor activity and can be 
potentially used as a stand-alone therapy or as a component of combinational 
therapy for PC, NSCLC, and other solid tumors.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to estimate life expectancy and the 
average lifetime with and without chronic disease among male never smokers, 
ex-smokers and smokers living in the West Bank of the occupied Palestinian 
territory.
METHODS: The study used a life table for the West Bank male population and 
Danish relative risk estimates for death for smokers and ex-smokers vs. never 
smokers and utilized data from the Palestinian Family Survey 2010. Expected 
lifetime with and without chronic disease was estimated and the contributions 
from the mortality and the morbidity effect to smoking related difference in 
average lifetime with and without chronic disease were assessed by 
decomposition.
RESULTS: In the West bank 40% of the male population are smokers. Life 
expectancy of 15-year-old Palestinian men who would never start smoking was 59.5 
years, 41.1 of which were expected to be without chronic disease. Ex-smokers 
could expect 57.9 years of remaining lifetime, 37.7 years of which without 
disease. For lifelong heavy smokers (> 20 cigarettes per day), the expected 
lifetime was reduced to 52.6 years, of which 38.5 years were without chronic 
disease. Of the total loss of 6.9 years of life expectancy among heavy smokers, 
the mortality effect accounted for 2.5 years without and 4.4 years with disease, 
whereas the morbidity effect was negligible.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of smoking causes a considerable loss of life 
years and lifetime without chronic disease. We recommend the Palestinian health 
authorities to enforce the anti-smoking law.

Bone cancer pain (BCP) is a severe type of hyperpathic pain occurring with 
primary bone tumors or advanced cancers which metastasize to bones. BCP can 
detrimentally reduce quality of life and presents a challenge to modern 
medicine. Studies have shown that exogenous H2S may act as a neuroprotectant to 
protect against some diseases in central nervous system. The preset study aimed 
to investigate the antinociceptive effect of H2S in BCP. We first measured the 
changes of serum H2S in patients with BCP and analyzed the relationship between 
them, then investigated the effect of H2S preconditioning on BCP, and explored 
the mechanism in rat model. Our results revealed that serum H2S level was 
negatively correlated with pain scores. In the rat model of BCP, preconditioning 
with H2S significantly reduced BCP, demonstrated by the decrease of thermal 
hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. The mechanism of H2S preconditioning may 
involve microglia deactivation and inflammation inhibition in the spinal cord, 
in which the proliferator-activated receptor gamma/p38/Jun N-terminal kinase 
pathway is activated. Impact statement Bone cancer pain (BCP) significantly 
decreases the life quality of patients or their life expectancy and causes a 
severe health burden to the society. However, as the exact mechanism of BCP is 
still poorly understood, no effective treatment has been developed yet. There 
are some pain medicines now, but they have some inevitable side effects. 
Additional therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. First, we revealed that 
preconditioning with H2S significantly reduced BCP, demonstrated by the decrease 
of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. Second, the mechanism of H2S 
preconditioning was elucidated. It may involve microglia deactivation and 
inflammation inhibition in the spinal cord, in which the proliferator-activated 
receptor gamma/p38/Jun N-terminal kinase pathway is activated. This novel 
finding may significantly help us to understand the difference between the roles 
of endogenous H2S and exogenous H2S in the development of BCP and present us a 
new strategy of pain management.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the serious non communicable 
diseases worldwide. Presence of DM patient in a family may be considered as risk 
factor for other family members to acquire the disease, due to DM inheritance 
nature and/or similar life style pattern among family members. This paper 
assessed awareness of DM patients' family members (DMPFMs) about DM occurrence 
and prevention. A cross sectional study was conducted in 2014 in two suburban 
cities of Ethiopia, namely Kemisse, and Kombolcha using an interviewer 
administered questionnaire among primary or secondary degree DMPFMs and 
controls. Based on eligibility criteria study participants were selected by 
health extension workers on house to house visit. Data were analyzed using SPSS 
version 20, and P value less than 0.05 considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS: Of the total 347 study participants, 45.5% (n = 158) had DMPFMs. 
Majority, 60.8% of DMPFMs and 73.0% of controls were males. Mean age of DMPFMs 
(30.06 years) was less than that of the controls (37.38 years). On living style, 
51.9% DMPFMs, and 42.8% of controls were single. In both study groups, the 
majority of study participants attended grade 7-12. The likelihood of having 
good level of knowledge among DMPFMs were 2.94 times (AOR = 2.94 95% CI 
1.87-4.86) higher compared to those who did not. Those attaining higher 
educational levels were 3.41 times (AOR = 3.41, 95% CI 1.31-8.91) more likely to 
have good level of knowledge, as compared to those who were unable to read and 
write. The likelihood of having good level of positive practice among DMPFMs 
were 3.38 times (AOR = 3.38% CI 2.05-5.58) higher as compared to controls. 
Participants who were living in Kombolcha were 2.33 times (AOR = 2.33 95% CI 
1.31-4.12) more likely to have good level of practice, as compared to 
individuals from Kemisse.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus family members in the Ethiopian suburban cities 
Kemisse, and Kombolcha had better knowledge and practice about DM compared to 
controls. But, the overall awareness about DM occurrence and prevention was 
relatively low. Thus, DM awareness campaigns should be strongly pursued 
regardless of family history and educational background to prevent further 
increase of DM in Ethiopia.

Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for older men remains an unproven 
intervention in terms of both cancer control and functional and voiding 
outcomes. We highlight some of the evidence against radical surgery for older 
men while acknowledging that this is the direction of travel.

Palliative and end of life care are essential, but largely overlooked, aspects 
of comprehensive, personalised diabetes care. Life expectancy is lower in people 
with diabetes than in the general population due to complications and 
comorbidities, especially those associated with obesity such as cardiovascular 
disease, frailty and cancer. This paper makes the case for early initiation of 
palliative care and proactive planning for end of life. Early use of palliative 
care improves symptom management, comfort and quality of life, and often 
improves function. Significantly, it reduces disease burden and unnecessary 
treatment. Prognostication is challenging, but tools such as the Gold Standard 
Framework and diabetes-related indicators of reduced life expectancy can help 
identify those at high risk one year mortality. Skilled conversations, 
underpinned by an evidence-based framework, are a critical component in helping 
people with diabetes, and their families, discuss these complex issues and make 
appropriate advance care plans based on their values and preferences.

[Wilson's disease : What has been confirmed in diagnostic and therapy?].

Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
abnormal copper accumulation. Presenting a broad variety of phenotypes and, 
thus, being a chameleon within the group of metabolic diseases, the manifold 
clinical symptoms of WD can include hepatologic, neurologic, and psychiatric 
manifestations. Early onset presentations in infancy and late-onset 
manifestations in adults older than 70 years of age have been described. If the 
typical laboratory blood test values are missing, the diagnosis of WD may be 
difficult and often involves a combination of different parameters. Novel test 
methods like the identification of the relative exchangeable copper have not 
been validated within a sufficient cohort of WD patients as of yet and therefore 
do not currently play a crucial role within the clinical setting. Consequently 
any patient with reasonable suspected diagnosis of WD needs to be presented to 
a (pediatric) gastroenterologist and/or (pediatric) neurologist. Different 
medical treatments including drugs such as copper chelating agents are commonly 
used in the clinical setting. Liver transplantation may be the ultima ratio in 
selected patients. Dietary changes involving a low copper diet play only a minor 
role. Due to the fact the use of tetrathiomolybdate is still not approved, the 
treatment of advanced and progressive neurologic symptoms remains a major 
challenge. In any case, life-long medical supervision and treatment governed by 
a specialist is absolutely essential. Early diagnosis and early and life-long 
treatment lead to better prognoses and do not negatively influence the overall 
life expectancy.

Trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease of both livestock and humans. 
Although pastoral communities of the Maasai Steppe have been able to adapt to 
trypanosomiasis in the past, their traditional strategies are now constrained by 
changes in climate and land regimes that affect their ability to move with their 
herds and continually shape the communities' vulnerability to trypanosomiasis. 
Despite these constraints, information on communities' vulnerability and 
adaptive capacity to trypanosomiasis is limited. A cross-sectional study was 
therefore conducted in Simanjiro and Monduli districts of the Maasai Steppe to 
establish pastoralists' vulnerability to animal trypanosomiasis and factors that 
determined their adaptation strategies. A weighted overlay approach in ArcGIS 
10.4 was used to analyze vulnerability levels while binomial and multinomial 
logistic regressions in R 3.3.2 were used to analyze the determinants of 
adaptation. Simanjiro district was the most vulnerable to trypanosomiasis. The 
majority (87.5%, n = 136) of the respondents were aware of trypanosomiasis in 
animals, but only 7.4% (n = 136) knew about the human form of the disease. 
Reported impacts of animal trypanosomiasis were low milk production (95.6%, 
n = 136), death of livestock (96.8%, n = 136) and emaciation of animals (99.9%, 
n = 136). Crop farming was the most frequently reported animal trypanosomiasis 
adaptation strategy (66%, n = 136). At a 95% confidence interval, accessibility 
to livestock extension services (β = 7.61, SE = 3.28, df = 135, P = 0.02), years 
of livestock keeping experience (β = 6.17, SE = 1.95, df = 135, P = 0.001), 
number of cattle owned (β = 5.85, SE = 2.70, df = 135, P = 0.03) and membership 
in associations (β = - 4.11, SE = 1.79, df = 135, P = 0.02) had a significant 
impact on the probability of adapting to animal trypanosomiasis.

PURPOSE: Since combined strategy with cisplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan has 
shown the superiority to topotecan alone as second-line chemotherapy in patients 
with sensitive relapsed small-cell lung cancer, this study aimed to compare 
these two treatments based on JCOG0605 trail from Chinese cost-effectiveness 
perspective.
METHODS: Basic medical information was derived from a multicenter, open-label, 
randomized phase III trial (JCOG0605). A Markov model including three health 
states: progression-free state, progressive disease (PD), and death, was 
developed to simulate the process of sensitive relapsed small-cell lung cancer. 
Cost was calculated from the perspective of Chinese society. Sensitivity 
analyses were applied to explore the impact of essential variables.
RESULTS: Treatment with combination chemotherapy was estimated to increase costs 
by $6947.32 compared with topotecan alone, with a gain of 0.26 quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). Thus, the incremental cost-effective ratio was 
$26720.46/QALY for combination treatment versus monotherapy, which was beyond 
the threshold of 3 × the per capita GDP of China, $24423.00. The costs of PD 
state were the most influential factors to the model.
CONCLUSION: The combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and 
irinotecan was not a cost-effectiveness choice for patients with sensitive 
relapsed SCLC in China from the cost-effectiveness perspective.

Since the publication of the first vascular access clinical practice guidelines 
in 1997, the global nephrology community has dedicated significant time and 
resources toward increasing the prevalence of arteriovenous fistulas and 
decreasing the prevalence of central venous catheters for hemodialysis. These 
efforts have been bolstered by observational studies showing an association 
between catheter use and increased patient morbidity and mortality. To date, 
however, no randomized comparisons of the outcomes of different forms of 
vascular access have been conducted. There is mounting evidence that much of the 
difference in patient outcomes may be explained by patient factors, rather than 
choice of vascular access. Some have called into question the appropriateness of 
fistula creation for certain patient populations, such as those with limited 
life expectancy and those at high risk of fistula-related complications. In this 
review, we explore the extent to which catheters and fistulas exhibit the 
characteristics of the "ideal" vascular access and highlight the significant 
knowledge gaps that exist in the current literature. Further studies, ideally 
randomized comparisons of different forms of vascular access, are required to 
better inform shared decision making.

OBJECTIVE: To illustrate how decision modeling may identify relevant uncertainty 
and can preclude or identify areas of future research in surgery.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: To optimize use of research resources, a tool is needed 
that assists in identifying relevant uncertainties and the added value of 
reducing these uncertainties.
METHODS: The clinical pathway for laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) 
versus open (ODP) for nonmalignant lesions was modeled in a decision tree. 
Cost-effectiveness based on complications, hospital stay, costs, quality of 
life, and survival was analyzed. The effect of existing uncertainty on the 
cost-effectiveness was addressed, as well as the expected value of eliminating 
uncertainties.
RESULTS: Based on 29 nonrandomized studies (3.701 patients) the model shows that 
LDP is more cost-effective compared with ODP. Scenarios in which LDP does not 
outperform ODP for cost-effectiveness seem unrealistic, e.g., a 30-day mortality 
rate of 1.79 times higher after LDP as compared with ODP, conversion in 62.2%, 
surgically repair of incisional hernias in 21% after LDP, or an average 2.3 days 
longer hospital stay after LDP than after ODP. Taking all uncertainty into 
account, LDP remained more cost-effective. Minimizing these uncertainties did 
not change the outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show how decision analytical modeling can help to 
identify relevant uncertainty and guide decisions for future research in 
surgery. Based on the current available evidence, a randomized clinical trial on 
complications, hospital stay, costs, quality of life, and survival is highly 
unlikely to change the conclusion that LDP is more cost-effective than ODP.

Health, Baltimore, MD.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective comparative study.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare functional outcomes, hospital 
resource utilization, and spine-related costs during 2 years in patients who had 
undergone primary or revision surgery for adult spinal deformity (ASD).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: After surgery for ASD, patients may require revision 
for pseudarthrosis, implant complications, or deformity progression. Data 
evaluating cost-effectiveness of primary and, in particular, revision surgery, 
for ASD are sparse.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records for 119 consecutive patients who 
had undergone primary or revision surgery for ASD. Two-year total spine-related 
medical costs were derived from hospital charge data. Functional outcome scores 
were extracted from prospectively collected patient data. Cost utility ratios 
(cost/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) at 2 years were calculated and assessed 
against a threshold of $154,458/QALY gained (three times the 2015 US per-capita 
gross domestic product).
RESULTS: The primary surgery cohort (n = 56) and revision cohort (n = 63) showed 
significant improvements in health-related quality-of-life scores at 2 years. 
Median surgical and spine-related 2-year follow-up costs were $137,990 
(interquartile range [IQR], $84,186) for primary surgery and $115,509 (IQR, 
$63,753) for revision surgery and were not significantly different between the 
two groups (P = 0.12). We report 2-year QALY gains of 0.36 in the primary 
surgery cohort and 0.40 in the revision group (P = 0.71). Primary instrumented 
fusion was associated with a median 2-year cost per QALY of $197,809 (IQR, 
$187,350) versus $129,950 (IQR, $209,928) for revision surgery (P = 0.31).
CONCLUSION: Revision surgery had lower total 2-year costs and higher QALY gains 
than primary surgery for ASD, although the differences were not significant. 
Although revision surgery for ASD is known to be technically challenging and to 
have a higher rate of major complications than primary surgery, revision surgery 
was cost-effective at 2 years. The cost/QALY ratio for primary surgery for ASD 
exceeded the threshold for cost effectiveness at 2 years.

CBP-1 Acts in GABAergic Neurons to Double Life Span in Axenically Cultured 
Caenorhabditis elegans.

When cultured in axenic medium, Caenorhabditis elegans shows the largest 
life-span extension compared with other dietary restriction regimens. However, 
the underlying molecular mechanism still remains elusive. The gene cbp-1, 
encoding the worm ortholog of p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein), is one of the 
very few key genes known to be essential for life span doubling under axenic 
dietary restriction (ADR). By using tissue-specific RNAi, we found that cbp-1 
expression in the germline is essential for fertility, whereas this gene 
functions specifically in the GABAergic neurons to support the full life 
span-doubling effect of ADR. Surprisingly, GABA itself is not required for 
ADR-induced longevity, suggesting a role of neuropeptide signaling. In addition, 
chemotaxis assays illustrate that neuronal inactivation of CBP-1 affects the 
animals' food sensing behavior. Together, our results show that the strong 
life-span extension in axenic medium is under strict control of GABAergic 
neurons and may be linked to food sensing.

BACKGROUND: The economic determinants of health have been widely recognised as 
crucial factors affecting health; however, to date, no comprehensive review has 
been undertaken to summarise these factors and the ways in which they can 
influence health. We conceptualise the economy as a complex system made up of 
underlying approaches, regulation from institutions, markets, finance, labour, 
the public-private balance as well as production and distributional effects, 
which collectively impact on health through the effect of moderators. This 
protocol details the methods for an umbrella review to explore the 
macro-economic factors, strategies, policies and interventions that affect 
health outcomes and health inequalities.
METHODS: We will identify relevant systematic reviews using search terms derived 
from the Journal of Economic Literature classification. Reviews will be included 
if they meet the Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effects criteria for 
systematic reviews. Reviews of studies with and without controls will be 
included; both association and intervention studies will be included. Primary 
outcomes will include but are not limited to morbidity, mortality, prevalence 
and incidence of conditions and life expectancy. Secondary outcomes will include 
health inequalities by gender, ethnicity or socio-economic status. Six databases 
will be searched using tailored versions of our piloted search strategy to 
locate relevant reviews. Data will be extracted using a standardized pro forma, 
and the findings will be synthesized into a conceptual framework to address our 
review aim.
DISCUSSION: Our umbrella review protocol provides a robust method to 
systematically appraise the evidence in this field, using new conceptual models 
derived specifically to address the study question. This will yield important 
information for policymakers, practitioners and researchers at the local, 
national and international level. It will also help set the future research 
agenda in this field and guide the development of interventions.
