Since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), the life 
expectancy has increased for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV). This has been associated with reductions in the incidences of some 
AIDS-defining malignancies, such as Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but 
has coincided with an increased incidence of non-AIDS-defining malignancies, 
such as anal cancer. However, anal cancers are rare in patients with HIV in 
Japan. We report the case of an HIV-infected patient with anal cancer treated 
with chemoradiotherapy. A 37-year-old man receiving ART for HIV infection 
presented with a 1-month history of left inguinal lymphadenopathy and anal pain. 
Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography revealed a 56-mm mass, left 
inguinal lymphadenopathy, and left external iliac lymphadenopathy. The mass had 
infiltrated from the anal canal to the right levator ani and corpus spongiosum. 
Colonoscopy revealed a tumor with an ulcer in the anal canal. Histological 
examination of the tumor biopsy specimens confirmed the diagnosis of squamous 
cell carcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with anal cancer (T4N2M1 stage IV), 
and he received 5-fluorouracil (1000mg/m(2) on days 1-4 and 29-32) plus 
mitomycin C (10mg/m(2) on days 1 and 29) and concurrent radiotherapy (total 
dose, 59.4Gy in 33 fractions) along with ART. The treatment-related adverse 
events were grade 4 leukopenia and neutropenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and 
grade 2 radiation dermatitis. Moreover, CD4 suppression was observed:the CD4 
count decreased from 190 cells/μl before chemoradiotherapy to 138 cells/μl after 
3 months, but increased to 210 cells/μl after 1 year. Because of the grade 4 
leukopenia and neutropenia, the dose of 5-fluorouracil was reduced to 800mg/m(2) 
on days 29-32. A complete response was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging, 
and colonoscopy confirmed the disappearance of the anal cancer. The patient is 
living with no signs of recurrence at 2 years after chemoradiotherapy. When 
treating HIV-infected patients with anal cancer by chemoradiotherapy and ART, 
clinicians should be aware of the possibility of CD4 suppression.

Objectives Cost-effectiveness of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in the 
treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Methods Costs, clinical 
outcomes, and QALYs were estimated using a Markov model. Febuxostat 80 mg and 
120 mg sequentially, used as first line and second line therapy, was compared 
with allopurinol 300 mg. Patients switched to the next treatment in the sequence 
according to a dichotomous response vs no response (target serum urate level < 
6 mg/dl outcome) after 3 months of active treatment. A 3% discount rate and 
5-year time horizon were applied.
PERSPECTIVE: National Health System. Results The addition of febuxostat to any 
therapeutic strategy was an efficient option, with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) compared with allopurinol 300 mg ranging from 
€5268-€9737. Conclusions Febuxostat is a cost-effective treatment in Spain for 
the management of hyperuricemia in gout patients, with ICERs far below accepted 
Spanish efficiency thresholds (30 000€/QALY).

BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive endoscopic endonasal approaches to the ventral 
skull base have evolved considerably over the past several years. However, where 
there is a lateral extension of tumors as far as the parapharyngeal spaces with 
inferior extension below the level of the soft palate, limitations remain for an 
exclusive transnasal approach.
METHODS: A combined endoscopic-assisted transnasal-transoral-transpharyngeal 
multiportal approach was performed to resect selected skull base malignancies 
that could not be adequately managed using a single approach.
RESULTS: Three cases of skull base cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, polymorphous 
low-grade adenocarcinoma, and high-grade osteosarcoma) were suitable for such an 
approach. In all cases, a radical resection was obtained without major 
complications and with minimal morbidity for the patient.
CONCLUSION: The transnasal, transoral, and transpharyngeal surgical windows are 
complementary approaches that, when combined, provide excellent exposure for 
selected skull base malignancies that have extended too laterally and inferiorly 
to allow an exclusively transnasal approach. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Head Neck

University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.

OBJECTIVE: Recent literature reports that radical hysterectomy followed by 
adjuvant radiotherapy has comparable progression-free survival and overall 
survival compared to radical radiotherapy for International Federation of 
Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB cervical cancer. Now, we evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness (CE) of these two treatment regimens.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: A decision-tree model was constructed 
comparing CE between treatment arms using the published studies for overall 
survival rates and treatment-related toxicity rates for 5 years. The cost data 
were obtained from the hospital system of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an 
Jiaotong University. Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY). Treatment arms were compared with regard to costs and life expectancy 
using incremental CE ratio, and the results were presented using costs per QALY.
RESULTS: The mean cost was $10,872 for radical hysterectomy followed by adjuvant 
radiotherapy versus $5,702 for radical radiotherapy. The incremental CE ratio 
for surgery-based treatment compared to radiotherapy-based treatment was 
-$76,453 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Radical radiotherapy would be a cost-effective method for FIGO stage 
IIB cervical cancer and would be favored in settings where resources are 
limited.

INTRODUCTION: Radical prostatectomy (RP) is considered the best treatment for 
the management of localized prostate cancer in patients with life expectancy 
over 10 years. However, a complete recovery is not guaranteed for all patients 
who received/underwent RP treatment. Biochemical recurrence is frequently 
observed during the post-operative follow-up period. The main objective in this 
study is to evaluate the predictive factors of biochemical recurrence in 
localized prostate cancer patients who underwent RP surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 352 patients with prostate cancer 
treated by RP at a single institution between February 2004 and June 2014. 
Detailed pathological and follow-up data of all patients were obtained and 
analyzed to determine the results.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up duration was 39.7 months. 83 patients (23%) experienced 
biochemical recurrence (BCR) during the follow-up period. Mean BCR duration 
range was 6.56 (1-41) months. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, 
Gleason score (GS), PSA and extra-capsular tumour spread (ECS) variables were 
found to be statistically significant as BCR predictive factors.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our study results, it is thought that PSA, GS and ECS 
can all be used for guidance in choosing a treatment modality for post-RP 
biochemical recurrence and metastatic disease as predictive factors. However, 
there is no consensus in this matter and it is still debated.

The use of postoperative radiation after nipple sparing mastectomy.

Milan, Italy.

Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) is a surgical procedure designed to reduce the 
disabling psychological effects of radical mastectomy. The preservation of the 
nipple-areola complex (NAC) produces a better result of the breast 
reconstruction, but some concerns exist of increasing the risk for local 
recurrence (LR). To reduce this risk a restricted inclusion criteria is 
suggested. In case of patients with high or intermediate risk the use of 
radiation therapy (RT) is also recommended, but a current standard for radiation 
after NSM is not available. In the literature, with few exceptions, there are 
few reports detailing indication and technique of radiation after NSM. There is 
a general consensus that post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) should be 
considered for patients with four or more positive axillary lymph nodes, primary 
tumour size 5 cm or more, T4 disease for skin involvement and positive margin. 
Almost all of these patients are candidate to receive external beam radiotherapy 
to the chest wall and to the supraclavicular/axillary region, less to the 
internal mammary chain. PMRT could be omitted in elderly patients with poor 
clinical conditions or co-morbidities that substantially reduce the life 
expectancy. Because the indications of NSM have been progressively extended also 
to larger or multi-centric tumours, this procedure has been criticised because 
of the increased risk of recurrence behind the areola due to the remaining 
glandular tissue, especially the terminal ducts, kept to preserve its blood 
supply, and especially in case of more advanced tumours. To reduce this concern, 
adjuvant RT after NSM should be administered in high risk patients who meet the 
criteria for current recommendations, but in other cases, such as in patients 
with intermediate risk or lower stage, the indication should be discussed on 
individual.

BACKGROUND: An "obesity paradox" has been described in patients with acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI), whereby obese and overweight patients have a lower 
risk of short-term mortality after AMI than normal-weight patients. However, the 
long-term association of obesity with mortality after AMI remains unknown.
METHODS: We used data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a prospective 
medical record study of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with AMI with 17 
years of follow-up (N = 124,981), to evaluate the association of higher body 
mass index (BMI) with short- and long-term survival after AMI. Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to estimate life expectancy after AMI and the years of 
potential life lost or gained attributable to excess weight.
RESULTS: Approximately 41.5% of patients were classified as normal weight; 
38.7%, as overweight; 14.3%, as obese; and 5.5%, as morbidly obese. 
Normal-weight patients had the highest crude mortality at all follow-up time 
points, whereas obese patients had the lowest. Adjustment for patient and 
treatment characteristics reduced this difference, but the survival benefit 
persisted in overweight and obese patients at all time points. Morbidly obese 
and normal-weight patients had a comparable risk of death at 17 years. Life 
expectancy estimates were generally lowest for morbidly obese patients and 
highest for overweight patients. Differences in life expectancy between BMI 
groups were most pronounced in younger patients. After adjustment, overweight 
and obesity were associated with greater life years at all ages; however, morbid 
obesity was only associated with better survival in patients ≥75 years of age at 
the time of AMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity are associated with improved short- and 
long-term survival after AMI, which results in moderate gains in life expectancy 
relative to normal-weight patients. These findings suggest that higher BMI 
confers a protective advantage over the entire remaining lifespan in older 
patients with AMI.

OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular and metabolic traits (CMT) are influenced by complex 
interactive processes including diet, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition. The 
present study investigated the interactions of these risk factors in relation to 
CMTs in the Turkish population.
METHODS: We applied bootstrap agglomerative hierarchical clustering and Bayesian 
network learning algorithms to identify the causative relationships among genes 
involved in different biological mechanisms (i.e., lipid metabolism, hormone 
metabolism, cellular detoxification, aging, and energy metabolism), lifestyle 
(i.e., physical activity, smoking behavior, and metropolitan residency), 
anthropometric traits (i.e., body mass index, body fat ratio, and waist-to-hip 
ratio), and dietary habits (i.e., daily intakes of macro- and micronutrients) in 
relation to CMTs (i.e., health conditions and blood parameters).
RESULTS: We identified significant correlations between dietary habits (soybean 
and vitamin B12 intakes) and different cardiometabolic diseases that were 
confirmed by the Bayesian network-learning algorithm. Genetic factors 
contributed to these disease risks also through the pleiotropy of some genetic 
variants (i.e., F5 rs6025 and MTR rs180508). However, we also observed that 
certain genetic associations are indirect since they are due to the causative 
relationships among the CMTs (e.g., APOC3 rs5128 is associated with low-density 
lipoproteins cholesterol and, by extension, total cholesterol).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study applied a novel approach to integrate various sources of 
information and dissect the complex interactive processes related to CMTs. Our 
data indicated that complex causative networks are present: causative 
relationships exist among CMTs and are affected by genetic factors (with 
pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic effects) and dietary habits.

PURPOSE: Aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (aNHL) is associated with poor 
long-term survival after relapse, and treatment is limited by a lack of 
consensus regarding standard of care. Pixantrone was studied in a randomized 
trial in patients with relapsed or refractory aNHL who had failed ≥ 2 lines of 
therapy, demonstrating a significant improvement in complete or unconfirmed 
complete response and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with 
investigators' choice of single-agent therapy. The objective of this study was 
to assess the health economic implications of pixantrone versus current clinical 
practice (CCP) in the United Kingdom for patients with multiply relapsed or 
refractory aNHL receiving their third or fourth line of treatment.
METHODS: A semi-Markov partition model based on overall survival and PFS was 
developed to evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic impact of treatment of 
multiply relapsed or refractory aNHL with pixantrone versus CCP. The empirical 
overall survival and PFS data from the PIX301 trial were extrapolated to a 
lifetime horizon. Resource use was elicited from clinical experts, and unit 
costs and utilities were obtained from published sources. The analysis was 
conducted from the perspective of the United Kingdom's National Health Service 
and personal social services. Outcomes evaluated were total costs, life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost per QALY gained. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty around 
the results.
FINDINGS: Pixantrone was estimated to increase life expectancy by a mean of 10.8 
months per patient compared with CCP and a mean gain of 0.56 discounted QALYs. 
The increased health gains were associated with an increase in discounted costs 
of approximately £18,494 per patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of pixantrone versus CCP was £33,272 per QALY gained. Sensitivity and scenario 
analyses suggest that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was sensitive to 
uncertainty in the PFS and overall survival estimates and the utility values 
associated with each health state.
IMPLICATIONS: Pixantrone may be considered both clinically effective and 
cost-effective for patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aNHL who 
currently have a high level of unmet need.

INTRODUCTION: HIV drug treatment has greatly improved life expectancy, but 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease remains, potentially due to the 
additional burdens of infection, inflammation and antiretroviral treatment. The 
Mediterranean Diet has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk and mortality in 
the general population, but no evidence exists for this effect in the HIV 
population. This study will explore the feasibility of a randomised controlled 
trial (RCT) to examine whether a Mediterranean-style diet that incorporates a 
portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods, reduces cardiovascular risk in people 
with HIV dyslipidaemia.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 60 adults with stable HIV infection on antiretroviral 
treatment and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >3 mmol/L will be recruited 
from 3 West Midlands HIV services. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to 1 of 2 
dietary interventions, with stratification by gender and smoking status. 
Participants allocated to Diet1 will receive advice to reduce saturated fat 
intake, and those to Diet2 on how to adopt the Mediterranean Portfolio Diet with 
additional cholesterol-lowering foods (nuts, stanols, soya, oats, pulses). 
Measurements of fasting blood lipids, body composition and arterial stiffness 
will be conducted at baseline, and month 6 and 12 of the intervention. Food 
intake will be assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score, 3-day food diaries 
and metabolomic biomarkers. Questionnaires will be used to assess quality of 
life and process evaluation. Qualitative interviews will explore barriers and 
facilitators to making dietary changes, and participant views on the 
intervention. Qualitative data will be analysed using the Framework Method. 
Feasibility will be assessed in terms of trial recruitment, retention, 
compliance to study visits and the intervention. SD of outcomes will inform the 
power calculation of the definitive RCT.
ETHICS: The West Midlands Ethics Committee has approved this study and informed 
consent forms. This trial is the first to test cholesterol-lowering foods in 
adults with HIV.

Dietary protein intake might be beneficial to physical function (PF) in the 
elderly. We examined the cross-sectional and prospective associations of protein 
intake of g/kg body weight (BW), fat mass (FM) and lean mass (LM) with PF in 554 
women aged 65·3-71·6 years belonging to the Osteoporosis Risk Factor and 
Prevention Fracture Prevention Study. Participants filled a questionnaire on 
lifestyle factors and 3-d food record in 2002. Body composition was measured by 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and PF measures were performed at baseline and 
at 3-year follow-up. Sarcopaenia was defined using European Working Group on 
Sarcopenia in Older People criteria. At the baseline, women with higher protein 
intake (≥ 1·2 g/kg BW) had better performance in hand-grip strength/body mass 
(GS/BM) (P=0·001), knee extension/BM (P=0·003), one-leg stance (P=0·047), chair 
rise (P=0·043), squat (P=0·019), squat to the ground (P=0·001), faster walking 
speed for 10 m (P=0·005) and higher short physical performance battery score 
(P=0·004) compared with those with moderate and lower intakes (0·81-1·19 and ≤ 
0·8 g/kg BW, respectively). In follow-up results, higher protein intake was 
associated with less decline in GS/BM, one-leg stance and tandem walk for 6 m 
over 3 years. Overall, results were no longer significant after controlling for 
FM. Associations were detected between protein intake and PF in non-sarcopaenic 
women but not in sarcopaenic women, except for change of GS (P=0·037). Further, 
FM but not LM was negatively associated with PF measures (P<0·050). This study 
suggests that higher protein intake and lower FM might be positively associated 
with PF in elderly women.

This study aimed to critically review methods for ranking risks related to food 
safety and dietary hazards on the basis of their anticipated human health 
impacts. A literature review was performed to identify and characterize methods 
for risk ranking from the fields of food, environmental science and 
socio-economic sciences. The review used a predefined search protocol, and 
covered the bibliographic databases Scopus, CAB Abstracts, Web of Sciences, and 
PubMed over the period 1993-2013. All references deemed relevant, on the basis 
of predefined evaluation criteria, were included in the review, and the risk 
ranking method characterized. The methods were then clustered-based on their 
characteristics-into eleven method categories. These categories included: risk 
assessment, comparative risk assessment, risk ratio method, scoring method, cost 
of illness, health adjusted life years (HALY), multi-criteria decision analysis, 
risk matrix, flow charts/decision trees, stated preference techniques and expert 
synthesis. Method categories were described by their characteristics, weaknesses 
and strengths, data resources, and fields of applications. It was concluded 
there is no single best method for risk ranking. The method to be used should be 
selected on the basis of risk manager/assessor requirements, data availability, 
and the characteristics of the method. Recommendations for future use and 
application are provided.

BACKGROUND: Blunt cardiac injury severe enough to require surgical intervention 
(sBCI) is an exceedingly rare event occurring in approximately 1 out of every 
1600 trauma patients. While performing the cardiac component of the Focused 
Assessment of Sonography in Trauma (cFAST) exam is effective in penetrating 
trauma, it is unclear whether it is of value in blunt trauma given the low 
prevalence of sBCI, the imperfect test characteristics of the FAST exam, and the 
rate of incidental pericardial effusion.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine through decision analysis whether 
performing the cFAST exam is cost-effective in the evaluation of hypotensive and 
normotensive blunt trauma patients.
METHODS: We created two decision analytic models using commercially available 
software (TreeAgePro2011) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the cFAST in 
hypotensive (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and normotensive blunt trauma 
patients. Clinical probabilities were obtained from published data. Costs were 
estimated from Medicare reimbursement and charge data. The willingness-to-pay 
threshold was $50,000/quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses 
were performed over plausible ranges using available literature.
RESULTS: In hypotensive patients, for the base case scenario of a 34-year-old 
with blunt trauma, the cFAST strategy had a cost of $42,882.70 and an 
effectiveness of 25.3597 QALYs, whereas the no cFAST strategy had a cost of 
$42,753.52 and an effectiveness of 25.3532 QALYs. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $19,918/QALY. For normotensive patients the 
cFAST strategy had a cost of $18,331.03 and an effectiveness of 23.2817 QALYs, 
whereas the no cFAST strategy had a cost of $18,207.58 and an effectiveness of 
23.2814 QALYs. The ICER was $465,867/QALY. In the sensitivity analyses, age, 
probability of death from sBCI with prompt treatment, and probability of sBCI 
were the main drivers of variability in the model outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The cFAST for blunt trauma is cost-effective for hypotensive but 
not for normotensive patients. The ICER for hypotensive patients was more than 
20 times higher than the ICER for normotensive patients. Our results suggest 
that performing the cFAST exam may not be an effective use of resources in 
normotensive blunt trauma patients.

BACKGROUND: Females 80 years and older comprise 22% of the total U.S. survivor 
population, yet the impact of cancer on the physical well-being of women is this 
age group has not been well characterized.
METHODS: We compared women, 80 years of age and older in the Women's Health 
Initiative extension 2, who did (n = 2,270) and did not (n = 20,272) have an 
adjudicated history of cancer during Women's Health Initiative enrollment; 
analyses focused on women >2-years postcancer diagnosis. The physical 
functioning subscale of the RAND-36 was the primary outcome. Demographic, 
health-status, and psychosocial covariates were drawn from Women's Health 
Initiative assessments. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the effect of 
cancer history on physical function, with and without adjustment for covariates.
RESULTS: In adjusted models, women with a history of cancer reported 
significantly lower mean physical functioning (56.6, standard error [SE] 0.4) 
than those without a cancer history (58.0, SE 0.1), p = .002. In these models, 
younger current age, lower body mass index, increased physical activity, higher 
self-rated health, increased reported happiness, and the absence of noncancer 
comorbid conditions were all associated with higher physical functioning in both 
women with and without a history of cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Women older than 80 years of age with a cancer history have only a 
moderately lower level of physical function than comparably aged women without a 
cancer history. Factors associated with higher levels of physical functioning 
were similar in both groups.

BACKGROUND: As the proportion of the population aged 80 and over accelerates, so 
does the value of understanding the processes of aging well. The purposes of 
this article are to: (a) review contemporary theoretical and conceptual 
perspectives on aging well, (b) describe indicators of aging well that reflect 
key concepts and perspectives as assessed in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) 
and (c) characterize the status of aging among women aged 80 and older using 
data obtained from WHI participants at the WHI Extension 2 follow-up.
METHODS: Data from the Lifestyle Questionnaire, which was administered from 2011 
to 2012 during the WHI Follow-up Study (Extension 2), were analyzed to provide a 
profile of the WHI cohort with respect to aging well.
RESULTS: Data revealed substantial diversity in the cohort with respect to the 
various measures of aging well. Although many reported physical functioning 
levels consistent with disability, most rated their health as good or better. 
Most reported moderately high levels of resilience, self-control, and 
self-mastery but lower levels of environmental mastery. Finally, the cohort 
reported high levels of optimal aging as reflected by their high levels of 
emotional well-being and moderately high levels of life satisfaction and social 
support, but more modest levels of personal growth and purpose in life.
CONCLUSIONS: The wide range of some dimensions of aging well suggest that 
further examination of predictors of positive coping and resilience in the face 
of aging-related disability could identify opportunities to support and 
facilitate aging well among U.S. women.

BACKGROUND: We examined physical functioning (PF) trajectories (maintaining, 
slowly declining, and rapidly declining) spanning 15 years in older women aged 
65-80 and protective factors that predicted better current levels and less 
decline in functional independence outcomes after age 80.
METHODS: Women's Health Initiative extension participants who met criteria 
(enrolled in either the clinical trial or observational study cohort, >80 years 
at the data release cutoff, PF survey data from initial enrollment to age 80, 
and functional independence survey data after age 80) were included in these 
analyses (mean [SD] age = 84.0 [1.4] years; N = 10,478). PF was measured with 
the SF-36 (mean = 4.9 occasions). Functional independence was measured by 
self-reported level of dependence in basic and instrumental activities of daily 
living (ADLs and IADLs) (mean = 3.4 and 3.3 occasions).
RESULTS: Maintaining consistent PF in older adulthood extends functional 
independence in ADL and IADL in late-life. Protective factors shared by ADL and 
IADL include maintaining PF over time, self-reported excellent or very good 
health, no history of hip fracture after age 55, and no history of 
cardiovascular disease. Better IADL function is uniquely predicted by a body 
mass index less than 25 and no depression. Less ADL and IADL decline is 
predicted by better self-reported health, and less IADL decline is uniquely 
predicted by having no history of hip fracture after age 55.
CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining or improving PF and preventing injury and disease in 
older adulthood (ages 65-80) has far-reaching implications for improving 
late-life (after age 80) functional independence.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to constitute the leading cause of death 
globally. CVD risk stratification is an essential tool to sort through 
heterogeneous populations and identify individuals at risk of developing CVD. 
However, applications of current risk scores have recently been shown to result 
in considerable misclassification of high-risk subjects. In addition, despite 
long standing beneficial effects in secondary prevention, current CVD 
medications have in a primary prevention setting shown modest benefit in terms 
of increasing life expectancy. A systems biology approach to CVD risk 
stratification may be employed for improving risk-estimating algorithms through 
addition of high-throughput derived omics biomarkers. In addition, modeling of 
personalized benefit-of-treatment may help in guiding choice of intervention. In 
the area of medicine, realizing that CVD involves perturbations of large complex 
biological networks, future directions in drug development may involve moving 
away from a reductionist approach toward a system level approach. Here, we 
review current CVD risk scores and explore how novel algorithms could help to 
improve the identification of risk and maximize personalized treatment benefit. 
We also discuss possible future directions in the development of effective 
treatment strategies for CVD through the use of genome-scale metabolic models 
(GEMs) as well as other biological network-based approaches.

This study aimed to examine whether daily intake of citrus juice containing 
heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum YIT 0132 (LP0132-fermented juice) alleviates 
symptoms of atopic dermatitis. This was a natural extension of our previous 
study in which LP0132 was shown to enhance IL-10 production in vitro and 
LP0132-fermented juice was found to alleviate symptoms and enhance quality of 
life (QOL) in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis. In two open trials, Trial 
1 and Trial 2, 32 and 18 adult patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis 
consumed LP0132-fermented juice for 8 weeks. Skin conditions and QOL were 
subjectively evaluated using Skindex-16 before intake of the juice 
(Pre-treatment), 8 weeks after starting intake (Treatment) and 8 weeks after 
termination of intake (Post-treatment). Blood parameters were also analyzed. 
Comparison of the Treatment and Post-treatment time points with the 
Pre-treatment time point revealed significant reductions in the Skindex-16 
overall score and the 3 domain subscores (symptoms, emotions, and functioning 
domains) in both trials. Moreover, blood levels of eosinophil cationic protein 
(ECP), total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgEs for Japanese cedar and 
cypress pollen were significantly attenuated in Trial 2. The findings suggest 
that daily intake of citrus fermented juice containing heat-killed LP0132 has 
beneficial effects on symptoms and QOL in patients with mild to moderate atopic 
dermatitis due to an immunomodulatory effect via attenuation of IgE and ECP.

The ability to synthesize and propagate genetic information encoded in the 
framework of xeno-nucleic acid (XNA) polymers would inform a wide range of 
topics from the origins of life to synthetic biology. While directed evolution 
has produced examples of engineered polymerases that can accept XNA substrates, 
these enzymes function with reduced activity relative to their natural 
counterparts. Here, we describe a biochemical strategy that enables the 
discovery of engineered polymerases with improved activity for a given unnatural 
polymerase function. Our approach involves identifying specificity determining 
residues (SDRs) that control polymerase activity, screening mutations at SDR 
positions in a model polymerase scaffold, and assaying key gain-of-function 
mutations in orthologous protein architectures. By transferring beneficial 
mutations between homologous protein structures, we show that new polymerases 
can be identified that function with superior activity relative to their 
starting donor scaffold. This concept, which we call scaffold sampling, was used 
to generate engineered DNA polymerases that can faithfully synthesize RNA and 
TNA (threose nucleic acid), respectively, on a DNA template with high 
primer-extension efficiency and low template sequence bias. We suggest that the 
ability to combine phenotypes from different donor and recipient scaffolds 
provides a new paradigm in polymerase engineering where natural structural 
diversity can be used to refine the catalytic activity of synthetic enzymes.

BACKGROUND: Although life expectancy estimation is vital to decision making for 
localized prostate cancer, there are few, if any, valid and usable tools. Our 
goal was to create and validate a prediction model for other cause mortality in 
localized prostate cancer patients that could aid clinician's initial treatment 
decisions at the point of care.
METHODS: We combined an adjusted Social Security Administration table with a 
subset of comorbidities from a UK actuarial life expectancy model. Life tables 
were adjusted on the basis of survival data from a cohort of almost 10,000 
radical prostatectomy patients treated at four major US academic institutions. 
Comorbidity-specific odds ratios were calculated and incorporated with baseline 
risk of mortality. We externally validated the model on 2898 patients from the 
Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study, which included men diagnosed with prostate 
cancer in six SEER cancer registries. These men had sufficient follow-up for our 
endpoints of 10- and 15-year mortality and also had self-reported comorbidity 
data.
RESULTS: Life expectancy for prostate cancer patients were close to that of a 
typical US man who was 3 years younger. On external validation, 10- and 15-year 
concordance indexes were 0.724 and 0.726, respectively. Our model exhibited 
excellent calibration. Taking into account differences between how comorbidities 
are used in the model versus how they were recorded in the validation cohort, 
calibration would improve for most patients, but there would be overestimation 
of the risk of death in the oldest and sickest patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully created and externally validated a new life 
expectancy prediction model that, while imperfect, has clear advantages to any 
alternative. We urge consideration of its use in counseling patients with 
localized prostate cancer.
