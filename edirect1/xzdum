quality-of-life outcomes and utility-adjusted survival following interventional 
or observational management of BCC.

OBJECTIVES: People often give different weights to quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained by different socioeconomic groups. It is well known that QALY 
gains of younger patients generally get more weight than the same QALY gains 
accruing to older patients. This study aims to separate these age-related 
preferences into "pure age weighting" and age weighting caused by full health 
not perceived as being the same for the old as for the young.
METHODS: We apply a person trade-off method in a large sample representative 
(N = 500) of the Dutch general adult population to estimate age weighting 
factors. We describe health as a percentage of what is considered full health 
for a given age, for which we obtain a proxy in a separate task.
RESULTS: A high amount of age weighting is observed, with QALYs to 20-year-old 
patients receiving approximately 1.5 times as much weight as QALYs to 
80-year-old patients. At the same time, we see that individuals do not perceive 
full health to be the same for young and older people. In fact, the age 
weighting disappears once we control for these differences in full health 
perceptions.
CONCLUSIONS: Respondents had strong preferences for the young relative to the 
old, but these preferences were related to full health perceptions, that is, 
more weight being assigned to younger because full health is at a higher 
absolute level for them than for the old.

With increasing life expectancy and active aging, it becomes crucial to 
investigate methods which could compensate for generally detected cognitive 
aging processes. A promising candidate is adaptive cognitive training, during 
which task difficulty is adjusted to the participants' performance level to 
enhance the training and potential transfer effects. Measuring intrinsic brain 
activity is suitable for detecting possible distributed training-effects since 
resting-state dynamics are linked to the brain's functional flexibility and the 
effectiveness of different cognitive processes. Therefore, we investigated if 
adaptive task-switching training could modulate resting-state neural dynamics in 
younger (18-25 years) and older (60-75 years) adults (79 people altogether). We 
examined spectral power density on resting-state EEG data for measuring 
oscillatory activity, and multiscale entropy for detecting intrinsic neural 
complexity. Decreased coarse timescale entropy and lower frequency band power as 
well as increased fine timescale entropy and higher frequency band power 
revealed a shift from more global to local information processing with aging 
before training. However, cognitive training modulated these age-group 
differences, as coarse timescale entropy and lower frequency band power 
increased from pre- to post-training in the old-training group. Overall, our 
results suggest that cognitive training can modulate neural dynamics even when 
measured outside of the trained task.

This study examined the effects of low-temperature storage on the 
microstructural, absorptive, and digestive properties of cooked rice. Cooked 
rice was refrigerated and stored at 4 °C for 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, as well 
as frozen and preserved at -20, -40, and -80 °C for 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 
28 days. The results indicated that the stored rice samples generally exhibited 
a higher absorption capacity for oil, cholesterol, and glucose than the freshly 
cooked rice. In addition, after storage, the digestibility of the cooked rice 
declined, namely, the rapidly digestible starch (RDS) content and estimated 
glycemic index (eGI) decreased, whereas the slowly digestible starch (SDS) and 
resistant starch (RS) content increased. Moreover, the increment of the storage 
temperatures or the extension of storage periods led to a lower amylolysis 
efficiency. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that storage 
temperature and duration could effectively modify the micromorphology of the 
stored rice samples and their digestion. Moreover, microstructural differences 
after storage and during simulated intestinal digestion could be correlated to 
the variations in the absorption capacity and digestibility. The findings from 
this study will be useful in providing alternative storage procedures to prepare 
rice products with improved nutritional qualities and functional properties.

The combined effect of chitosan coating (CHI) and laurel essential oil (LEO) on 
the shelf-life extension of water buffalo meat stored under aerobic packaging 
conditions at 4 °C was investigated. Microbiological, physicochemical, and 
sensory attributes were monitored over an 18-day storage period. Microbiological 
data indicated that the (CHI) coating along with (LEO) was the most efficient 
among treatments in reducing populations of bacteria by 3.2 log cfu/g on day 6 
of storage (p < 0.05). pH values of meat varied between 6.04 and 6.21, while 
thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values were equal to or less than 2.12 mg 
malondialdehyde/kg throughout storage. The colour parameter L* and a* values 
decreased, while b* values increased during storage (p < 0.05). Taste proved to 
be a more sensitive sensory attribute than odour. Based on sensory and 
microbiological data, product shelf life was approximately 5−6 days for control 
samples, 7−8 days for samples treated with (LEO), 12 days for samples treated 
with (CHI), and 13−14 days for samples treated with (CHI + LEO).

De-Acidification-Induced Increases in Mitochondrial Fragmentation, Mitophagy, 
and Cell Death.

People with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (PLWH) experience high rates of 
HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs); clinical symptoms range from 
being asymptomatic to experiencing HIV-associated dementia. Antiretroviral 
therapies have effectively prolonged the life expectancy related to PLWH; 
however, the prevalence of HANDs has increased. Implicated in the pathogenesis 
of HANDs are two HIV-1 proteins, transactivator of transcription (Tat) and 
gp120; both are neurotoxic and damage mitochondria. The thread-like 
morphological features of functional mitochondria become fragmented when levels 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase, and ROS can be generated via 
Fenton-like chemistry in the presence of ferrous iron (Fe2+). Endolysosomes are 
central to iron trafficking in cells and contain readily releasable Fe2+ stores. 
However, it is unclear whether the endolysosome store is sufficient to account 
for insult-induced increases in levels of ROS, mitochondrial fragmentation, 
autophagy, and cell death. Using U87MG astrocytoma and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma 
cells, we determined that chloroquine (CQ), Tat, and gp120 all (1) de-acidified 
endolysosomes, (2) decreased endolysosome numbers and increased endolysosome 
sizes, (3) increased mitochondrial numbers (fragmentation), (4) increased 
autophagosome numbers, (5) increased autolysosome numbers, (6) increased 
mitochondrial fragments within endolysosomes, and (7) increased cell death. 
These effects were all blocked by the endolysosome-specific iron chelator 
deferoxamine (DFO). Thus, the endolysosome de-acidification-induced release of 
endolysosome Fe2+ is sufficient to account for inter-organellar signaling events 
and cell biology consequences of HIV-1 proteins, including mitochondrial 
fragmentation, autophagy, and cell death.

Pancreatic malignancy is a lethal neoplasm, as well as one of the leading causes 
of cancer-associated mortality, having a 5-year overall survival rate of less 
than 10%. The average life expectancy of patients with advanced pancreatic 
cancer does not exceed six months. Although surgical excision is a favorable 
modality for long-term survival of pancreatic neoplasm, metastasis is initially 
identified in nearly 80% of the patients by the time of diagnosis, making the 
development of therapeutic policy for pancreatic cancer extremely daunting. 
Emerging evidence shows that pancreatic neoplastic cells interact intimately 
with a complicated microenvironment that can foster drug resistance, metastasis, 
or relapse in pancreatic cancer. As a result, the necessity of gaining further 
insight should be focused on the pancreatic microenvironment contributing to 
cancer progression. Numerous evidence reveals that perioperative factors, 
including surgical manipulation and anesthetics (e.g., propofol, volatile 
anesthetics, local anesthetics, epidural anesthesia/analgesia, midazolam), 
analgesics (e.g., opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tramadol), and 
anesthetic adjuvants (such as ketamine and dexmedetomidine), might alter the 
tumor microenvironment and cancer progression by affecting perioperative 
inflammatory or immune responses during cancer surgery. Therefore, the 
anesthesiologist plays an important role in perioperative management and may 
affect surgical outcomes. However, the literature on the impact of anesthesia on 
the pancreatic cancer microenvironment and progression is limited. This review 
summarizes the current knowledge of the implications of anesthesia in the 
pancreatic microenvironment and provides future anesthetic strategies for 
improving pancreatic cancer survival rates.

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. If left untreated, tumors tend to 
grow and spread uncontrolled until the patient dies. To support this growth, 
cancer cells need large amounts of nutrients and growth factors that are 
supplied and distributed to the tumor tissue by the vascular system. The 
aberrant tumor vasculature shows deep morphological, molecular, and metabolic 
differences compared to the blood vessels belonging to the non-malignant tissues 
(also referred as normal). A better understanding of the metabolic mechanisms 
driving the differences between normal and tumor vasculature will allow the 
designing of new drugs with a higher specificity of action and fewer side 
effects to target tumors and improve a patient's life expectancy. In this 
review, we aim to summarize the main features of tumor endothelial cells (TECs) 
and shed light on the critical metabolic pathways that characterize these cells. 
A better understanding of such mechanisms will help to design innovative 
therapeutic strategies in healthy and diseased angiogenesis.

Thirty percent of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
are at least 70 years of age. This number continues to rise as life expectancy 
continues to increase. Still, older adults with HNSCC remain underrepresented in 
clinical trials, resulting in ambiguity on optimal management. Older adults are 
a complex patient population, often requiring increased support due to issues 
relating to functional and performance status, medical comorbidities, and 
medication management. Furthermore, in older adults with HNSCC, many of these 
conditions are independently associated with increased toxicity and worse 
outcomes. Toxicity in the older adult remains difficult to predict and to 
understand, and as treatment decisions are based on treatment tolerability, it 
is essential to understand the toxicities and how to minimize them. Novel 
predictive scores are being developed specifically for older adults with HNSCC 
to understand toxicity and to assist in personalized treatment decisions. There 
are clinical trials presently underway that are investigating shortened 
radiation courses and novel, less toxic systemic treatments in this population. 
In the forthcoming sections, we provide a detailed overview of the clinical 
data, treatment paradigms, and considerations in this population. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of existing clinical data and clinical 
considerations in the older adult head and neck cancer population. Additionally, 
we provide a detailed overview of pertinent current and ongoing clinical trials, 
as well as future areas for investigation.

Background-The recent burden of lip and oral cavity, nasopharynx and other 
pharynx cancer (LOCP) has not been specifically investigated in Europe. 
Methods-In this descriptive epidemiological study, LOCP was categorised into lip 
and oral cavity cancer, nasopharynx cancer and other pharynx cancer, with 
European trends documented using the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD). 
Summary statistics included deaths, age-standardised incidence rates (ASIR), 
mortality rates, YLLs (years of life lost), YLDs (years of life lived with 
disability) and DALYS (disability-adjusted life years). Results-Lip and oral 
cavity cancer (LO) is the most dominant with the incidence decreasing from 6.2 
new cases per 100,000 (95% UI: 6.1-6.4) in 1990 to 5.3 new cases per 100,000 
(95% UI: 4.6-6.1). However, nasopharynx cancer (NP) and other pharynx cancer 
(OP) increased from 1 and 2.2 new cases per 100,000 in 1990 to 1.1 and 3.3 new 
cases per 100,000 in 2019, respectively. It was noted that LOCP YLLs is much 
higher than YLDs. In Europe, eastern European countries, specifically Hungary, 
have the highest burden of LOCP. When LOCP attributable to tobacco in Ireland 
was compared with the EU, the percentage decrease in OP DALYs attributable to 
tobacco is below the EU average, whereas the percentage decrease in LO 
attributable to tobacco in Ireland was above the EU average. Conclusions-There 
has been a significant increase in ASIR in categories other pharynx and 
nasopharynx cancer since 1990, with significant geographic variations.

BACKGROUND: With the aging of populations worldwide, the extension of people's 
working lives has become a crucial policy issue. The aim of this study is to 
assess the impact of complex multimorbidity (CMM) as a predictor of working 
status among retirement-aged adults in Japan.
METHODS: Using a nationwide longitudinal cohort study of people aged over 65 who 
were free of documented disability at baseline, we matched individuals with 
respect to their propensity to develop CMM. The primary outcome of the study was 
working status after the six-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Among 5613 older adults (mean age: 74.2 years) included in the study, 
726 had CMM and 2211 were still working at the end of the follow-up. In 
propensity-matched analyses, the employment rate was 6.4% higher in the CMM-free 
group at the end of the six-year follow-up compared to the CMM group (725 pairs; 
29.5% vs. 35.9%; p = 0.012). Logistic regression analysis showed that CMM 
prevented older people from continuing to work beyond retirement age and was a 
more important factor than socioeconomic factors (income or educational 
attainment) or psychological factors (depressive symptoms or purpose in life).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that CMM has an adverse impact on the employment 
rate of older adults in Japan. This finding suggests that providing appropriate 
support to CMM patients may extend their working lives.

Health needs are common in people living with intellectual disabilities, but we 
do not know how they contribute to life expectancy. We used the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked with hospital/mortality data in England 
(2017-2019) to explore life expectancy among people with or without intellectual 
disabilities, indicated by the presence or absence, respectively, of: epilepsy; 
incontinence; severe visual loss; severe visual impairment; severe mobility 
difficulties; cerebral palsy and PEG feeding. Life expectancy and 95% confidence 
intervals were compared using flexible parametric methods. At baseline, 46.4% 
(total n = 7794) of individuals with intellectual disabilities compared with 
9.7% (total n = 176,807) in the comparison group had ≥1 health need. Epilepsy 
was the most common health need (18.7% vs. 1.1%). All health needs except 
hearing impairment were associated with shorter life expectancy: PEG feeding and 
mobility difficulties were associated with the greatest loss in life years 
(65-68% and 41-44%, respectively). Differential life expectancy attenuated but 
remained (≈12% life years lost) even after restricting the population to those 
without health needs (additional years expected to live at 10 years: 65.5 [60.3, 
71.1] vs. 74.3 [73.8, 74.7]). We conclude that health needs play a significant 
role but do not explain all of the differential life expectancy experienced by 
people with intellectual disabilities.

The network for mental health (NWpG = Netzwerk psychische Gesundheit) is an 
umbrella association for non-medical community mental health care facilities 
across Germany which are enabled to provide multi-professional mental health 
care packages including medical and psychosocial services reimbursed by German 
statutory health insurances since 2009. The aim of this study is to analyse the 
cost-effectiveness of providing NWpG mental health care packages plus treatment 
as usual (NWpG) to treatment as usual alone (TAU) in Germany. In a prospective, 
multicenter, controlled trial over 18 months, a total of 511 patients (NWpG = 
251; TAU = 260) were observed in five regions, four times at six-month 
intervals. The EQ-5D-3L and the Client Sociodemographic and Service Receipt 
Inventory (CSSRI) were used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years and total 
costs of illness. Propensity score-adjusted cost-utility analysis was applied 
using the net benefit approach. No significant differences in costs and QALYs 
between NWpG and TAU groups were identified. The probability of NWpG being 
cost-effective compared to TAU was estimated below 75% for maximum willingness

People with severe mental illness (PSMI) have a shorter life expectancy and are 
more likely to have cardiovascular disease than the general population. 
Patients, carers, psychiatric professionals and primary care providers can all 
play a role in increasing PSMI physical health. The present qualitative 
exploratory study aimed to explore the views of these four populations as part 
of the multi-phase COPsyCAT project, whose objective is to build and test a 
cardiovascular risk prevention programme for PSMI. Overall, 107 people 
participated in the study's 16 focus groups, which were transcribed and analysed 
in a thematic analysis. With a view to building the health promotion programme, 
major themes identified in the corpus were translated into a list of needs as 
follows: communication, information, training and support. Results show that it 
is essential to improve communication between all the different stakeholders in 
mental health. The greatest challenge facing this programme will be to adapt it 
to the needs and expectations of PSMI while facilitating work between the 
various mental health stakeholders. Simple and inexpensive actions could be 
taken to improve the cardiovascular health of PSMI and will be experimented with 
during the programme's feasibility study which will start in September 2022.

Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.

Neurodegenerative diseases are inseparably linked with aging and increase as 
life expectancy extends. There are common dysfunctions in various cellular 
events shared among neurogenerative diseases, such as calcium dyshomeostasis, 
neuroinflammation, and age-associated decline in the autophagy-lysosome system. 
However, most of all, the prominent pathological feature of neurodegenerative 
diseases is the toxic buildup of misfolded protein aggregates and inclusion 
bodies accompanied by an impairment in proteostasis. Recent studies have 
suggested a close association between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and 
neurodegenerative pathology in cellular and animal models as well as in human 
patients. The contribution of mutant or misfolded protein-triggered ER stress 
and its associated signaling events, such as unfolded protein response (UPR), to 
the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative disorders, including 
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, and prion disease, is described here. Impaired UPR action is commonly 
attributed to exacerbated ER stress, pathogenic protein aggregate accumulation, 
and deteriorating neurodegenerative pathologies. Thus, activating certain UPR 
components has been shown to alleviate ER stress and its associated 
neurodegeneration. However, uncontrolled activation of some UPR factors has also 
been demonstrated to worsen neurodegenerative phenotypes, suggesting that 
detailed molecular mechanisms around ER stress and its related 
neurodegenerations should be understood to develop effective therapeutics 
against aging-associated neurological syndromes. We also discuss current 
therapeutic endeavors, such as the development of small molecules that 
selectively target individual UPR components and address ER stress in general.

Riboswitches are regulatory noncoding RNAs found in bacteria, fungi and plants, 
that modulate gene expressions through structural changes in response to ligand 
binding. Understanding how ligands interact with riboswitches in solution can 
shed light on the molecular mechanisms of this ancient regulators. Previous 
studies showed that riboswitches undergo global conformation changes in response 
to ligand binding to relay information. Here, we report conformation switching 
models of the recently discovered tetrahydrofolic acid-responsive second class 
of tetrahydrofolate (THF-II) riboswitches in response to ligand binding. Using a 
combination of selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation, analyzed by primer extension 
(SHAPE) assay, 3D modeling and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we found 
that the ligand specifically recognizes and reshapes the THF-II riboswitch loop 
regions, but does not affect the stability of the P3 helix. Our results show 
that the THF-II riboswitch undergoes only local conformation changes in response 
to ligand binding, rearranging the Loop1-P3-Loop2 region and rotating Loop1 from 
a ~120° angle to a ~75° angle. This distinct conformation changes suggest a 
unique regulatory mechanism of the THF-II riboswitch, previously unseen in other 
riboswitches. Our findings may contribute to the fields of RNA sensors and drug 
design.

Healthy limb joints are important for maintaining health and attaining 
longevity. Endochondral ossification (the replacement of cartilage with bone, 
occurring during skeletal development) is essential for bone formation, 
especially in long-axis bones. In contrast to endochondral ossification, 
chondrocyte populations in articular cartilage persist and maintain joint tissue 
into adulthood. Articular cartilage, a connective tissue consisting of 
chondrocytes and their surrounding extracellular matrices, plays an essential 
role in the mechanical cushioning of joints in postnatal locomotion. 
Osteoarthritis (OA) pathology relates to disruptions in the balance between 
anabolic and catabolic signals, that is, the loss of chondrocyte homeostasis due 
to aging or overuse of cartilages. The onset of OA increases with age, 
shortening a person's healthy life expectancy. Although many people with OA 
experience pain, the mainstay of treatment is symptomatic therapy, and no 
fundamental treatment has yet been established. To establish regenerative or 
preventative therapies for cartilage diseases, further understanding of the 
mechanisms of cartilage development, morphosis, and homeostasis is required. In 
this review, we describe the general development of cartilage and OA pathology, 
followed by a discussion on anabolic and catabolic signals in cartilage 
homeostasis, mainly microRNAs.

The global turn from the linear to the circular economy imposes changes in 
common activities such as food packaging. The use of biodegradable materials 
such as polyvinyl alcohol, natural raw materials such as clays, and food 
byproducts such as chitosan to develop novel food packaging films attracts the 
interest of industrial and institutional research centers. In this study, novel 
hybrid nanostructures were synthesized via the growth of zinc oxide nanorods on 
the surface of two nanoclays. The obtained nanostructures were incorporated with 
chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol composite either as nanoreinforcement or as an active 
agent to develop packaging films. The developed films were characterized via 
XRD, FTIR, mechanical, water-vapor diffusion, water sorption, and oxygen 
permeability measurements. Antimicrobial activity measurements were carried out 
against four different pathogen microorganisms. XRD indicated the formation of 
an intercalated nanocomposite structure for both types of nanoclays. 
Furthermore, improved tensile, water/oxygen barrier, and antimicrobial 
properties were recorded for all films compared to the pure chitosan/polyvinyl 
alcohol film. Overall, the results indicated that the use of the bio-based 
developed films led to an extension of food shelf life and could be used as 
novel active food packaging materials. Among them, the most promising film was 
the 6% wt. ZnO@halloysite.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective treatment for a number of solid 
malignancies. In this work, the antitumor efficacy of photodynamic therapy for 
murine B16 melanoma with intravenous administration of a new photosensitizer 
(PS) based on the chlorin e6 conjugate with a prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA) was studied in vivo. We have previously published the data obtained in 
the first part of the study: the dynamics of PS accumulation in the tumor and 
surrounding tissues and the antitumor efficacy of the photodynamic therapy, 
which was evaluated by the regression parameters and morphological 
characteristics of the tumors-including by the complete regression of the 
tumors, the absolute growth rate of the tumors among the mice with continued 
tumor growth, and an increase in life expectancy compared to the control. The 
criterion for a complete cure was the absence of signs of tumor recurrence 
within 90 days after therapy. The conducted studies demonstrated the high 
efficiency of the new photosensitizer for the photodynamic therapy of B16 
melanoma. This article presents a continuation of this work, including 
histological studies of the zones exposed to laser irradiation on the 21st day 
after treatment and an assessment of the therapeutic potential of photodynamic 
therapy for the destruction of tumor cells. Pathological studies in the zones of 
photodynamic exposure revealed that the effectiveness of the PDT depended on the 
PS dose and the laser irradiation parameters.

Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) have gained popularity in gait analysis and 
human motion tracking, and they provide certain advantages over stationary 
line-of-sight-dependent Optical Motion Capture (OMC) systems. IMUs appear as an 
appropriate alternative solution to reduce dependency on bulky, room-based 
hardware and facilitate the analysis of walking patterns in clinical settings 
and daily life activities. However, most inertial gait analysis methods are 
unpractical in clinical settings due to the necessity of precise sensor 
placement, the need for well-performed calibration movements and poses, and due 
to distorted magnetometer data in indoor environments as well as nearby 
ferromagnetic material and electronic devices. To address these limitations, 
recent literature has proposed methods for self-calibrating magnetometer-free 
inertial motion tracking, and acceptable performance has been achieved in 
mechanical joints and in individuals without neurological disorders. However, 
the performance of such methods has not been validated in clinical settings for 
individuals with neurological disorders, specifically individuals with 
incomplete Spinal Cord Injury (iSCI). In the present study, we used recently 
proposed inertial motion-tracking methods, which avoid magnetometer data and 
leverage kinematic constraints for anatomical calibration. We used these methods 
to determine the range of motion of the Flexion/Extension (F/E) hip and 
Abduction/Adduction (A/A) angles, the F/E knee angles, and the Dorsi/Plantar 
(D/P) flexion ankle joint angles during walking. Data (IMU and OMC) of five 
individuals with no neurological disorders (control group) and five participants 
with iSCI walking for two minutes on a treadmill in a self-paced mode were 
analyzed. For validation purposes, the OMC system was considered as a reference. 
The mean absolute difference (MAD) between calculated range of motion of joint 
angles was 5.00°, 5.02°, 5.26°, and 3.72° for hip F/E, hip A/A, knee F/E, and 
ankle D/P flexion angles, respectively. In addition, relative stance, swing, 
double support phases, and cadence were calculated and validated. The MAD for 
the relative gait phases (stance, swing, and double support) was 1.7%, and the 
average cadence error was 0.09 steps/min. The MAD values for RoM and relative 
gait phases can be considered as clinically acceptable. Therefore, we conclude 
that the proposed methodology is promising, enabling non-restrictive inertial 
gait analysis in clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to estimate the health impact of 
syphilis in the United States in terms of the number of quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) lost attributable to infections in 2018.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model that simulates the natural history and 
management of syphilis. The model was parameterized by sex and sexual 
orientation (women who have sex with men, men who have sex with women [MSW], and 
men who have sex with men [MSM]), and by age at primary infection. We developed 
a separate decision tree model to quantify health losses due to congenital 
syphilis. We estimated the average lifetime number of QALYs lost per infection, 
and the total expected lifetime number of QALYs lost due to syphilis acquired in 
2018.
RESULTS: We estimated the average number of discounted lifetime QALYs lost per 
infection as 0.09 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] .03-.19). The total expected 
number of QALYs lost due to syphilis acquired in 2018 was 13 349 (5071-31 360). 
Although per-case loss was the lowest among MSM (0.06), MSM accounted for 47.7% 
of the overall burden. For each case of congenital syphilis, we estimated 1.79 
(1.43-2.16) and 0.06 (.01-.14) QALYs lost in the child and the mother, 
respectively. We projected 2332 (1871-28 250) and 79 (17-177) QALYs lost for 
children and mothers, respectively, due to congenital syphilis in 2018.
CONCLUSIONS: Syphilis causes substantial health losses in adults and children. 
Quantifying these health losses in terms of QALYs can inform cost-effectiveness 
analyses and can facilitate comparisons of the burden of syphilis to that of 
other diseases.

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of 
idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) in Western Turkey, which encompasses Edirne 
and its surrounding districts.
METHODS: In this study, 9887 individuals, able to communicate and agreed to 
participate in the study, were evaluated. The data was obtained by answering a 
face-to-face questionnaire consisting of 53 questions from volunteers living at 
30 randomly selected family health centers in Edirne and its counties. The 
questionnaire included demographic information, questions to evaluate potential 
concomitant conditions, and questions regarding the symptomatology used in IPD 
diagnosis. Following the questionnaire, it was planned to determine the degree 
of IPD with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Hoehn 
and Yahr scale (HY) clinical rating scale in patients diagnosed with IPD to 
assess disease severity in patients diagnosed with IPD.
RESULTS: Of the 9887 individuals, 118 were diagnosed with IPD according to the 
questionnaire results from Edirne and its districts, and the prevalence of IPD 
was 1.2%. Approximately, 58.4% of the patients with IPD were male and 41.6% were 
female, which was not significantly different (p=0.214). Non-motor symptoms such 
as difficulty urinating, anxiety, depression, fatigue, REM sleep behavior 
disorder, and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep were also examined in 
patients diagnosed with IPD. Depression was identified in 45.7% of the cases, 
while the control group was 4.3% (p=0.001). Fatigue was identified in 46.8% of 
the cases and control group was 3.5% (p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: IPD prevalence studies will increase the awareness in the community 
and provide early diagnosis and treatment as well as serve as a basis to 
increased life expectancy, reduce morbidity, and improve life quality.
