OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate the alcohol-attributable 
disease burden in the Americas in 2000 and 2016.
METHOD: The alcohol-attributable disease burden was estimated using a 
comparative risk assessment approach. Alcohol exposure and relative risk 
estimates were obtained from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Burden of 
disease estimates were obtained from the World Health Organization's Global 
Health Estimates.
RESULTS: In 2016, 372,000 deaths and 18.9 million disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) lost were because of alcohol use in the Americas. The age-standardized 
rates (ASRs) of alcohol-attributable deaths ranged from 16.2 to 54.3 deaths per 
100,000 in Jamaica and Guyana, respectively. From 2000 to 2016, ASRs decreased 
by 12.8% for alcohol-attributable deaths and decreased by 10.8% for 
alcohol-attributable DALYs lost. The decreases in ASRs for alcohol-attributable 
deaths and alcohol-attributable DALYs lost were less than the relative decreases 
in the ASRs for all deaths (18.7%) and all DALYs lost (15.7%). ASRs for 
alcohol-attributable deaths increased in eight countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol continues to be a leading risk factor for the burden of 
disease in the Americas, with the degree and composition of this burden varying 
between countries. Despite a general reduction across the region, in many 
countries the rising alcohol-attributable disease burden constitutes a major 
public health challenge.

BACKGROUND: Apixaban (2.5 mg) taken twice daily has been shown to substantially 
reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with placebo for the 
primary thromboprophylaxis of ambulatory patients with cancer who are starting 
chemotherapy and are at intermediate-to-high risk of VTE. We aimed to compare 
the health system costs and health benefits associated with primary 
thromboprophylaxis using apixaban with those associated with the current 
standard of care (where no primary thromboprophylaxis is given), from the 
perspective of Canada's publicly funded health care system in this subpopulation 
of patients with cancer over a lifetime horizon.
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis to estimate the incremental cost 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with primary thromboprophylaxis 
using apixaban. We obtained baseline event rates and the efficacy of apixaban 
from the Apixaban for the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in High-Risk 
Ambulatory Cancer Patients (AVERT) trial on apixaban prophylaxis. We estimated 
relative risk for bleeding, risk of complications associated with VTE treatment, 
mortality rates, costs and utilities from other published sources.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, apixaban resulted in lower costs to the health 
system (Can$7902.98 v. Can$14 875.82) and an improvement in QALYs (9.089 v. 
9.006). The key driver of cost-effectiveness results was the relative risk of 
VTE as a result of apixaban. Results from the probabilistic analysis showed that 
at a willingness to pay of Can$50 000 per QALY, the strategy with the highest 
probability of being most cost-effective was apixaban, with a probability of 
99.87%.
INTERPRETATION: We found that apixaban is a cost-saving option for the primary 
thromboprophylaxis of ambulatory patients with cancer who are starting 
chemotherapy and are at intermediate-to-high risk of VTE.

The Cost-Effectiveness of Robotic-Assisted Versus Manual Total Knee 
Arthroplasty: A Markov Model-Based Evaluation.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
cost-effectiveness of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) versus 
conventional manual TKA in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
METHODS: A Markov model simulated the lifetime outcomes of TKA of patients at 
average age 60 years. Costs of robotic-assisted TKA included a preoperative CT 
scan and the costs for acquisition and use of robotic equipment (average 
$706,250). We used three institutional case volumes to generate average per-case 
robotic costs: low volume (10 cases, $71,025 per case), mid volume (100 cases, 
$7,463 per case), and high volume (200 cases, $3,931 per case). Systematic 
reviews were used to determine early (≤1 year) and late (> 1 year) revision 
rates after robotic-assisted TKA (0.3 and 0.6%, respectively) and conventional 
TKA (0.78% and 1.5%, respectively). Outcomes were total costs and health 
outcomes measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were 
organized into incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A procedure was 
considered cost-effective if its ICER fell below willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the 
effect of data uncertainty.
RESULTS: Robotic-assisted TKA produced 13.55 QALYs versus 13.29 QALYs for 
conventional TKA. Total costs per case for robotic-assisted TKA were $92,823 
(low volume), $29,261 (mid volume), and $25,730 (high volume) compared with 
$25,113 for conventional. The ICERs for robotic-assisted TKAs were $256,055/QALY 
(low volume), $15,685/QALY (mid volume), and $2,331/QALY (high volume). ICERs 
for mid- and high-volume institutions were below WTP. Average number needed to 
treat was >42 and >24 robotic-assisted TKAs for cost-effectiveness at the 
$50,000 and $100,000/QALY WTP. Robotic-assisted TKAs remained cost-effective 
when annual revision rates <1.6% and quality of life values were >0.85.
CONCLUSION: With lower annualized revision rates and higher postoperative 
quality of life, robotic-assisted TKAs potentially offer improved health 
outcomes, especially when annual institutional case volume >24 cases per year. 
Continued prospective investigation will be crucial to demonstrate the value of 
this new technology.

Let's shape again: the concerted molecular action that builds the pollen tube.

The pollen tube is being subjected to control by a complex network of 
communication that regulates its shape and the misfunction of a single component 
causes specific deformations. In flowering plants, the pollen tube is a tubular 
extension of the pollen grain required for successful sexual reproduction. 
Indeed, maintaining the unique shape of the pollen tube is essential for the 
pollen tube to approach the embryo sac. Many processes and molecules (such as 
GTPase activity, phosphoinositides, Ca2+ gradient, distribution of reactive 
oxygen species and nitric oxide, nonuniform pH values, organization of the 
cytoskeleton, balance between exocytosis and endocytosis, and cell wall 
structure) play key and coordinated roles in maintaining the cylindrical shape 
of pollen tubes. In addition, the above factors must also interact with each 
other so that the cell shape is maintained while the pollen tube follows 
chemical signals in the pistil that guide it to the embryo sac. Any intrinsic 
changes (such as erroneous signals) or extrinsic changes (such as environmental 
stresses) can affect the above factors and thus fertilization by altering the 
tube morphology. In this review, the processes and molecules that enable the 
development and maintenance of the unique shape of pollen tubes in angiosperms 
are presented emphasizing their interaction with specific tube shape. Thus, the 
purpose of the review is to investigate whether specific deformations in pollen 
tubes can help us to better understand the mechanism underlying pollen tube 
shape.

OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness thresholds (CETs) play a particularly important 
role in the reimbursement decisions of health technologies in countries with 
limited healthcare resources. Our goal is to develop a scientifically solid 
proposal for a revised cost-effectiveness threshold, as part of the planned 
review of the Hungarian health economic guidance.
METHODS: The Threshold Working Group of the Hungarian Health Economics 
Association performed a targeted review on CETs in European countries. 
International trends on CETs served as a basis for our recommendation, which was 
discussed at the Association's workshop and deliberated at an expert committee 
meeting with representatives from the national health technology assessment 
(HTA) and healthcare payer bodies, and academic HTA centres.
RESULTS: The current Hungarian CET is one of the highest among European 
countries relative to GDP per capita, and even higher in nominal value than the 
CET applied by NICE. As opposed to the current, single Hungarian threshold, 
other European countries apply multiple thresholds. The Working Group recommends 
that Hungary should also apply multiple CETs in the range of 1.5-3 times GDP per 
capita with stratification according to the relative quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gain of the new technology. In addition, multiple CETs in the range of 
3-10 times GDP per capita is recommended for technologies in rare diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: CETs should be aligned with the country's economic performance and 
should reflect societal preferences. Our recommendation may increase the 
efficiency of healthcare resource allocation in Hungary by strengthening the 
role of HTA in the reimbursement decisions and favouring new technologies with 
higher QALY gain.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report the level and trends of 13 
cancers that are attributable to excess body weight (EBW) for 204 countries and 
territories from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Using publicly available data, the burden of cancers attributable to 
EBW was reported from 1990 to 2019 based on the comparative risk assessment 
approach used in the Global Burden of Disease study 2019. [Correction added on 
27 January 2022, after first online publication: 'Using publicly available 
data,' has been added before the first sentence and 'estimated' was corrected to 
'reported'.] RESULTS: In 2019, EBW caused 11.2 million disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), or 4.4% of all cancer-related DALYs. Between 1990 and 2019, 
the global EBW-attributable age-standardized cancer DALY rates (per 100,000) 
increased from 109.9 to 133.9, a relative increase of 21.9%. The 
age-standardized DALY rates (per 100,000) of cancers attributable to EBW in 2019 
were highest and lowest in Mongolia (611.8) and Bangladesh (30.2), respectively. 
The 60- to 64-year age group had the highest number of DALYs attributable to 
EBW, whereas there were no large sex differences in the cancer-related burden 
attributable to EBW. Furthermore, the association between the age-standardized 
DALY rates and the sociodemographic index was generally positive.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the EBW-attributable burden of cancers has increased in 
the past three decades. Public health efforts should focus on identifying 
appropriate preventive interventions at the population and individual levels, 
especially in the regions and countries with the highest burden.

PURPOSE: To update recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO)-Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario [CCO]) adjuvant bone-modifying agents 
in breast cancer guideline.
METHODS: An Expert Panel conducted a systematic review to identify new, 
potentially practice-changing data.
RESULTS: Four articles met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis 
for revision of the previous recommendations.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy should be discussed with all 
postmenopausal patients (natural or therapy-induced) with primary breast cancer, 
irrespective of hormone receptor status and human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 status, who are candidates to receive adjuvant systemic therapy. 
Adjuvant bisphosphonates, if used, are not substitutes for standard anticancer 
modalities. The benefit of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy will vary depending 
on the underlying risk of recurrence and is associated with a modest improvement 
in overall survival. The NHS PREDICT tool provides estimates of the benefit of 
adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy and may aid in decision making. Factors 
influencing the decision to recommend adjuvant bisphosphonate use should include 
patients' risk of recurrence, risk of side effects, financial toxicity, drug 
availability, patient preferences, comorbidities, and life expectancy. When an 
adjuvant bisphosphonate is used to prevent breast cancer recurrence, the 
therapeutic options recommended by the Panel include oral clodronate, oral 
ibandronate, and intravenous zoledronic acid. The Panel supports starting 
bisphosphonate therapy early, consistent with the points outlined in the parent 
CCO-ASCO guideline; this is a consensus recommendation. The Panel does not 
recommend adjuvant denosumab to prevent breast cancer recurrence, because 
studies did not show a consistent reduction of breast cancer recurrence in any 
subset of those with early-stage breast cancer.Additional information can be 
found at www.asco.org/breast-cancer-guideline.

California, San Diego, California, USA.

INTRODUCTION: In recent decades, life expectancy has increased considerably. The 
cardiovascular effects of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in the elderly lead to 
patient disability and high resource consumption. Intermittent nocturnal hypoxia 
leads to hemodynamic stress and adrenergic activation, which promotes 
cardiovascular disease. However, chronic intermittent hypoxia may protect 
elderly patients from cardiovascular events (CVE) due to biological adaptation.
AREAS COVERED: OSA patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. The 
severity of OSA increases cardiovascular risk, and this association also exists 
in the elderly. This article reviews the association between OSA, CPAP 
treatment, and CVE, particularly stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD), in the 
elderly. MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration databases were searched from 
inception to July 2021.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: Although a positive association between OSA and the incidence 
of cardiovascular disease in the elderly has been established, the role of sleep 
apnea in certain cardiovascular events remains controversial. Most authors agree 
that untreated OSA is a risk factor for stroke or worse stroke prognosis. 
However, the association between OSA and CHD is usually less pronounced than 
between OSA and stroke, especially in the elderly.

PURPOSE: Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SpVT) in solid tumors has not been well 
investigated. Therefore, the treatment guidelines for SpVT are not well 
established. We aimed to conduct this prospective study to investigate the 
clinical characteristics and risk factors influencing survival in patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer with SpVT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with gastrointestinal cancer diagnosed 
with SpVT were prospectively enrolled. The clinical characteristics and courses 
of SpVT were analyzed.
RESULTS: SpVT occurred in various clinical situations (at the time of initial 
cancer diagnosis or tumor recurrence after curative therapy, in the 
postoperative period, during chemotherapy, or in the period of end-of-life 
care). Among the total patients, 90.2% had no SpVT-related symptoms at initial 
SpVT diagnosis, and 82.4% did not receive any anticoagulation therapy. The 
clinical course of SpVT during the follow-up varied: (1) spontaneous resorption 
without any anticoagulation (47.1%), (2) resorption with anticoagulation (3.9%), 
(3) persistent thrombosis without progression (17.6%), and (4) SpVT extension 
(31.4%). Although the SpVT showed extension in some cases, most of them did not 
cause symptoms or had little impact on the patient's cancer treatment course. 
During the follow-up period, 23 patients died, all of which were caused by tumor 
progression. In the multivariable analysis, performance status and clinical 
situation at the time of SpVT diagnosis were significant prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians could adopt a strategy of close observation for 
incidentally detected SpVT in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. 
Anticoagulation should be considered only for SpVT cases selected strictly, 
weighing the risks and benefits.

Using Relapse Prevention Interventions to Maintain Remission and Minimize 
Relapse Rates for Individuals With Schizophrenia: A Scoping Review.

Abu Sabra MA, Hamdan-Mansour AM.

Maintaining remission and improving quality of life for individuals with 
schizophrenia can encourage them to return to work, participate in volunteer 
opportunities, and establish healthy intimate relationships. The purpose of the 
current review was to explore the impacts of using relapse prevention 
interventions on maintaining remission and minimizing relapse rate for 
individuals with schizophrenia. A scoping review was performed using the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for 
Scoping Reviews guidelines to screen 134 studies published between 2010 and 
2020. A total of 14 articles met eligibility criteria. Included studies showed 
that intervention strategies tailored to meet the needs of individuals with 
schizophrenia must be developed and applied in different psychiatric settings to 
maintain remission and minimize relapse rate. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing

Antibiotics are widely supplied over all the world to animals and humans to 
fight and heal bacteriological diseases. The uptake of antibiotics has largely 
increased the average-life expectancy of living beings. However, these 
recalcitrant products have been detected at low concentrations in natural 
waters, with potential health risks due to alterations in food chains and an 
increase in the resistance to bacterial infection, control of infectious 
diseases, and damage of the beneficial bacteria. The high stability of 
antibiotics at mild conditions prevents their effective removal in conventional 
wastewater treatment plants. A powerful advanced oxidation processes such as the 
electro-Fenton (EF) process is being developed as a guarantee for their 
destruction by •OH generated as strong oxidant. This review presents a critical, 
exhaustive, and detailed analysis on the application of EF to remediate 
synthetic and real wastewaters contaminated with common antibiotics, covering 
the period 2017-2021. Homogeneous EF and heterogeneous EF involving iron solid 
catalysts or iron functionalized cathodes, as well as their hybrid and 
sequential treatments, are exhaustively examined. Their fundamentals and 
characteristics are detailed, and the main results obtained for the removal of 
the most used antibiotic families are carefully described and discussed. The 
role of generated oxidizing agents is explained, and the by-products generated, 
and reaction sequences proposed are detailed.

Over the last decades, permanent crating of farrowing and lactating sows has led 
to serious public concerns with regard to sow welfare. As one alternative, it 
has been suggested to restrict crating to the period when suckling piglets are 
at the highest risk to die. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate 
live-born piglet mortality with regard to different confinement periods (CFP) as 
well as farrowing pen types. On three research farms (A, B and C), four 
confinement periods were compared: In CFP 0 (control), sows were not confined at 
all, sows in CFP 3 were crated after the end of farrowing for three days. In CFP 
4, sows were confined one day before the due date of farrowing until three days 
after parturition and sows in CFP 6 were crated one day before expected 
farrowing until five days after parturition. Furthermore, five different pen 
types designed for temporary crating (PT; 5.5-7.3 m2) were compared. In total, 
production data from 638 litters were analysed. For each piglet found dead 
(n = 1 580), the cause of death was determined by the farm personnel and 
verified by necropsy (all three farms) and additional video analysis (farms A 
and B only). Data were analysed using logistic mixed models with CFP 0 and pen 
type Fluegel as reference categories (CFP 0 was control and this pen type was 
present on all three farms and the largest number of litters was born in this 
pen type). Live-born piglet mortality was lower in temporarily crated sows than 
in sows without confinement (CFP 0; P < 0.015). Pairwise posthoc tests did not 
reveal differences between CFP 3, CFP 4 and CFP 6 (odds ratios 0.75, 0.59 and 
0.69), nor between pen types. Additional factors associated with increasing 
live-born piglet mortality were larger litter size, higher sow parity as well as 
the administration of hormones around farrowing. Factors influencing mortality 
due to crushing were similar to those for total live-born mortality with the 
exception of CFP 3 not differing significantly from CFP 0. It can be concluded, 
that confinement of the sow for three days after farrowing is an effective 
measure to reduce live-born piglet mortality in the pen types tested. An 
extension of the confinement period to five days after parturition does not 
result in a further reduction of live-born mortality rate.

Autosomal recessive mutations in the PINK1 gene are causal for Parkinson's 
disease (PD). PINK1 encodes a mitochondrial localized protein kinase that is a 
master-regulator of mitochondrial quality control pathways. Structural studies 
to date have elaborated the mechanism of how mutations located within the kinase 
domain disrupt PINK1 function; however, the molecular mechanism of PINK1 
mutations located upstream and downstream of the kinase domain is unknown. We 
have employed mutagenesis studies to define the minimal region of human PINK1 
required for optimal ubiquitin phosphorylation, beginning at residue Ile111. 
Inspection of the AlphaFold human PINK1 structure model predicts a conserved 
N-terminal α-helical extension (NTE) domain forming an intramolecular 
interaction with the C-terminal extension (CTE), which we corroborate using 
hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry of recombinant insect PINK1 
protein. Cell-based analysis of human PINK1 reveals that PD-associated mutations 
(e.g. Q126P), located within the NTE : CTE interface, markedly inhibit 
stabilization of PINK1; autophosphorylation at Serine228 (Ser228) and Ubiquitin 
Serine65 (Ser65) phosphorylation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that NTE and 
CTE domain mutants disrupt PINK1 stabilization at the mitochondrial Translocase 
of outer membrane complex. The clinical relevance of our findings is supported 
by the demonstration of defective stabilization and activation of endogenous 
PINK1 in human fibroblasts of a patient with early-onset PD due to homozygous 
PINK1 Q126P mutations. Overall, we define a functional role of the NTE : CTE 
interface towards PINK1 stabilization and activation and show that loss of NTE : 
CTE interactions is a major mechanism of PINK1-associated mutations linked to 
PD.

INTRODUCTION: Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for several types of cancer. 
Alcohol consumption levels in Argentina are among the highest in the world, and 
malignant neoplasms are the second cause of death in the country. Public health 
strategies aimed at reducing alcohol consumption could possibly lead to a 
decrease in cancer burden. Alcohol-attributable burden has been estimated before 
in neighboring countries Chile and Brazil. We now aimed to quantify the burden 
for Argentina.
METHODS: We obtained data on alcohol consumption levels from a national 
representative health survey and etiologic effect sizes for the association 
between alcohol and cancer from the most recent comprehensive meta-analysis. We 
estimated the number of alcohol-attributable cancer-related deaths and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), stratified by consumption level (light 
(0.1-12.5 g/day), moderate (12.6-50 g/day), or heavy (> 50 g/day) drinking). We 
additionally explored which hypothetical scenario would achieve the highest 
reduction in alcohol-attributable cancer burden: 1) heavy drinkers shifting to 
moderate drinking or 2) moderate drinkers shifting to light drinking.
RESULTS: In 2018, 53% of the Argentinean population consumed alcohol. In men 
3.7% of all cancer deaths and DALYs were attributable to alcohol consumption, in 
women this was 0.8% of all cancer deaths and DALYs. When moderate drinkers would 
shift to light drinking, 46% of alcohol-attributable cancer deaths and DALYs 
would be prevented, opposed to only 24% when heavy drinkers would shift to 
moderate drinking.
CONCLUSION: Most cancer deaths and DALYs were attributable to moderate alcohol 
consumption (50%). This calls for implementation of population-wide 
strategies-instead of targeting heavy drinking only-to effectively reduce 
harmful use of alcohol and its impact on disease burden.

BACKGROUND: The immunotherapy with immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICI) has 
changed the life expectancy in metastatic melanoma (MM) patients. Nevertheless, 
several patients do not respond hence, the identification and validation of 
novel biomarkers of response to ICI is of crucial importance. Circulating 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as PD-L1+ EV mediate resistance to anti-PD1, 
instead the role of PD1+ EV is not fully understood.
METHODS: We isolated the circulating EVs from the plasma of an observational 
cohort study of 71 metastatic melanoma patients and correlated the amount of 
PD-L1+ EVs and PD1+ EVs with the response to ICI. The analysis was performed 
according to the origin of EVs from the tumor and the immune cells. 
Subsequently, we analysed the data in a validation cohort of 22 MM patients to 
assess the reliability of identified EV-based biomarkers. Additionally we 
assessed the involvement of PD1+ EVs in the seizure of nivolumab and in the 
perturbation of immune cells-mediated killing of melanoma spheroids.
RESULTS: The level of PD-L1+ EVs released from melanoma and CD8+ T cells and 
that of PD1+ EVs irrespective of the cellular origin were higher in 
non-responders. The Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that higher levels of PD1+ EVs 
were significantly correlated with poorer progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS). Significant correlations were found for PD-L1+ EVs only 
when released from melanoma and T cells. The multivariate analysis showed that 
high level of PD1+ EVs, from T cells and B cells, and high level of PD-L1+ EVs 
from melanoma cells, are independent biomarkers of response. The reliability of 
PD-L1+ EVs from melanoma and PD1+ EVs from T cells in predicting PFS was 
confirmed in the validation cohort through the univariate Cox-hazard regression 
analysis. Moreover we discovered that the circulating EVs captured nivolumab and 
reduced the T cells trafficking and tumor spheroids killing.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified circulating PD1+ EVs as driver of resistance to 
anti-PD1, and highlighted that the analysis of single EV population by liquid 
biopsy is a promising tool to stratify MM patients for immunotherapy.

INTRODUCTION: Due to the increased use of CT and MRI, the prevalence of 
incidental findings on brain scans is increasing. Meningioma, the most common 
primary brain tumour, is a frequently encountered incidental finding, with an 
estimated prevalence of 3/1000. The management of incidental meningioma varies 
widely with active clinical-radiological monitoring being the most accepted 
method by clinicians. Duration of monitoring and time intervals for assessment, 
however, are not well defined. To this end, we have recently developed a 
statistical model of progression risk based on single-centre retrospective data. 
The model Incidental Meningioma: Prognostic Analysis Using Patient Comorbidity 
and MRI Tests (IMPACT) employs baseline clinical and imaging features to 
categorise the patient with an incidental meningioma into one of three risk 
groups: low, medium and high risk with a proposed active monitoring strategy 
based on the risk and temporal trajectory of progression, accounting for 
actuarial life expectancy. The primary aim of this study is to assess the 
external validity of this model.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: IMPACT is a retrospective multicentre study which will aim 
to include 1500 patients with an incidental intracranial meningioma, powered to 
detect a 10% progression risk. Adult patients ≥16 years diagnosed with an 
incidental meningioma between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010 will be 
included. Clinical and radiological data will be collected longitudinally until 
the patient reaches one of the study endpoints: intervention (surgery, 
stereotactic radiosurgery or fractionated radiotherapy), mortality or last date 
of follow-up. Data will be uploaded to an online Research Electronic Data 
Capture database with no unique identifiers. External validity of IMPACT will be 
tested using established statistical methods.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Local institutional approval at each participating 
centre will be required. Results of the study will be reported through 
peer-reviewed articles and conferences and disseminated to participating 
centres, patients and the public using social media.
