(OMIM 175100), tuberous sclerosis (OMIM 191100) and Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome 
(OMIM 135150). Timely diagnosis of these syndromes is essential for entry into 
appropriate screening protocols, which have been shown to effectively prolong 
life expectancy in these cohorts of patients.

Unexplored electrochemical behavior of abiraterone, a recent and widely used 
prostate cancer drug, in interaction with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme 
and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is investigated in this work. The 
results reported in this work are significant for personalized medicine and 
point-of-care chemical treatment, especially to improve the life expectancy and 
quality of life of patients with prostate-cancer. To this purpose, enzymatic and 
nonenzymatic electrochemical biosensors were developed and characterized with 
different concentrations of abiraterone. Nonenzymatic biosensors were 
functionalized with MWCNTs as a catalyst for signal enhancement, while enzymatic 
biosensors have been obtained with CYP3A4 protein immobilized on MWCNTs as 
recognition biomolecule. Enzymatic electrochemical experiments demonstrated an 
inhibition effect on the CYP3A4, clearly observed as a diminished 
electrocatalytic activity of the enzyme. Electrochemical responses of 
nonenzymatic biosensors clearly demonstrated the direct electroactivity of 
abiraterone when reacting with MWCNT as well as an electrode-fouling effect.

This Guideline is an official statement of the European Society of 
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), endorsed by the European Society for 
Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), the European Society of Digestive Endoscopy 
(ESDO), and the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN). 
The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) 
system was adopted to define the strength of recommendations and the quality of 
evidence. Main recommendations for malignant disease 1 ESGE recommends placement 
of partially or fully covered self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs) for 
palliative treatment of malignant dysphagia over laser therapy, photodynamic 
therapy, and esophageal bypass (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). 2 
For patients with longer life expectancy, ESGE recommends brachytherapy as a 
valid alternative or in addition to stenting in esophageal cancer patients with 
malignant dysphagia. Brachytherapy may provide a survival advantage and possibly 
a better quality of life compared to SEMS placement alone. (Strong 
recommendation, high quality evidence.) 3 ESGE recommends esophageal SEMS 
placement as the preferred treatment for sealing malignant tracheoesophageal or 
bronchoesophageal fistula (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 4 ESGE 
does not recommend the use of concurrent external radiotherapy and esophageal 
stent treatment. SEMS placement is also not recommended as a bridge to surgery 
or prior to preoperative chemoradiotherapy. It is associated with a high 
incidence of adverse events and alternative satisfactory options such as 
placement of a feeding tube are available. (Strong recommendation, low quality 
evidence.) Main recommendations for benign disease 1 ESGE recommends against the 
use of self-expandable stents (SEMSs) as first-line therapy for the management 
of benign esophageal strictures because of the potential for adverse events, the 
availability of alternative therapies, and costs (strong recommendation, low 
quality evidence). 2 ESGE suggests consideration of temporary placement of SEMSs 
as therapy for refractory benign esophageal strictures (weak recommendation, 
moderate evidence). Stents should usually be removed at a maximum of 3 months 
(strong recommendation, weak quality evidence). 3 ESGE suggests that fully 
covered SEMSs be preferred over partially covered SEMSs for the treatment of 
refractory benign esophageal strictures, because of their lack of embedment and 
ease of removability (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). 4 For the 
removal of partially covered esophageal SEMSs that are embedded, ESGE recommends 
the stent-in-stent technique (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 5 
ESGE recommends that temporary stent placement can be considered for treating 
esophageal leaks, fistulas, and perforations. The optimal stenting duration 
remains unclear and should be individualized. (Strong recommendation, low 
quality evidence.) 6 ESGE recommends placement of a SEMS for the treatment of 
esophageal variceal bleeding refractory to medical, endoscopic, and/or 
radiological therapy, or as initial therapy for patients with massive esophageal 
variceal bleeding (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

The initiation of replication is an extremely important process in DNA life 
cycle. Given an uncharacterized DNA sequence, can we identify where its origin 
of replication (ORI) is located? It is no doubt a fundamental problem in genome 
analysis. Particularly, with the rapid development of genome sequencing 
technology that results in a huge amount of sequence data, it is highly desired 
to develop computational methods for rapidly and effectively identifying the 
ORIs in these genomes. Unfortunately, by means of the existing computational 
methods, such as sequence alignment or kmer strategies, it could hardly achieve 
decent success rates. To address this problem, we developed a predictor called 
"iOri-Human". Rigorous jackknife tests have shown that its overall accuracy and 
stability in identifying human ORIs are over 75% and 50%, respectively. In the 
predictor, it is through the pseudo nucleotide composition (an extension of 
pseudo amino acid composition) that 96 physicochemical properties for the 16 
possible constituent dinucleotides have been incorporated to reflect the global 
sequence patterns in DNA as well as its local sequence patterns. Moreover, a 
user-friendly web-server for iOri-Human has been established at 
http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iOri-Human.html, by which users can easily get 
their desired results without the need to through the complicated mathematics 
involved.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of limitations to Advanced Life Support in 
critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit with integrated 
palliative care.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients in the palliative 
care program of the intensive care unit of Hospital Paulistano over 18 years of 
age from May 1, 2011, to January 31, 2014. The limitations to Advanced Life 
Support that were analyzed included do-not-resuscitate orders, mechanical 
ventilation, dialysis and vasoactive drugs. Central tendency measures were 
calculated for quantitative variables. The chi-squared test was used to compare 
the characteristics of patients with or without limits to Advanced Life Support, 
and the Wilcoxon test was used to compare length of stay after Advanced Life 
Support. Confidence intervals reflecting p ≤ 0.05 were considered for 
statistical significance.
RESULTS: A total of 3,487 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, of 
whom 342 were included in the palliative care program. It was observed that 
after entering the palliative care program, it took a median of 2 (1 - 4) days 
for death to occur in the intensive care unit and 4 (2 - 11) days for hospital 
death to occur. Many of the limitations to Advanced Life Support (42.7%) took 
place on the first day of hospitalization. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (96.8%) 
and ventilatory support (73.6%) were the most adopted limitations.
CONCLUSION: The contribution of palliative care integrated into the intensive 
care unit was important for the practice of orthothanasia, i.e., the 
non-extension of the life of a critically ill patient by artificial means.

OBJETIVO: Estimar a incidência de limitação de Suporte Avançado de Vida em 
pacientes graves internados em unidade de terapia intensiva com cuidados 
paliativos integrados.
MÉTODOS: Estudo de coorte retrospectivo, no qual foram incluídos os pacientes 
inseridos no programa de cuidados paliativos da unidade de terapia intensiva do 
Hospital Paulistano, maiores de 18 anos de idade, no período de 1º de maio de 
2011 a 31 de janeiro de 2014. As limitações de Suporte Avançado de Vida 
analisadas foram: ordem para não ressuscitar, ventilação mecânica, hemodiálise e 
droga vasoativa. Para as variáveis quantitativas, foram calculadas medidas de 
tendência central. O teste qui quadrado foi utilizado para comparar 
características dos pacientes com ou sem limitação de Suporte Avançado de Vida e 
teste de Wilcoxon, para comparar o tempo de internação após Suporte Avançado de 
Vida. Para significância estatística, consideraram-se o intervalo de confiança e 
p ≤ 0,05.
RESULTADOS: Foram internados na unidade de terapia intensiva 3.487 pacientes, 
sendo 342 inseridos no programa de cuidados paliativos. Observou-se que, após 
entrada no programa de cuidados paliativos, demorou uma mediana de 2 (1 - 4) 
dias para o óbito na unidade de terapia intensiva e 4 (2 - 11) dias para óbito 
hospitalar. Boa parte das limitações de Suporte Avançado de Vida (42,7%) 
aconteceu no primeiro dia de internação. A ressuscitação cardiopulmonar (96,8%) 
e o suporte ventilatório (73,6%) foram as limitações mais adotadas.
CONCLUSÃO: Foi relevante a contribuição dos cuidados paliativos integrados à 
unidade de terapia intensiva para a prática da ortotanásia, ou seja, o não 
prolongamento da vida de um paciente terminal por meios artificiais.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2i (LGMD2i) affects thousands of lives with 
shortened life expectancy mainly due to cardiac and respiratory problems and 
difficulty with ambulation significantly compromising quality of life. Limited 
studies have noted impaired gait in patients and animal models of different 
muscular dystrophies, but not in animal models of LGMD2i. Our goal, therefore, 
was to quantify gait metrics in the fukutin-related protein P448L mutant (P448L) 
mouse, a recently developed model for LGMD2i. The Noldus CatWalk XT motion 
capture system was used to identify multiple gait impairments. An average 
galloping body speed of 35 cm/s for both P448L and C57BL/6 wild-type mice was 
maintained to ensure differences in gait were due only to strain physiology. 
Compared to wild-type mice, P448L mice reach maximum contact 10% faster and have 
40% more paw surface area during stance. Additionally, force intensity at the 
time of maximum paw contact is roughly 2-fold higher in P448L mice. Paw swing 
time is reduced in P448L mice without changes in stride length as a faster swing 
speed compensates. Gait instability in P448L mice is indicated by 50% higher 
instances of 3 and 4 paw stance support and conversely, 2-fold fewer instances 
of single paw stance support and no instance of zero paw support. This leads to 
lower variation of normal step patterns used and a higher use of uncommon step 
patterns. Similar anomalies have also been noted in muscular dystrophy patients 
due to weakness in the hip abductor muscles, producing a Trendelenburg gait 
characterized by "waddling" and more pronounced shifts to the stance leg. Thus, 
gait of P448L mice replicates anomalies commonly seen in LGMD2i patients, which 
is not only potentially valuable for assessing drug efficacy in restoring 
movement biomechanics, but also for better understanding them.

BACKGROUND: To investigate dietary habits among young people in the 
Mediterranean lands, exactly where the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet 
(MD) were discovered by Ancel Keys.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design.
METHODS: A 10-items food-frequency questionnaire was administered to 1117 
students in the schools of the Cilento area. Adherence to the MD was appraised 
according to a scale of 0-10. A logistic regression model was used to identify 
possible factors associated with "Following an unhealthy diet". Results were 
expressed as Odds Ratio with 95% confidence interval and the level of 
significance was set at p<0.05.
RESULTS: A percentage of 63.8 reached a score under six, indicating that the 
majority of the students did not respect the rules of the Mediterranean diet and 
only 36.2% (n. 371) exceeded a score of 6 adhering to it in varying degrees. At 
the logistic regression analysis smokers resulted to be affected by almost a 
double risk of getting away from the Mediterranean dietary pattern (OR = 1.93; 
CI 95% 1.44-2.57); on the contrary, those with a higher PCS12 (Physical 
Component Summary score) were in a lower risk to move away from the MD style (OR 
= 0.98; 95% CI = 0.96-0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its increasing popularity worldwide, adherence to the MD 
model is decreasing. The new generation of young people does not adhere to the 
MD pattern although they live in the lands characterized by the tradition and 
culture of healthy diet and where the benefits from this pattern were initially 
discovered. Interventions and specific education about the healthy diet may be 
useful to recover student's dietary patterns as in the old eating tradition.

IMPORTANCE: Among high-risk patients with hypertension, targeting a systolic 
blood pressure of 120 mm Hg reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
compared with a higher target. However, intensive blood pressure management 
incurs additional costs from treatment and from adverse events.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of intensive blood 
pressure management compared with standard management.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cost-effectiveness analysis conducted 
from September 2015 to August 2016 used a Markov cohort model to estimate 
cost-effectiveness of intensive blood pressure management among 68-year-old 
high-risk adults with hypertension but not diabetes. We used the Systolic Blood 
Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) to estimate treatment effects and adverse 
event rates. We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Life Tables to 
project age- and cause-specific mortality, calibrated to rates reported in 
SPRINT. We also used population-based observational data to model development of 
heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and subsequent mortality. Costs 
were based on published sources, Medicare data, and the National Inpatient 
Sample.
INTERVENTIONS: Treatment of hypertension to a systolic blood pressure goal of 
120 mm Hg (intensive management) or 140 mm Hg (standard management).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), discounted at 3% annually.
RESULTS: Standard management yielded 9.6 QALYs and accrued $155 261 in lifetime 
costs, while intensive management yielded 10.5 QALYs and accrued $176 584 in 
costs. Intensive blood pressure management cost $23 777 per QALY gained. In a 
sensitivity analysis, serious adverse events would need to occur at 3 times the 
rate observed in SPRINT and be 3 times more common in the intensive management 
arm to prefer standard management.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intensive blood pressure management is cost-effective 
at typical thresholds for value in health care and remains so even with 
substantially higher adverse event rates.

IMPORTANCE: Because of the similarity in clinical outcomes after elective open 
and endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), cost may be an 
important factor in choosing a procedure.
OBJECTIVE: To compare total and AAA-related use of health care services, costs, 
and cost-effectiveness between groups randomized to open or endovascular repair.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This unblinded randomized clinical trial 
enrolled 881 patients undergoing planned elective repair of AAA who were 
candidates for open and endovascular repair procedures. Patients were randomized 
from October 15, 2002, to April 15, 2008, at 42 Veterans Affairs medical 
centers. Follow-up was completed on October 15, 2011, and data were analyzed 
from April 15, 2013, to April 15, 2016, based on intention to treat.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean total and AAA-related health care cost per 
life-year and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: A total of 881 patients (876 men [99.4%]; 5 women [0.6%]; mean [SD] 
age, 70 [7.8] years) were included in the analysis. After a mean of 5.2 years of 
follow-up, mean life-years were 4.89 in the endovascular group and 4.84 in the 
open repair group (P = .68), and mean QALYs were 3.72 in the endovascular group 
and 3.70 in the open repair group (P = .82). Total mean health care costs did 
not differ significantly between the 2 groups (endovascular group, $142 745; 
open repair group, $153 533; difference, -$10 788; 95% CI, -$29 796 to $5825; 
P = .25). Costs related to AAA, including the initial repair, constituted nearly 
40% of total costs and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups 
(endovascular group, $57 501; open repair group, $57 893; difference, -$393; 95% 
CI, -$12 071 to $7928; P = .94). Lower costs due to shorter hospitalization for 
initial endovascular repair were offset by increased costs from AAA-related 
secondary procedures and imaging studies. The probability of endovascular repair 
being less costly and more effective was 56.8% when effectiveness was measured 
in life-years and 55.4% when effectiveness was measured in QALYs for total costs 
and 31.3% and 34.3%, respectively, for AAA-related costs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicenter randomized clinical trial with 
follow-up to 9 years, survival, quality of life, costs, and cost-effectiveness 
did not differ between elective open and endovascular repair of AAA.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the potential economic benefits of closing the 
Indigenous health gap by quantifying the economic burden associated with 
Indigenous health inequality in the Northern Territory.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cost-of-illness study was conducted from a 
societal perspective for NT residents for the period 2009-2013. The total cost 
of the Indigenous health gap was estimated by calculating the cost differences 
between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in health services, lost 
productivity and lost life-years on the basis of data from the 2011 census, as 
well as on burden of disease, health expenditure, welfare, taxation and other 
published financial data.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The total and per capita costs in three categories were 
analysed: direct health costs, the indirect costs of lost productivity, and 
intangible costs associated with premature deaths.
RESULTS: The excess cost of the Indigenous health gap was estimated to be $16.7 
billion for the 5-year study period, equivalent to 19% of the NT gross state 
product. The excess costs associated with the Indigenous health gap included 22% 
caused by higher health expenditure for servicing the gap, 35% attributable to 
lost productivity caused by illness, and 43% associated with lost life-years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the long term potential benefits of the 
Australian governments' Closing the Gap initiative for the NT. Successful 
implementation of this initiative will require improving government services by 
combating discrimination, developing local economies, overcoming poverty, and 
reducing the disadvantages associated with remoteness.

Spinal metastases are a common and morbid condition in America. Of the 1.6 
million new cases of cancer estimated to be diagnosed in the USA in 2015, 
approximately 5-10 % will develop spinal metastases. This number is expected to 
increase as the life expectancy of cancer patients increases. Patients with 
osteolytic spinal metastases experience severe and often debilitating pain, 
which significantly reduces quality of life. Due to the morbidity of open 
surgery, particularly in oncologic patients, the treatment paradigm has shifted 
towards minimally invasive therapy. The advent and evolution of percutaneous 
treatments of spinal metastases has shown progressive success in reducing pain, 
improving function, and providing mechanical stability. There are various 
currently available interventions including vertebroplasty, vertebral 
augmentation, and coblation and radiofrequency ablation systems. For more 
complex spinal metastases, combined treatments including vertebral augmentation 
in conjunction with radiofrequency ablation, external beam radiation, and the 
novel treatment of intraoperative radiotherapy are also available. Ultimately, 
the goal of treatment in this patient population is palliative with the 
intention of improving the remaining quality of life. There is no established 
algorithm or specific technique that has proved best for the many variations of 
vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), so treatment tends to be dependent on 
the operator and/or based on institution preference or bias. Each technique 
provides its own unique value in the various types of metastatic VCFs 
encountered, and understanding the uses, advantages, and safety profile of each 
specific treatment is imperative in providing the best patient care. 
Percutaneous treatment of metastatic spinal disease is an excellent alternative 
to medical and surgical management in carefully selected patients. We believe 
that a multidisciplinary approach and combination therapy allows for optimal 
pain reduction and improvement of function.

Why Gametes are not Like Enriched Uranium.

Botterell A(1).

Comment on
    Bioethics. 2008 Mar;22(3):166-78.

According to Rivka Weinberg, gametes are like enriched uranium: both are 
hazardous materials. Exposing human beings to enriched uranium can result in 
radioactivity and decreased life expectancy, while exposing sperm and ova to 
each other can result in the creation of needy innocent persons with full moral 
status. Weinberg argues that when we engage in activities that put our gametes 
at risk of joining with others and growing into persons, we assume the costs of 
that risky activity. She calls this the Hazmat Theory of parental 
responsibility. The theory is novel and important, and has far-reaching 
consequences for the ethics of procreation, parenting, and population, implying 
among other things that that the only way to avoid acquiring parental 
responsibilities may be to "abstain from sexual intercourse or surgically 
interfere with our gamete-release system." For these reasons the theory merits 
careful scrutiny. In this article I criticize the theory's account of how 
parental responsibility is acquired and its treatment of the standard of care 
expected of gamete possessors, and argue that it fails to properly account for a 
distinction between procreative costs and parental responsibility. Even if 
gametes are hazardous, it does not follow that parental responsibility in 
Weinberg's sense is acquired whenever one brings new persons into existence.

People suffering from mental illness experience poor physical health outcomes, 
including an average life expectancy of 25 years less than the rest of the 
population. Stigma is a frequent barrier to accessing behavioral health 
services. Health equity refers to the opportunity for all people to experience 
optimal health; the social determinants of health can enable or impede health 
equity. Recommendations from the U.S. government and the World Health 
Organization support mental health promotion while recognizing barriers that 
preclude health equity. The United States Preventive Services Task Force 
recently recommended screening all adults for depression. The Satcher Health 
Leadership Institute at the Morehouse School of Medicine (SHLI/MSM) is committed 
to developing leaders who will help to reduce health disparities as the nation 
moves toward health equity. The SHLI/MSM Integrated Care Leadership Program 
(ICLP) provides clinical and administrative healthcare professionals with 
knowledge and training to develop culturally-sensitive integrated care 
practices. Integrating behavioral health and primary care improves quality of 
life and lowers health system costs.

There is anecdotal evidence of variation in the treatment of patients with 
metastatic melanoma. We aimed to describe the decision-making process physicians 
use to define resectability and injectability in patients with metastatic 
melanoma, and to identify patient characteristics associated with unresectable 
and injectable lesions. Physicians in Germany, France and the UK who manage 
patients with metastatic melanoma completed a questionnaire and case report 
forms on lesion resectability and injectability. In total, 122 physicians 
participated in the study, collecting data on 1,193 patients. Physicians' 
resection history was the main factor impacting their resection decisions; those 
who had frequently performed resections in the past were more likely to consider 
a lesion resectable than those who had rarely performed resections. A 
physician's decision to resect varied according to field of expertise; 46% of 
oncologists rarely performed resections, but this was the case for only 10% of 
dermatologists and 26% of dermato-oncologists. Another important factor 
affecting resectability status was the number of in-transit lesions; 49% of 
patients with three or more in-transit lesions were considered resectable 
compared with 73% of patients with fewer than three in-transit lesions. Lesion 
location impacted on injectability status; cutaneous and regional lymph node 
lesions were often considered injectable, whereas distant lesions in the bone, 
brain, lung, and liver were considered uninjectable. Assessment of resectability 
status was influenced by physicians' resection history; this varied according to 
field of expertise, and may reflect the lack of clear guidance on resection for 
patients with advanced melanoma.

As the life expectancy of people in Western countries continues to rise, so too 
does the number of elderly patients. In parallel, robotic surgery continues to 
gain increasing acceptance, allowing for more complex operations to be performed 
by minimally invasive approach and extending indications for surgery to this 
population. The aim of this study is to assess the safety of robotic general 
surgery in patients 70 years and older. From April 2007 to December 2009, 
patients 70 years and older, who underwent various robotic procedures at our 
institution, were stratified into three categories of surgical complexity (low, 
intermediate, and high). There were 73 patients, including 39 women (53.4%) and 
34 men (46.6%). The median age was 75 years (range 70-88 years). There were 7, 
24, and 42 patients included, respectively, in the low, intermediate, and high 
surgical complexity categories. Approximately 50% of patients underwent hepatic 
and pancreatic resections. There was no statistically significant difference 
between the three groups in terms of morbidity, mortality, readmission or 
transfusion. Mean overall operative time was 254 ± 133 min (range 15-560 min). 
Perioperative mortality and morbidity was 1.4% and 15.1%, respectively. 
Transfusion rate was 9.6%, and median length of stay was 6 days (range 
0-30 days). Robotic surgery can be performed safely in the elderly population 
with low mortality, acceptable morbidity, and short hospital stay. Age should 
not be considered as a contraindication to robotic surgery even for advanced 
procedures.

The increased life expectancy of people living with HIV-1 who are taking 
effective anti-retroviral therapeutics is now accompanied by increased 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neurocognitive problems and neuropathological 
features such as increased levels of amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau 
proteins. Others and we have shown that HIV-1 Tat promotes the development of 
AD-like pathology. Indeed, HIV-1 Tat once endocytosed into neurons can alter 
morphological features and functions of endolysosomes as well as increase Aβ 
generation. Caffeine has been shown to have protective actions against AD and 
based on our recent findings that caffeine can inhibit endocytosis in neurons 
and can prevent neuronal Aβ generation, we tested the hypothesis that caffeine 
blocks HIV-1 Tat-induced Aβ generation and tau phosphorylation. In SH-SY5Y cells 
over-expressing wild-type amyloid beta precursor protein (AβPP), we demonstrated 
that HIV-1 Tat significantly increased secreted levels and intracellular levels 
of Aβ as well as cellular protein levels of phosphorylated tau. Caffeine 
significantly decreased levels of secreted and cellular levels of Aβ, and 
significantly blocked HIV-1 Tat-induced increases in secreted and cellular 
levels of Aβ. Caffeine also blocked HIV-1 Tat-induced increases in cellular 
levels of phosphorylated tau. Furthermore, caffeine blocked HIV-1 Tat-induced 
endolysosome dysfunction as indicated by decreased protein levels of 
vacuolar-ATPase and increased protein levels of cathepsin D. These results 
further implicate endolysosome dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD and HAND, 
and by virtue of its ability to prevent and/or block neuropathological features 
associated with AD and HAND caffeine might find use as an effective adjunctive 
therapeutic agent.

Hostile attribution bias (e.g., tendency to interpret the intention of others as 
hostile in ambiguous social contexts) has been associated with impulsive 
aggression in adults, but the results are mixed and the complete sequence of 
hostile inferential processes leading to aggression has not been investigated 
yet. The goal of this event-related brain potentials (ERPs) study was to track 
the neural activity associated with the violation of expectations about hostile 
versus nonhostile intentions in aggressive and nonaggressive individuals and 
examine how this neural activity relates to self-reported hostile attributional 
bias and impulsive aggression in real life. To this end, scenarios with a 
hostile versus nonhostile social context followed by a character's ambiguous 
aversive behavior were presented to readers, and ERPs to critical words that 
specified the hostile versus nonhostile intent behind the behavior were 
analysed. Thirty-seven aggressive and fifty nonaggressive individuals 
participated in the study. The presentation of a critical word that violated 
hostile expectation caused an N400 response that was significantly larger in 
aggressive than nonaggressive individuals. Results also showed an enhanced late 
positive potential-like component in aggressive individuals when hostile 
intention scenarios took place in a nonhostile context, which is associated with 
impulsive aggression in real life even after having controlled for the effect of 
self-reported hostile attributional bias. The Hostile Expectancy Violation 
paradigm evaluated in this study represents a promising tool to investigate the 
relationship between the online processing of hostile intent in others and 
impulsive aggression. Aggr. Behav. 43:217-229, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

OBJECTIVE: To guide family physicians in creating preventive screening and 
treatment plans for their elderly patients.
SOURCES OF INFORMATION: The MEDLINE database was searched for Canadian 
guidelines on primary health care and the elderly; guidelines or meta-analyses 
or practice guidelines or systematic reviews related to mass screening in those 
aged 80 and older and the frail elderly, limited to between 2006 and July 2016; 
and articles on preventive health services for the elderly related to family 
practice or family physicians, limited to English-language publications between 
2012 and July 2016.
MAIN MESSAGE: Estimating life expectancy is not an easy or precise science, but 
frailty is an emerging concept that can help with this. The Canadian Task Force 
on Preventive Health Care offers cancer screening guidelines, but they are less 
clear for patients older than 74 years and management plans need to be 
individualized. Estimating remaining years of life helps guide your 
recommendations for preventive screening and treatment plans. Risks often 
increase along with an increase in frailty and comorbidity. Conversely, benefits 
often diminish as life expectancy decreases. Preventive management plans should 
take into account the patient's perspective and be mutually agreed upon. A 
mnemonic device for key primary care preventive areas-CCFP, short for cancer, 
cardiovascular disease, falls and osteoporosis, and preventive 
immunizations-might be useful.
CONCLUSION: Family physicians might find addressing the following areas helpful 
when considering a preventive health intervention: age, life expectancy 
(including concept of frailty), comorbidities and functional status, risks and 
benefits of screening or treatment, and values and preferences of the patient.

OBJECTIVE: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a very common and costly pain 
problem concerning the temporomandibular joint. A previous study has shown that 
for the treatment of acute myogenic TMD, TheraBite® (TB) offers a faster and 
greater effect than usual care consisting of physical therapy (PT). This study 
estimates the cost-effectiveness of TB compared to PT.
METHODS: Differences in costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between TB 
and PT are analyzed using a decision model.
RESULTS: The point estimate for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is 
-28,068 EUR (-30,191 USD) per QALY (dominant) for TB versus PT. At the 
willingness-to-pay ratio of 20,000 EUR (21,513 USD) per QALY, TB has a 97% 
probability of being cost-effective compared to PT.
CONCLUSION: TB is expected to be cost-effective compared to PT for the treatment 
of acute myogenic TMD, offering faster recovery of quality of life for patients, 
at a lower cost to society.

There remains a persistent gap in health outcomes between wealthy and poor 
countries. Basic measures such as life expectancy and infant and under-five 
mortality remain divergent, with preventable deaths being unacceptably high, 
despite significant efforts to reduce these disparities. We examine the impact 
of empowerment, measured by Freedom House's ratings of country's political 
rights and civil liberties, while controlling for per capita gross domestic 
product, secondary school enrollment, and income inequality, on national health 
outcomes. Using data from 1970 to 2013 across 149 countries, our results 
suggest, quite strongly, that higher levels of empowerment have a significant 
positive association with life expectancy, particularly for females, and lower 
rates of infant and under-five mortality. Our results point to the need for 
efforts to stimulate economic growth be accompanied with reforms to increase the 
levels empowerment through increasing political rights and civil liberties.

Designing Solutions for the Retirement System - In Search of Balance between 
Economy and Health.

University of Silesia in Katowice , Bytom , Poland.

Social security system currently faces a number of difficulties arising of 
changes in the demographic structure of societies, like the decrease in 
fertility, lengthening of life expectancy, and unfavorable change in the 
proportion of the population receiving retirement benefits to the population in 
working age. In result, social security systems are being subjected to 
transition aimed at securing their financial stability, part of which is a 
tendency to rise the retirement age and eliminate all the incentives to 
prematurely exit the labor market. On the other hand, this process of 
transition, as observed in Poland, is being driven mainly by political processes 
and due to economic reasons, while lacking public health evidence. This raises a 
danger that in final result the financial savings will be illusory only and that 
the final configuration of the system will be inconsistent with the actual 
social needs of the population and will not efficiently protect against the 
social risks. In this article, we present arguments for using the Healthy Life 
Years indicator in analyses relating to the performance of social security 
systems. The indicator may help to reflect differences in health status of 
different professional groups and adjust system's solutions to conditions 
characterizing these groups, in terms of both risk protection and prevention.

To encourage data sharing in the life sciences, supporting tools need to 
minimize effort and maximize incentives. We have created infrastructure that 
makes it easy to create portals that supports dataset sharing and simplified 
publishing of the datasets as high quality linked data. We report here on our 
infrastructure and its use in the creation of a melanoma dataset portal. This
