BACKGROUND: Arrhythmias determine life expectancy in patients with hereditary 
myopathies.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to summarize recent advances in the diagnosis 
and management of arrhythmias in hereditary myopathies.
METHODS: Literature search via PubMed and inclusion of own experiences were 
performed.
RESULTS: All types of arrhythmias can be found in patients with hereditary 
myopathies, but some are more prevalent than others. Arrhythmias reported in 
myopathies include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, sick-sinus syndrome, 
preexcitation syndromes, atrioventricular conduction delay, intraventricular 
conduction delay, and ventricular tachycardia. Sudden cardiac death is a common 
finding in certain myopathies, and patients at risk for ventricular arrhythmias 
and sudden cardiac death should be identified early enough to implant a 
cardioverter-defibrillator to prevent a fatal outcome. Myopathies associated 
with a high risk for arrhythmias include laminopathies, Emery-Dreifuss muscular 
dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy I, mitochondrial myopathies, fatty-acid oxidation 
defects, and dystrophinopathies. To detect arrhythmias with high risk for sudden 
cardiac death, patients require close follow-up investigations or an implantable 
loop recorder. Documentation of severe arrhythmias requires immediate treatment 
according to established guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with certain hereditary myopathies carry an increased risk 
for developing severe supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias and for dying 
of sudden cardiac death. Close follow-up and long-term surveillance of the 
electrocardiogram may prevent fatal complications of arrhythmias in these 
patients.

The ability of Listeria (L.) monocytogenes to convert glucosinolates into 
antimicrobial isothiocyanates was investigated. Mustard glucosinolates in pure 
(sinigrin) or extract forms (sinigrin, oriental; sinalbin, yellow mustard) were 
used in broth media and in a polyvinyl polyethylene glycol graft copolymer (PPG) 
packaging film with bologna to examine their value as antimicrobial precursors 
for the control of L. monocytogenes viability and extension of bologna 
shelf-life at 4 °C. During broth tests with deodorized (myrosinase-inactivated) 
mustard extracts (10 d at 20 °C) or with purified sinigrin (21 d at 20 °C) L. 
monocytogenes was only inhibited when exogenous myrosinase was added. None the 
less, the organism was able to hydrolyze almost half the pure sinigrin by 21 d 
in tests without added enzyme. Reductions in sinigrin levels were measured by 
reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and in the absence of L. monocytogenes or 
added myrosinase the glucosinolate was stable. When pure sinigrin, oriental or 
yellow mustard extracts were incorporated in PPG films containing 3, 5 and 6% 
(w/w) of the corresponding glucosinolate and used to package bologna inoculated 
with 4 log CFU/g L. monocytogenes, the pathogen became undetectable in bologna 
packed with the oriental mustard extract at 52 d storage and remained 
undetectable at 70 d. The yellow mustard extract was less inhibitory and the 
pure sinigrin was not antimicrobial. L. monocytogenes numbers reached >7 log 
CFU/g in the film and untreated controls at 17 d storage. At 35 d storage, 
samples packed with control film contained sufficient numbers of lactic acid 
bacteria (LAB) (>7 log CFU/g) to be considered spoiled, whereas treatments 
containing mustard or sinigrin remained <7 log CFU/g LAB for ≤ 70 d. L. 
monocytogenes played a key role in exerting control over its own viability in 
bologna by hydrolysis of the glucosinolate in the oriental mustard film, but 
other antimicrobials in treatments may have contributed.

Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. jmulli12@Jhmi.edu

PURPOSE: A recent update of the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study-4 
concluded that men older than 65 years treated with radical prostatectomy had no 
survival advantage compared to men treated with watchful waiting. We examined 
the proportion and outcomes of men 65 years old or older with low risk disease 
who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our institutional radical prostatectomy database with 
more than 19,000 patients was queried for men 65 years old or older with low 
risk prostate cancer. Pathological and survival outcomes were assessed. 
Subanalysis was done on men 70 years old or older to determine whether outcomes 
among older men differed by age.
RESULTS: A total of 1,560 men (8.1%) 65 years old or older with low risk 
prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy between 1983 and 2010. After 
radical prostatectomy 38.3% of the men had evidence of more aggressive cancer, 
including Gleason score 7 or greater, or extraprostatic extension. After radical 
prostatectomy actuarial 5, 10 and 15-year biochemical recurrence-free survival 
was 93.2%, 89.2% and 82.2%, prostate cancer specific survival was 99.7%, 98.4% 
and 97.2%, and overall survival was 96.1%, 83.5% and 60.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Fewer than 10% of men treated with radical prostatectomy at our 
institution were 65 years old or older with low risk prostate cancer. Despite a 
high prevalence of aggressive disease discovered at surgery these men 
experienced excellent long-term survival. Treatment recommendations in older men 
with low risk prostate cancer should be made after careful consideration of life 
expectancy based on comorbidities and potential adverse outcomes of treatment.

Self-rated health as a comprehensive indicator of lifestyle-related health 
status.

Tokyo, Japan.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usefulness of self-rated health (SRH) as a 
comprehensive indicator of lifestyle-related health status by examining the 
relationships between SRH and: (1) history of cancer and cardiovascular disease; 
(2) treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia; (3) abnormalities in 
clinical parameters including blood pressure, fasting glucose, and lipids; and 
(4) lifestyle habits.
METHODS: 3744 health-check examinees at Tokai University Hachioji Hospital seen 
between April 2009 and March 2010 were enrolled. SRH was graded as "good," 
"relatively good," "relatively poor," or "poor." For statistical comparison, the 
differences among "healthy" (=good), "relatively healthy" (=relatively good), 
and "unhealthy" (=relatively poor plus poor) groups were examined. 
Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios were calculated to remove the confounding effect of 
age, using the healthy group as the reference. The Mantel-extension method was 
used as a trend test.
RESULTS: 1049 subjects rated their health as good, 2194 as relatively good, 428 
as relatively poor, and 73 as poor. The prevalence of all diseases showed 
significant odds ratios and trends as SRH deteriorated. Obesity, blood pressure, 
glucose metabolism, and lipids deteriorated significantly as SRH became poorer, 
and a trend was observed in all parameters. Weight change, exercise, smoking, 
and rest showed significant odds ratios and trends as SRH deteriorated.
CONCLUSION: SRH appears useful as a comprehensive indicator of lifestyle-related 
health status.

Estimating mortality differences in developed countries from survey information 
on maternal and paternal orphanhood.

In general, the use of indirect methods is limited to developing countries. 
Developed countries are usually assumed to have no need to apply such methods 
because detailed demographic data exist. However, the potentialities of 
demographic analysis with direct methods are limited to the characteristics of 
available macro data on births, deaths, and migration. For instance, in many 
Western countries, official population statistics do not permit the estimation 
of mortality by socioeconomic status (SES) or migration background, or for 
estimating the relationship between parity and mortality. In order to overcome 
these shortcomings, I modify and extend the so-called orphanhood method for 
indirect estimation of adult mortality from survey information on maternal and 
paternal survival to allow its application to populations of developed 
countries. The method is demonstrated and tested with data from two independent 
Italian cross-sectional surveys by estimating overall and SES-specific life 
expectancy. The empirical applications reveal that the proposed method can be 
used successfully for estimating levels and trends of mortality differences in 
developed countries and thus offers new prospects for the analysis of mortality.

Wolbachia induces male-specific mortality in the mosquito Culex pipiens (LIN 
strain).

Institutes of the Life Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, 
Pennsylvania, United States of America. jlr54@psu.edu

BACKGROUND: Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbionts that infect a 
diverse range of invertebrates, including insects, arachnids, crustaceans and 
filarial nematodes. Wolbachia are responsible for causing diverse reproductive 
alterations in their invertebrate hosts that maximize their transmission to the 
next generation. Evolutionary theory suggests that due to maternal inheritance, 
Wolbachia should evolve toward mutualism in infected females, but strict 
maternal inheritance means there is no corresponding force to select for 
Wolbachia strains that are mutualistic in males.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using cohort life-table analysis, we demonstrate 
that in the mosquito Culex pipiens (LIN strain), Wolbachia-infected females show 
no fitness costs due to infection. However, Wolbachia induces up to a 30% 
reduction in male lifespan.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that the Wolbachia infection of 
the Culex pipiens LIN strain is virulent in a sex-specific manner. Under 
laboratory situations where mosquitoes generally mate at young ages, Wolbachia 
strains that reduce male survival could evolve by drift because increased 
mortality in older males is not a significant selective force.

INTRODUCTION: Since alendronate became available in generic form in the Unites 
States in 2008, its price has been decreasing. The objective of this study was 
to investigate the impact of alendronate cost on the cost-effectiveness of 
osteoporosis screening and treatment in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: Microsimulation cost-effectiveness model of osteoporosis screening and 
treatment for U.S. women age 65 and older. We assumed screening initiation at 
age 65 with central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and alendronate 
treatment for individuals with osteoporosis; with a comparator of "no screening" 
and treatment only after fracture occurrence. We evaluated annual alendronate 
costs of $20 through $800; outcome measures included fractures; nursing home 
admission; medication adverse events; death; costs; quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs); and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2010 U.S. dollars 
per QALY gained. A lifetime time horizon was used, and direct costs were 
included. Base-case and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Base-case analysis results showed that at annual alendronate costs of 
$200 or less, osteoporosis screening followed by treatment was cost-saving, 
resulting in lower total costs than no screening as well as more QALYs (10.6 
additional quality-adjusted life-days). When assuming alendronate costs of $400 
through $800, screening and treatment resulted in greater lifetime costs than no 
screening but was highly cost-effective, with ICERs ranging from $714 per QALY 
gained through $13,902 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
revealed that the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening followed by 
alendronate treatment was robust to joint input parameter estimate variation at 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY at all alendronate costs 
evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis screening followed by alendronate treatment is 
effective and highly cost-effective for postmenopausal women across a range of 
alendronate costs, and may be cost-saving at annual alendronate costs of $200 or 
less.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive inherited disease of 
Caucasian populations. As a result of a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies there has been a dramatic increase in the life expectancy of patients 
with CF in the last decades and 50% of patients are now adults. This review will 
focus on the disease in adults and the provision of appropriate care. The 
complex care required to improve the survival and quality of life in the adult 
patients can best be provided in a dedicated adult cystic fibrosis unit. These 
units currently exist in many European countries, but more are needed in Italy.

We investigated the effects of two types of nonweight-bearing exercise on 
changes in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and procollagen type 1 
C-peptide (PIP). BAP is a specific marker of bone synthesis, whereas P1P 
reflects synthesis of type 1 collagen in other organs as well as bone. Eight 
participants performed static and dynamic unilateral knee extensions. BAP and 
PIP were measured before, and at 1, 2, 24, 48, and 72 hr after exercise. PIP 
increased at 24 hr after a static knee extension exercise, whereas BAP did not 
change during the experimental period. We found no changes in these markers 
after dynamic exercise. These results imply that type I collagen synthesis in 
tendons increases after static exercise.

Mechanism-based approach to the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals: 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/pharmacoeconomic analysis of rituximab for 
follicular lymphoma.

Pink J(1), Lane S, Hughes DA.

Author information:

and Social Care Research, Bangor University, Bangor, Wales.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Economic value is an important consideration during 
all phases of the drug development process. We previously published an article 
in PharmacoEconomics in which we described a mechanism-based economic modelling 
approach that incorporates data obtained during phase II clinical studies on the 
relationships between dose, exposure and response. We now describe case studies 
of rituximab for the treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma based on 
this methodology.
METHODS: We utilized a population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model 
linking serum rituximab concentration to progression-free survival, to simulate 
the effectiveness of rituximab in various clinical contexts. These served as 
inputs to economic models of follicular lymphoma, based on National Institute 
for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) appraisals, to assess the cost 
effectiveness of rituximab. Our results were compared with trial-based estimates 
from the NICE appraisals. In a further analysis, we simulated the results of an 
ongoing trial to generate predictions of cost effectiveness.
RESULTS: Our analyses suggest an acceptable degree of concordance between 
simulation- and trial-based estimates of cost effectiveness. For first-line and 
maintenance therapy, deviations of £2,099 and £1,355 per QALY, respectively, 
from trial-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates of £8,290 and 
£7,721 per QALY gained would not affect reimbursement decisions. The probability 
of rituximab-containing regimens being cost effective at £20,000 and £30,000 per 
QALY thresholds was 1 for both first-line and maintenance therapy in both 
simulated and trial-based analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses demonstrate the feasibility of mechanism-based 
economic analyses, which may have applications during drug development to the 
following: (i) directing future research based on the cost of reducing 
uncertainty; (ii) assessing subgroups, dosing schedules and protocol deviations; 
and (iii) informing strategic research and development and pricing decisions.

Oral health-related quality of life of older people from three South American 
cities.

Author information:

Chile.

OBJECTIVE: To describe subjective oral health status and its association with 
overall health conditions and socioeconomic factors in the elderly (60 years and 
older) living in the capital cities with the oldest average populations in South 
America.
BACKGROUND: Oral diseases are a public health problem, frequently neglected in 
older adults. In recent years, the subjective assessment of psychological and 
social consequences of the problems related to oral health has been valued. One 
of the instruments used to estimate the Oral Health-Quality of Life is the 
Geriatric Oral Health Assessment (GOHAI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Representative samples from SABE study (1999-2000) of 
Santiago (n = 1301), Buenos Aires (n = 1043), and Montevideo (n = 1450) aged 60 
and over community-dwelling people. We assessed OH-QoL (GOHAI), self-reported 
missing teeth, denture use, and self-rated-health, among other indicators. 
Logistic regression models(GOHAI < 58) for each city, adjusted by sex and age, 
were applied.
RESULTS: GOHAI average scores were higher in Montevideo (54.8 ± 6.1) than in 
Buenos Aires (53.1 ± 7.4) and Santiago (49.9 ± 8.6). A pronounced gradient of 
the oral condition and GOHAI scores were observed within the three-cities. 
Denture use -less prevalent in Santiago and more common among women- is a 
protective factor against a poor OH-QoL.
CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic inequalities in oral health status and OH-QoL are 
observed in the three cities. The increasing life expectancy emphasizes the need 
to integrate prevention and treatment efforts, as a way to improve OH-QoL over 
the course of a lifetime.

Change in health and self-perceptions of aging over 16 years: the role of 
psychological resources.

Sargent-Cox KA(1), Anstey KJ, Luszcz MA.

Author information:
(1)Centre for Research in Ageing, Health & Wellbeing, Australian National 
University. Kerry.Sargent-Cox@anu.edu.au

OBJECTIVE: Self-perceptions of aging (SPA) are argued to be an indicator of the 
ability to adapt to heath decline in late life. Our objective was to examine the 
influence of psychological resources in maintaining positive self-perceptions of 
aging in the face of declining health in older adults.
METHODS: Time-varying change in health (medical conditions), physical 
functioning (ADLs), and psychological resources (expectancy of control and 
self-esteem) on change in SPA were examined over 16 years (5 waves) in a large 
representative sample (N = 1569) of older adults (65 + years at baseline) from 
the Australian Longitudinal Study of Aging.
RESULTS: Multilevel structural equation models revealed mediating effects of 
psychological resources at the within-person level for the relationship between 
decline in ADLs and SPA. At the between-person level, the relationship between 
medical conditions and SPA was not mediated by psychological resources, whereas 
ADLs and SPA were shown to be indirectly associated through self-esteem and 
expectancy of control.
CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that maintaining self-esteem and an expectancy 
of personal control can buffer the effects of declining ADLs on perceptions of 
aging. Findings have clinical implications regarding psychological interventions 
aimed at improving resilience in older adults, which may ultimately increase 
health outcomes and quality of life.

using X-ray treatments.

Mahmoud BS(1), Coker R, Su YC.

Author information:

Pascagoula, MS 39567, USA. bm547@msstate.edu

AIMS: To determine the efficacy of X-ray processes in inactivating L. 
monocytogenes levels in smoked catfish during storage at 5°C and to determine 
the effects of X-ray doses on controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria on 
smoked catfish during storage at 5°C for up to 5 weeks.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Smoked catfish fillets inoculated with L. monocytogenes 
were treated with 0.0-2.0 kGy X-ray and stored at 5°C for 5 weeks. The negative 
controls (uninoculated/untreated) and uninoculated samples treated with the 
lowest (0.1 kGy) and highest (2.0 kGy) doses were stored at 5°C and tested for 
psychrotrophs count during the 5 weeks of storage. The initial L. monocytogenes 
population on smoked catfish was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced to 
undetectable level by a treatment of 1.0 kGy or higher. The initial 
psychrotrophs count on smoked catfish was significantly reduced from 4.7 CFU 
g(-1) to below the detectable level by a treatment with 2.0 kGy.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoked catfish treated with 2.0 kGy X-ray had no detectable L. 
monocytogenes throughout 35 days of storage at 5°C. A treatment with 2.0 kGy 
X-ray also kept the levels of psychrotrophs in the smoked catfish within the 
acceptable level until 35 days.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this investigation indicate 
that X-ray at 2.0 kGy can eliminate L. monocytogenes and extend the shelf life 
of smoked catfish stored at refrigeration temperature.

INTRODUCTION: With the improvement of therapeutic options for the treatment of 
breast cancer, the development of brain metastases has become a major limitation 
to life expectancy in many patients. Therefore, our aim was to identify 
molecular markers associated with the development of brain metastases in breast 
cancer.
METHODS: Patterns of chromosomal aberrations in primary breast tumors and brain 
metastases were compared with array-comparative genetic hybridization (CGH). The 
most significant region was further characterized in more detail by 
microsatellite and gene-expression analysis, and finally, the possible target 
gene was screened for mutations.
RESULTS: The array CGH results showed that brain metastases, in general, display 
similar chromosomal aberrations as do primary tumors, but with a notably higher 
frequency. Statistically significant differences were found at nine different 
chromosomal loci, with a gain and amplification of EGFR (7p11.2) and a loss of 
10q22.3-qter being among the most significant aberrations in brain metastases (P 
< 0.01; false discovery rate (fdr) < 0.04). Allelic imbalance (AI) patterns at 
10q were further verified in 77 unmatched primary tumors and 21 brain 
metastases. AI at PTEN loci was found significantly more often in brain 
metastases (52%) and primary tumors with a brain relapse (59%) compared with 
primary tumors from patients without relapse (18%; P = 0.003) or relapse other 
than brain tumors (12%; P = 0.006). Loss of PTEN was especially frequent in 
HER2-negative brain metastases (64%). Furthermore, PTEN mRNA expression was 
significantly downregulated in brain metastases compared with primary tumors, 
and PTEN mutations were frequently found in brain metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that brain metastases often show very 
complex genomic-aberration patterns, suggesting a potential role of PTEN and 
EGFR in brain metastasis formation.

Pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis.

USA.

Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (PLCH) is a relatively uncommon lung 
disease that generally, but not invariably, occurs in cigarette smokers. The 
pathologic hallmark of PLCH is the accumulation of Langerhans and other 
inflammatory cells in small airways, resulting in the formation of nodular 
inflammatory lesions. While the overwhelming majority of patients are smokers, 
mechanisms by which smoking induces this disease are not known, but likely 
involve a combination of events resulting in enhanced recruitment and activation 
of Langerhans cells in small airways. Bronchiolar inflammation may be 
accompanied by variable lung interstitial and vascular involvement. While 
cellular inflammation is prominent in early disease, more advanced stages are 
characterized by cystic lung destruction, cicatricial scarring of airways, and 
pulmonary vascular remodeling. Pulmonary function is frequently abnormal at 
presentation. Imaging of the chest with high resolution chest CT scanning may 
show characteristic nodular and cystic abnormalities. Lung biopsy is necessary 
for a definitive diagnosis, although may not be required in instances were 
imaging findings are highly characteristic. There is no general consensus 
regarding the role of immunosuppressive therapy in smokers with PLCH. All 
smokers must be counseled on the importance of smoking cessation, which may 
result in regression of disease and obviate the need for systemic 
immunosuppressive therapy. The prognosis for most patients is relatively good, 
particularly if longitudinal lung function testing shows stability. 
Complications like pneumothoraces and secondary pulmonary hypertension may 
shorten life expectancy. Patients with progressive disease may require lung 
transplantation.

The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is expected to double over the next 
20 years owing to the increase in life expectancy. This progressive disease has 
several implications relating to oral health, and many are manageable with 
proper awareness and knowledge about the disease. This article reviews the 
epidemiology, pathophysiology, and characteristics of PD, as well as the 
treatments and oral health considerations to enable dental hygienists to 
undertake an informed approach to patient management strategies and provide 
optimal care.

Cognitive decline becomes more prevalent than ever in parallel with the 
increasing life expectancy of the population. Alzheimer' disease (AD) and 
cerebral vascular lesions are common in the elderly and represent, with 
increased age, the most frequent contributors to cognitive decline. It is now 
believed that these pathologies frequently coexist in the same brain. The border 
discriminating vascular dementia from AD is blurred and challenges our 
understanding of these clinical entities. Further research, at both basic and 
clinical levels, is mandatory in order to better understand the interactions of 
vascular ischemic injury and primary degenerative physiopathologies of the 
brain, in order to prevent and better manage patients with cognitive decline. We 
review recent published clinical evidence of silent brain ischemia as a 
contributor to cognitive decline and dementia. Microemboli, from both cardiac 
and vascular origins, have been shown to be associated with structural changes 
in the brain. The role of transcranial Doppler as an objective tool for 
detecting and quantifying microemboli is discussed in light of recent clinical 
evidence.

Surgical management of ventral and ventrolateral foramen magnum meningiomas: 
report on a 64-case series and review of the literature.

Foramen magnum meningioma poses a challenge for neurosurgeons. Prognosis has 
generally improved with diagnostic and surgical advances over the past two 
decades; however, it may ultimately depend more on the surgeon's ability to 
tailor the approach and interpret intraoperative risks in single cases. The 
series comprised 64 patients operated on for ventral and ventrolateral foramen 
magnum meningioma. All patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance 
imaging and received surgery via the dorsolateral route, rendering the series 
homogeneous in neuroradiological workup and surgical treatment. Particular to 
this series was that the majority of patients were of advanced age (n = 29; age, 
>65 years), had serious functional impairment (n = 30, Karnofski score <70), and 
large tumors (mean diameter, 3.5 cm). Total tumor removal was achieved in 52 (81 
%) patients; operative mortality was nil. Early outcome varied depending on 
difficulties encountered at surgery (cranial nerve position and type of 
involvement in particular) and type of preoperative dysfunction. Long-tract 
signs and cerebellar deficits improved in 74 and 77 % of cases, respectively, 
but only 27 % of cranial nerve deficits did so. Surgical complications most 
often involved the cranial nerves: cranial nerve impairment, especially of the 
9th through the 12th cranial nerves, due to stretching or encasement was noted 
in 44 cases. At final outcome assessment, two thirds of the cranial nerve 
deficits cleared, and all but two patients returned to a normal productive life. 
One patient was reoperated on during the follow-up period. Foramen magnum 
meningiomas behave like clival or spinal tumors depending on their prevalent 
extension. A dorsolateral approach tailored to tumor position and extension and 
meticulous surgical technique allow for definitive control of surgical 
complications. Scrupulous postoperative care may prevent dysphagia, a major 
persistent complication of surgery. Long-term observation of indolent tumor 
behavior at follow-up suggests that incomplete resection may be a viable 
surgical treatment option.

The prospects for many boys born with hemophilia today include a normal life 
expectancy and minimal to no joint disease. However, despite the availability of 
safe replacement clotting factor concentrates and effective antiviral treatment, 
the aging patient with hemophilia today faces many challenges. These include 
management of their hemophilia as well as the same age-related health issues as 
experienced in the general population. While increasing, data on the prevalence 
of comorbidities and their management in the hemophilia population remain 
limited. This review will focus on issues related to management of hemophilia 
and complications of cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, hepatic, and renal 
disease. Available research is summarized and potential approaches to management 
are discussed.

Does diabetes care differ by type of chronic comorbidity?: An evaluation of the 
Piette and Kerr framework.

Management, Veterans Affairs New Jersey Health Care System, East Orange, New 
Jersey, USA. sriram.pentakota@va.gov

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between diabetes care and types of 
comorbidity, classified by the degree to which their treatment is concordant 
with that for diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study (fiscal year [FY] 2001 
to FY 2004) of 42,826 veterans with new-onset diabetes in FY 2003. Veterans were 
classified into five chronic comorbid illness groups (CCIGs): none, concordant 
only, discordant only, both concordant and discordant, and dominant. Five 
diabetes-related care measures were assessed in FY 2004 (guideline-consistent 
testing and treatment goals for HbA(1c) and LDL cholesterol and diabetes-related 
outpatient visits). Analyses included logistic regressions adjusting for age, 
race, sex, marital status, priority code, and interaction between CCIGs and 
visit frequency.
RESULTS: Only 20% of patients had no comorbidities. Mean number of visits per 
year ranged from 7.8 (no CCIG) to 17.5 (dominant CCIG). In unadjusted analyses, 
presence of any illness was associated with equivalent or better care. In the 
fully adjusted model, we found interaction between CCIG and visit frequency. 
When visits were <7 per year, the odds of meeting the goal of HbA(1c) <8% were 
similar in the concordant (odds ratio 0.96 [95% CI 0.83-1.11]) and lower in the 
discordant (0.90 [0.81-0.99]) groups compared with the no comorbidity group. 
Among patients with >24 visits per year, these odds were insignificant. Dominant 
CCIG was associated with substantially reduced care for glycemic control for all 
visit categories and for lipid management at all but the highest visit category.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that diabetes care varies by types of 
comorbidity. Concordant illnesses result in similar or better care, regardless 
of visit frequency. Discordant illnesses are associated with diminished care: an 
effect that decreases as visit frequency increases.

Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine: wicked problems, ragged edges and 
ethical precipices.

Fleck LM(1).

Medicine, 965 Fee Road C-208, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI

In the age of genomic medicine we can often now do the genetic testing that will 
permit more accurate personal tailoring of medications to obtain the best 
therapeutic results. This is certainly a medically and morally desirable result. 
However, in other areas of medicine pharmacogenomics is generating consequences 
that are much less ethically benign and much less amenable to a satisfactory 
ethical resolution. More specifically, we will often find ourselves left with 
'wicked problems,' 'ragged edges,' and well-disguised ethical precipices. This 
will be especially true with regard to these extraordinarily expensive cancer 
drugs that generally yield only extra weeks or extra months of life. Our key 
ethical question is this: Does every individual faced with cancer have a just 
claim to receive treatment with one of more of these targeted cancer therapies 
at social expense? If any of these drugs literally made the difference between 
an unlimited life expectancy (a cure) and a premature death, that would be a 
powerful moral consideration in favor of saying that such individuals had a 
strong just claim to that drug. However, what we are beginning to discover is 
that different individuals with different genotypes respond more or less 
positively to these targeted drugs with some in a cohort gaining a couple extra 
years of life while others gain only extra weeks or months. Should only the 
strongest responders have a just claim to these drugs at social expense when 
there is no bright line that separates strong responders from modest responders 
from marginal responders? This is the key ethical issue we address. We argue 
that no ethical theory yields a satisfactory answer to this question, that we 
need instead fair and respectful processes of rational democratic deliberation.

Heslington, York, UK.

STUDY DESIGN: Multicentered randomized controlled trial with quality of life and 
resource use data collected.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
yoga intervention plus usual care compared with usual care alone for chronic or 
recurrent low back pain.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Yoga has been shown as an effective intervention for 
treating chronic or recurrent low back pain. However, there is little evidence 
on its cost-effectiveness. The data are extracted from a pragmatic, 
multicentered, randomized controlled trial that has been conducted to evaluate 
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 12-week progressive program of 
yoga plus usual care in patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain.
METHODS: With this trial data, a cost-effectiveness analysis during the time 
period of 12 months from both perspectives of the UK National Health Service and 
the societal is presented. Main outcome measure is an incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: From the perspective of the U.K. National Health Service, yoga 
intervention yields an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £13,606 per QALY. 
Given a willingness to pay for an additional QALY of £20,000, the probability of 
yoga intervention being cost-effective is 72%. From the perspective of the 
society, yoga intervention is a dominant treatment compared with usual care 
alone. This result is surrounded by fewer uncertainties-the probability of yoga 
being cost-effective reaches 95% at a willingness to pay for an additional QALY 
of £20,000. Sensitive analyses suggest the same results that yoga intervention 
is likely to be cost-effective in both perspectives.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of this trial, 12 weekly group classes of specialized 
yoga are likely to be a cost-effective intervention for treating patients with 
chronic or recurrent low back pain.

Cost-effectiveness evaluation in Sweden of escitalopram compared with 
venlafaxine extended-release as first-line treatment in major depressive 
disorder.

Nordström G(1), Danchenko N, Despiegel N, Marteau F.

Author information:
(1)Psykiatriska kliniken, Hedvägen Trelleborg, Sweden.

OBJECTIVES: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a major public health concern 
associated with a high burden to society, the health-care system, and patients 
and an estimated cost of €3.5 billion in Sweden. The objective of this study was 
to assess the cost-effectiveness of escitalopram versus generic venlafaxine 
extended-release (XR) in MDD, accounting for the full clinical profile of each, 
adopting the Swedish societal perspective, and identifying major cost drivers.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of escitalopram versus venlafaxine XR was analyzed 
over a 6-month time frame, on the basis of a decision tree, for patients with 
MDD seeking primary care treatment in Sweden. Effectiveness outcomes for the 
model were quality-adjusted life-years and probability of sustained remission 
after acute treatment (first 8 weeks) and sustained for 6 months. Cost outcomes 
included direct treatment costs and indirect costs associated with sick leave.
RESULTS: Compared with generic venlafaxine XR, escitalopram was less costly and 
more effective in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (expected gain 0.00865) 
and expected 6-month sustained remission probability (incremental gain 0.0374). 
The better tolerability profile of escitalopram contributed to higher expected 
quality-adjusted life-years and lower health-care resource utilization in terms 
of pharmacological treatment of adverse events (though only a minor component of 
treatment costs). Expected per-patient saving was €169.15 for escitalopram 
versus venlafaxine. Cost from sick leave constituted about 85% of total costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Escitalopram was estimated as more effective and cost saving than 
generic venlafaxine XR in first-line MDD treatment in Sweden, driven by the 
effectiveness and tolerability advantages of escitalopram. The study findings 
are robust and in line with similar pharmacoeconomic analyses.

OBJECTIVE: Although utility-based algorithms have been developed for the 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), their properties are not well 
known compared with those of generic utility measures such as the EQ-5D. Our 
objective was to compare EQ-5D and FACT preference-based scores in cancer 
patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on cross-sectional data 
collected from 472 cancer patients who completed both FACT-General and the 
EQ-5D. Preference-based scores were calculated by using published scoring 
functions for the EQ-5D (Dolan P. Modeling valuations for EuroQol health states. 
Med Care 1997;35:1095-108; Shaw JW, Johnson JA, Coons SJ. US valuation of the 
EQ-5D health states: development and testing of the D1 valuation model. Med Care 
2005;43:203-20) and FACT (Dobrez D, Cella D, Pickard AS, et al. Estimation of 
patient preference-based utility weights from the Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy-General. Value Health 2007;10:266-72; Kind P, Macran S. Eliciting 
social preference weights for Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung 
health states. Pharmacoeconomics 2005;23:1143-53; Cheung YB, Thumboo J, Gao F, 
et al. Mapping the English and Chinese versions of the Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy-General to the EQ-5D utility index. Value Health 2009;12:371-6). 
Scores were compared on the basis of clinical severity by using Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ratings by physicians and 
patients. Relative efficiency of each scoring function was examined by using 
ratios of F statistics.
RESULTS: Mean scores for the overall cohort were lowest when using Kind and 
Macran's FACT UK societal algorithm (0.55, SD 0.09) and highest when using 
Dobrez et al.'s FACT US patient algorithm (0.83, SD 0.08). Mean difference 
scores associated with clinical severity, when extrapolated to quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), had a range of 0.18 QALYs gained using FACT (Kind and 
Macran) to 0.45 QALYs gained using the EQ-5D (Dolan). However, relative 
efficiencies suggested that FACT (Kind and Macran) scores may provide greater 
statistical power to detect significant differences based on clinical severity.
CONCLUSIONS: We found important differences in utilities scores estimated by 
each algorithm, with FACT-based algorithms tending to underestimate the QALY 
benefit compared with algorithms based on the EQ-5D. These differences highlight 
some of the challenges in using disease-specific preference-based measures for 
decision making despite potentially more relevant disease-specific content.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the characteristics of instruments designed to assess the 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children, developed or adapted from 
2000 to 2010 in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Spain, and Uruguay.
METHODS: The protocol-led literature review included database searching (e.g., 
Medline, ISI Science Citation Index) and manual searching to retrieve studies 
focused on measures of HRQOL, health status, or well-being addressed to children 
and adolescents. Country-specific filters were applied to identify studies 
carried out in the participating countries. The characteristics of the 
instruments and type of studies were analyzed. Descriptive characteristics and 
psychometric properties were analyzed following the guidelines of the Scientific 
Advisory Committee of the Medical Outcomes Trust.
RESULTS: Ninety-nine documents were included. Thirty-one questionnaires were 
identified, 24 instruments were adapted, and the psychometric properties of 20 
HRQOL instruments were reported in the study period. There was substantial 
variability in the number and characteristics of the dimensions included. 
Reliability was generally acceptable, and the majority of instruments provided 
data on internal consistency (n = 18) and, to a lesser extent, on test-retest 
reliability (n = 12). Nearly all studies reported construct validity, but only 
four analyzed sensitivity to change.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a scarcity of instruments to measure HRQOL of children and 
adolescents in the countries analyzed. Certain psychometric characteristics have 
been reasonably well tested, but others, most notably sensitivity to change, 
have not been tested in most instruments. Extension of this study to other Latin 
American countries would help to further identify gaps in this area and promote 
the use of HRQOL measurement in children and adolescents in Spanish-speaking 
cultures.
