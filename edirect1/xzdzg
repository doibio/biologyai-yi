preparation. SIGNIFICANCE: Navigating daily life requires us to anticipate 
future events and plan our thoughts and actions accordingly to achieve our 
goals. This forward planning, or proactive control, is thought to be a 
resource-intensive and metabolically costly process that recruits higher-order 
cognitive functions, such as working memory, where relevant thoughts and actions 
have to be maintained online. The current study challenged this notion by 
finding that proactive control can be incrementally relegated to simpler 
processes based on one's learning of stable relationships in the environment, 
thereby reducing the need to actively maintain information online. Individuals 
can come to rely on underlying contingencies in stimuli associated with 
proactive control, even when it is detrimental to their goals.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and 
treatable disease that is characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and 
airflow limitation. The present study reported the burden of COPD, and its 
attributable risk factors, in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region 
between 1990 and 2019, by age, sex and socio-demographic index (SDI).
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study were used to 
report the burden of COPD in the MENA countries. The prevalence, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were presented as counts and 
age-standardised rates per 100,000 population, with their associated 95% 
uncertainty intervals (UIs).
RESULTS: In 2019, the regional age-standardised point prevalence and rates of 
death due to COPD were 2333.9 (2230.1, 2443.6) and 26.1 (22.2, 29.5) per 
100,000, which represent a 30.6% (28.2%, 33.0%) increase and an 18.0% (2.8%, 
30.9%) decrease, respectively, since 1990. The regional age-standardised DALY 
rate in 2019 was 649.1 (574.6, 717.7) per 100,000, which had decreased by 11.8% 
(0.9%, 21.1%) since 1990. Turkey had the highest age-standardised point 
prevalence in 2019 [3287.1 (3187.4, 3380.3)], while Afghanistan had the highest 
age-standardised death [40.4 (24.2, 52.6)] and DALY [964.5 (681.8, 1203.2)] 
rates. The regional age-standardised point prevalence, death and DALY rates in 
2019 increased with advancing age and were higher in males in almost all age 
groups. There was a U-shaped association between SDI and the burden of COPD over 
the period 1990 to 2019. Moreover, in 2019 smoking (43.7%), ambient particulate 
matter pollution (22.8%) and occupational particulate matter (11.4%) had the 
largest proportion of attributable DALYs for both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: COPD is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the 
MENA region, although the age-standardised burden has decreased over the last 
30 years. Nevertheless, COPD accounted for a substantial number of deaths and 
DALYs, especially among the elderly. Programs targeting risk factors, like 
smoking, should be taken into consideration.

Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve have an extreme high risk to develop a 
thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD). TAADs form a leading cause of 
death worldwide, with the majority of deaths being preventable if individuals at 
risk are identified and properly managed. Risk stratification for TAADs in 
bicuspidy is so far solely based on the aortic diameter. Exclusive use of aortic 
wall dimension, as in the current guidelines, is however not sufficient in 
selecting patients vulnerable for future aortic wall complications. Moreover, 
there are no effective medical treatments for TAADs to retain progressive aortic 
dilatation and thus prevent or delay aortic complications. Only surgical 
replacement of the aorta increases life expectancy in patients with a risk for a 
TAAD. Therefore, the next major challenge in the management of TAADs is the 
development of a personalized patient-tailored risk stratification for early 
detection of patients with an increased risk for TAADs, who will benefit from 
surgical resection of the aorta. Several signaling pathways have been studied in 
recent times to develop a patient specific risk stratification model. In this 
paper we discuss TGF-β signaling and downstream signalers as potential markers 
for future aortic complications in bicuspid aortic valve patients.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by X-linked inherited or de novo DMD 
gene mutations predominantly affecting males who develop early-onset muscle 
degeneration, severely affecting their quality of life and leading to reduced 
life expectancy. DMD patients may also develop proliferative retinopathy, 
cataract, ERG abnormalities, altered contrast sensitivity, color vision losses, 
and elevated flash detection thresholds during dark adaptation. Depending on the 
position of the genetic alteration in the large DMD gene, it is associated with 
a lack of the full-length dystrophin protein possibly with an additional loss of 
one or several other dystrophins, which are normally transcribed from internal 
promoters in retina and crystalline lens. During the last decades, the 
properties of the dystrophins have been characterized in patients with different 
genetic alterations and in genetic mouse models of DMD. The complex expression 
pattern of the dystrophins in photoreceptors, Müller glial cells and astrocytes, 
likely influences synaptic transmission, ionic balance and vascular integrity of 
the retina. However, the specific function of each retinal dystrophin remains 
largely unknown. This review describes the current knowledge on dystrophin 
expression, the putative molecular, structural, and physiological properties of 
retinal dystrophins, and the main clinical implications associated with the loss 
of dystrophins in DMD patients and mouse models. Current data and working 
hypotheses warrant future research on retinal dystrophins to increase our 
understanding of dystrophin function in the central nervous system in general 
and to unveil new retinal mechanisms and therapeutic avenues for retinal 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common life-threatening 
gastrointestinal emergency in preterm and term neonates, with the majority of 
cases affecting neonates classified as very low birth weight (VLBW, bw <1500 g). 
Scores for neonatal acute physiology-perinatal extension-II (SNAPPE-II) and 
metabolic derangement acuity score (MDAS) have been developed and utilized to 
assess neonatal morbidity and mortality including the subset of VLBW neonates. 
Serial SNAPPE-II and MDAS scores have been reported in neonates with necrotizing 
enterocolitis to assist in surgical management, yielding mixed results.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between clinical and/or laboratory 
deterioration using SNAPPE-II and MDAS scores measured at the time of NEC 
diagnosis and surgical management of NEC.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated preterm neonates ≥23 weeks gestational age 
who developed pneumatosis intestinalis on radiographic imaging coupled with 
clinical signs of NEC. SNAPPE-II and MDAS scores were calculated within twelve 
hours of birth and within twelve hours of initial finding of pneumatosis 
intestinalis. Baseline characteristics and clinical variables between those who 
did and did not require surgical intervention were compared. Logistic regression 
and receiver - operator characteristics (ROC) curve analyses were also 
performed, and areas under the curve (AUC) computed, to assess the performance 
of SNAPPE-II and MDAS scoring systems to differentiate neonates with NEC in the 
two groups.
RESULTS: Sixty-four neonates were evaluated in our study of which 20 required 
surgical management of NEC. While the baseline SNAPPE-II and MDAS scores did not 
differ between the surgical management and medical management only groups, when 
rescored within 12 h of NEC diagnosis, the surgical management group had 
significantly higher SNAPPE -II (38 (18.5-69) vs. 19 (10-34.5), p = .04) and 
MDAS (2.5 (1-3) vs. 1 (0-2), p = .0004) scores. The AUCs for MDAS 0.77 (95% CI 
0.65-0.89 and 0.71 (95% CI 0.57-0.85) for SNAPPE-II, indicating an acceptable 
level of diagnostic ability of both scoring systems to differentiate between 
those who did and did not need surgical management.
CONCLUSION: SNAPPE II and MDAS scores performed within 12 h of NEC diagnosis may 
be useful in predicting which preterm VLBW neonates will require surgical 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and treatment of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) 
have led to improved life expectancy and achievement of adulthood. Limited data 
on long-term outcomes reported an increased risk of premature death for 
cardiovascular causes, even without congenital heart disease (CHD). The aim of 
this study was to assess the cardiac function in adolescents and young adults 
with 22q11.2DS without CHDs.
METHODS: A total of 32 patients (20M, 12F; mean age 26.00 ± 8.08 years) and a 
healthy control group underwent transthoracic echocardiography, including Tissue 
Doppler Imaging (TDI) and 2-dimensional Speckle Tracking Echocardiography 
(2D-STE).
RESULTS: Compared to controls, 22q11.2DS patients showed a significant increase 
of the left ventricle (LV) diastolic and systolic diameters (p = 0.029 and 
p = 0.035 respectively), interventricular septum thickness (p = 0.005), LV mass 
index (p < 0.001) and aortic root size (p < 0.001). 2D-STE analysis revealed a 
significant reduction of LV global longitudinal strain (p < 0.001) in 22q11.2DS 
than controls. Moreover, several LV diastolic parameters were significantly 
different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an echocardiographic follow-up in 
22q11.2DS patients without CHDs can help to identify subclinical impairment of 
the LV and evaluate a potential progression of aortic root dilation over time, 
improving outcomes, reducing long-term complications and allowing for a better 
prognosis.

The incidence of age-related neurodegenerative disorders has risen with the 
increase of life expectancy. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of such disorders is 
in most cases only possible when the neurodegeneration status is already 
advanced, and symptoms are evident. Although age-related neurodegeneration is a 
common phenomenon in living animals, the cellular and molecular mechanisms 
behind remain poorly understood. Pathways leading to neurodegeneration usually 
diverge from a common starting point, mitochondrial stress, which can serve as a 
potential target for early diagnosis and treatments. Interestingly, the 
evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial prohibitin (PHB) complex is a key 
regulator of ageing and metabolism that has been associated with 
neurodegenerative diseases. However, its role in neurodegeneration is still not 
well characterized. The PHB complex shows protective or toxic effects in 
different genetic and physiological contexts, while mitochondrial and cellular 
stress promote both up and downregulation of PHB expression. With this review we 
aim to shed light into the complex world of PHB's function in neurodegeneration 
by putting together the latest advances in neurodegeneration and mitochondrial 
homeostasis associated with PHB. A better understanding of the role of PHB in 
neurodegeneration will add knowledge to neuron deterioration during ageing and 
help to identify early molecular markers of mitochondrial stress. This review 
will deepen our understanding of age-related neurodegeneration and provide 
questions to be addressed, relevant to human health and to improve the life 
quality of the elderly.

Background. For men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (IRPC), adding 
short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to external beam radiation therapy 
(EBRT) has shown efficacy, but men are often reluctant to accept it because of 
its impact on quality of life. Methods. We conducted time tradeoffs (score of 
1 = perfect health and 0 = death) and probability tradeoffs with patients aged 
51 to 78 y who had received EBRT for IRPC within the past 2 y. Of 40 patients, 
20 had received 6 mo of ADT and 20 had declined. Utility assessments explored 4 
ADT-related side effects: hot flashes, fatigue, loss of libido/erectile 
dysfunction, and weight gain. Results. The most commonly reported "worst" 
treatment-related complication of ADT was fatigue (50% in both cohorts) followed 
by reduced libido/erectile dysfunction (40% in both cohorts). The utilities for 
fatigue were mean = 0.71 and median = 0.92 and for reduced libido/erectile 
dysfunction were mean = 0.81 and median = 0.92. Utilities did not differ 
significantly between cohorts. Assuming a 6-mo course of ADT, men reported being 
willing to trade 3 mo of life expectancy to avoid fatigue due to ADT and 1.8 mo 
to avoid sexual side effects. Patients in the ADT cohort were willing to accept 
the side effects of ADT in exchange for a mean 8% absolute increase in survival, 
whereas patients in the no ADT cohort required a 16% increase (P < 0.001). 
Conclusions. When considering treatment with ADT, men with IRPC identified 
fatigue and sexual dysfunction as the most bothersome side effects. Patients who 
declined ADT expected a larger survival benefit than those who opted for 
treatment. Both groups expected a survival benefit exceeding that shown by 
recent trials, suggesting some men may be selecting treatments inconsistent with 
their preferences.
HIGHLIGHTS: This study demonstrates that prostate cancer patients receiving 
radiation therapy are reluctant to receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) 
most commonly due to anticipated fatigue and loss of libido/erectile 
dysfunction.Men who had received ADT reported they would require an average 8% 
absolute increase in survival to tolerate its side effects, whereas those who 
declined ADT would require an average 16% increase.Required thresholds are well 
above the estimated absolute survival benefit for ADT demonstrated in recent 
clinical trials, suggesting an unmet need for improved patient education 
regarding the risks and benefits of ADT.

On the emergence of the correlation between life expectancy and the variance in 
the age at death.

Recent empirical studies have found various patterns in the correlations between 
lifespan inequality and life expectancy in modern human populations. However, it 
is unclear how general these regularities are. Here we establish three theorems 
that provide theoretical foundations for such regularities. We show that for 
populations with a finite maximum lifespan ω, and under certain continuity 
assumptions, the variance in the age at death is bounded by a function of 
lifespan that has a maximum and tends to zero as life expectancy tends to zero 
and ω. We show how the change in said variance is determined by a particular 
interplay between the coefficient of variation and the mean age in the 
population. These results lead to three hypotheses-a three-phased pattern of 
change for the correlation between the variance and life expectancy, a 
particular shape of the associated variance function, and that survival curve 
Type is one driver of the pattern. We illustrate those hypotheses empirically 
via a study of the 10 countries in the Human Mortality Database with the oldest 
available data. Our results elucidate the emergence of the aforementioned 
correlation patterns and provide demographically meaningful conditions under 
which those correlations reverse.

BACKGROUND: Connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) can 
affect collagen and elastin content and structure, including weakening of 
tissues and vasculature, thus contributing to multiple systemic manifestations. 
Prior research has successfully focused on peripheral life-threatening 
manifestations resulting in increased life expectancy, yet clinical observations 
have warranted investigation of neurological vulnerability, where little is 
known. Compromised brain tissues and cerebrovasculature could leave these 
patients vulnerable to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), with increased 
severity and duration of post-concussive symptoms and delayed recovery. Clinical 
reports in adults indicate that higher severity of symptoms after a mild TBI, 
such as a concussion, can unmask connective tissues disorders leading toward 
diagnosis. This clinical case report is an example of a pediatric patient with 
presumed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome who demonstrates increased vulnerability to mild 
TBI/concussion.
PATIENT: A pediatric female patient presents with unexplained lingering 
post-concussive symptoms, including trouble sleeping, nausea, frontal headaches, 
dizziness, visual changes, fatigue, and left-sided weakness more than 6 months 
post-mild concussion. Patient history of hypermobility, joint derangement, soft 
tissue mobility, and bruising suggests a potential diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome, which may explain symptom severity and length of recovery.
DISCUSSION: This case is the first documented instance of increased 
vulnerability to TBI in a pediatric patient with presumed Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome. It highlights the need for awareness and prevention of injury in this 
vulnerable patient population, suggests more targeted therapeutic intervention 
for recovery, and demonstrates the need for preclinical research evaluating the 
influence of genetic mutations associated with connective tissue disorders on 
the central nervous system.

Microbial stability of fresh pasta depends on heat treatment, storage 
temperature, proper preservatives, and atmosphere packaging. This study aimed at 
improving the microbial quality, safety, and shelf life of fresh pasta using 
modified atmosphere composition and packaging with or without the addition of 
bioprotective cultures (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, 
Bifidobacterium spp., and Bacillus coagulans) into semolina. Three fresh pasta 
variants were made using (i) the traditional protocol (control), MAP (20:80 
CO2:N2), and barrier packaging, (ii) the experimental MAP (40:60 CO2:N2) and 
barrier packaging, and (iii) the experimental MAP, barrier packaging, and 
bioprotective cultures. Their effects on physicochemical properties (i.e., 
content on macro elements, water activity, headspace O2, CO2 concentrations, and 
mycotoxins), microbiological patterns, protein, and volatile organic compounds 
(VOC) were investigated at the beginning and the end of the actual or extended 
shelf-life through traditional and multi-omics approaches. We showed that the 
gas composition and properties of the packaging material tested in the 
experimental MAP system, with or without bioprotective cultures, positively 
affect features of fresh pasta avoiding changes in their main chemical 
properties, allowing for a storage longer than 120 days under refrigerated 
conditions. These results support that, although bioprotective cultures were not 
all able to grow in tested conditions, they can control the spoilage and the 
associated food-borne microbiota in fresh pasta during storage by their 
antimicrobials and/or fermentation products synergically. The VOC profiling, 
based on gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS), highlighted significant 
differences affected by the different manufacturing and packaging of samples. 
Therefore, the use of the proposed MAP system and the addition of bioprotective 
cultures can be considered an industrial helpful strategy to reduce the quality 
loss during refrigerated storage and to increase the shelf life of fresh pasta 
for additional 30 days by allowing the economic and environmental benefits 
spurring innovation in existing production models.

As the world population ages, the burden of age-related health problems grows, 
creating a greater demand for new novel interventions for healthy aging. 
Advancing aging is related to a loss of beneficial mutualistic microbes in the 
gut microbiota caused by extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as diet, sedentary 
lifestyle, sleep deprivation, circadian rhythms, and oxidative stress, which 
emerge as essential elements in controlling and prolonging life expectancy of 
healthy aging. This condition is known as gut dysbiosis, and it affects normal 
brain function via the brain-gut microbiota (BGM) axis, which is a bidirectional 
link between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the central nervous system 
(CNS) that leads to the emergence of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, we reviewed the role of the gut microbiome 
in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as provided a comprehensive 
review of recent findings from preclinical and clinical studies to present an 
up-to-date overview of recent advances in developing strategies to modulate the 
intestinal microbiome by probiotic administration, dietary intervention, fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT), and physical activity to address the aging 
process and prevent neurodegenerative diseases. The findings of this review will 
provide researchers in the fields of aging and the gut microbiome design 
innovative studies that leverage results from preclinical and clinical studies 
to better understand the nuances of aging, gut microbiome, and neurodegenerative 
diseases.

AIMS: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) have a significant impact on a patient's 
quality of life and life expectancy, with mortality rates comparable with 
malignant diseases. However, there is a lack of data regarding palliative care 
needs in this population. We aimed to characterize palliative care needs in 
people under diabetic foot surveillance using the Integrated Palliative care 
Outcome Scale (IPOS) and EuroQol-5D three-level version (EQ-5D-3L) and to assess 
differences between those with and without a DFU.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with consecutive sampling 
inclusion of patients followed in a tertiary hospital's Diabetic Foot Clinic 
between February and October 2019 with (n = 20) and without (n = 42) active DFU.
RESULTS: The most frequent symptoms encountered were pain, weakness or lack of 
energy, sore or dry mouth and drowsiness. Patients with an active DFU were 
significantly more likely to report feeling anxious or worried in comparison 
with those without (95% versus 55%, p = 0.002). Only 10% of the participants 
with an active DFU said that they were always able to share how they felt with 
family and friends as much as they wanted in comparison with 45% of those 
without (p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Our study identified palliative care needs in patients under 
diabetic foot surveillance with and without DFU, including a significant 
presence of physical symptoms. Patients in both groups showed signs of 
emotional/psychological distress, with a higher manifestation in patients with 
DFU. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study addressing and 
characterizing palliative care needs in this population.

Emphysematous cystitis (EC) is a potentially life-threatening urinary tract 
infection (UTI) characterized by the presence of gas within the bladder wall and 
lumen. The extension of gas beyond the bladder wall is rare and indicative of 
severe disease. We present a case of septic shock secondary to EC with the 
extension of air through the paraspinal and psoas muscles and into the epidural 
space of the lumbar spinal canal. This finding of intraspinal air is a rare 
radiographic phenomenon known as pneumorrhachis (PR).

Diabetic heart disease is a major healthcare problem. Patients with diabetes 
show an excess of death from cardiovascular causes, twice as high as the general 
population and those with diabetes type 1 and longer duration of the disease 
present with more severe cardiovascular complications. Premature coronary artery 
disease and heart failure are leading causes of morbidity and reduced life 
expectancy. Multimodality cardiac imaging, including echocardiography, cardiac 
computed tomography, nuclear medicine, and cardiac magnetic resonance play 
crucial role in the diagnosis and management of different pathologies included 
in the definition of diabetic heart disease. In this review we summarise the 
utility of multi-modality cardiac imaging in characterising ischaemic and 
non-ischaemic causes of diabetic heart disease and give an overview of the 
current clinical practice. We also describe emerging imaging techniques enabling 
early detection of coronary artery inflammation and the non-invasive 
characterisation of the atherosclerotic plaque disease. Furthermore, we discuss 
the role of MRI-derived techniques in studying altered myocardial metabolism 
linking diabetes with the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Finally, we 
discuss recent data regarding the use of artificial intelligence applied to 
large imaging databases and how those efforts can be utilised in the future in 
screening of patients with diabetes for early signs of disease.

Ultrasonic washing has been proved to be an abiotic elicitor to induce the 
accumulation of phenolics in some fruit and vegetables. However, the feasibility 
of ultrasonic washing on the accumulation of phenolics in fresh-cut red cabbages 
has not yet been reported. Therefore, the effects of ultrasonic washing on the 
phenolics and related phenolic metabolism enzymes of fresh-cut red cabbages, as 
well as quality and microbial safety during cold storage, were investigated. 
Firstly, the single-factor tests were used to optimize the ultrasonic processing 
parameters, including frequency mode, frequency amplitude, power density, 
frequency cycle time, and ultrasonic washing. Then the activities of the enzymes 
related to phenolic metabolisms after optimal ultrasound treatment were 
investigated, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), polyphenol oxidase 
(PPO), and peroxidase (POD). Additionally, the quality and microbial safety of 
fresh-cut red cabbages stored at 4°C under the optimal ultrasound treatment were 
evaluated. The results showed that the content of soluble phenolics (SPs) in 
fresh-cut red cabbages increased significantly during storage under the optimal 
conditions (28 ± 2 kHz, 60 W/L, 400 ms, and 20 min) compared with the control (P 
< 0.05). The PAL activity was activated and the PPO and POD activities were 
inhibited after ultrasonic washing, which contributed to the increase in the 
content of SPs. Meanwhile, the storage quality and microbial safety of fresh-cut 
red cabbages were improved. Ultrasonic washing reduced the weight loss and 
respiration rate and improved the color and texture characteristics. 
Additionally, the fresh-cut red cabbages after ultrasonic washing showed more 
retention of ascorbic acid (AA), total soluble proteins (TSPs), total soluble 
sugars (TSSs), and total soluble solids (SSs) compared with the control. 
Finally, ultrasonic washing effectively inhibited the growth of bacteria, molds 
and yeasts, which is beneficial to the extension of the shelf-life of fresh-cut 
red cabbages. Therefore, ultrasonic washing can be used as a tool to increase 
the content of SPs in fresh-cut red cabbages while retaining quality attributes 
and microbial safety.

Sustainable increases in crop production require efficient use of resources, and 
intercropping can improve water use efficiency and land productivity at reduced 
inputs. Thus, in a three-year field experiment, the performance of maize/soybean 
strip intercropping system differing with maize plant density (6 maize plants 
m-2, low, D1; 8 maize plants m-2, medium, D2; and 10 maize plants m-2, high, D3) 
was evaluated in comparison with sole maize or soybean cropping system. Results 
revealed that among all intercropping treatments, D2 had a significantly higher 
total leaf area index (maize LAI + soybean LAI; 8.2), total dry matter 
production (maize dry matter + soybean dry matter; 361.5 g plant-1), and total 
grain yield (maize grain yield + soybean grain yield; 10122.5 kg ha-1) than D1 
and D3, and also higher than sole maize (4.8, 338.7 g plant-1, and 9553.7 kg 
ha-1) and sole soybean (4.6, 64.8 g plant-1, and 1559.5 kg ha-1). The 
intercropped maize was more efficient in utilizing the radiation and water, with 
a radiation use efficiency of 3.5, 5.2, and 4.3 g MJ-1 and water use efficiency 
of 14.3, 16.2, and 13.3 kg ha-1 mm-1, while that of intercropped soybean was 
2.5, 2.1, and 1.8 g MJ-1 and 2.1, 1.9, and 1.5 kg ha-1 mm-1 in D1, D2, and D3, 
respectively. In intercropping, the land and water equivalent ratios ranged from 
1.22 to 1.55, demonstrating that it is a sustainable strategy to improve land 
and water use efficiencies; this maximization is likely associated with the 
species complementarities for radiation, water, and land in time and space, 
which resulted in part from competition avoidance responses that maximize the 
economic profit (e. g., 1300 US $ ha-1 in D2) over sole maize (798 US $ ha-1) or 
sole soybean (703 US $ ha-1). Overall, these results indicate that optimizing 
strip intercropping systems can save 20-50% of water and land, especially under 
the present scenario of limited resources and climate change. However, further 
research is required to fully understand the resource capture mechanisms of 
intercrops in intercropping.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a systemic disease with a major 
burden on several life aspects, including oral health. As life expectancy has 
improved in CKD patients, oral health status has become important regarding 
their quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate oral health and 
oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in CKD patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Patients' age, gender, 
and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) stage were recorded. Oral Health 
Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) was used to evaluate OHRQoL. Decayed, missing, and 
filled teeth (DMFT) index was utilized to record oral health status. SPSS 
software was used to analyze data. One-way ANOVA, t-test and Pearson/Spearman 
correlations were used. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: One hundred and four patients participated; 60.6% male versus 39.4% 
female. Mean age was 52.1 ± 18.1 years. The most frequent eGFR stage was 5 
(41.2%). Mean DMFT score was 18.7 ± 8.5. Mean OHIP-14 score was 14.82 ± 5.86. 
DMFT score was significantly correlated with OHIP-14 total score as well as its 
physical domains (P < 0.05). The correlation between eGFR stage and OHIP-14/DMFT 
score was both statistically significant (P = 0.03/P = 0.02, respectively).
CONCLUSION: DMFT score was significantly correlated with OHRQoL in CKD patients, 
especially regarding its physical domains. Paying attention to fulfill dental 
treatment needs seems mandatory to improve OHRQoL and overall quality of life in 
these patients.

How working-age population education and health of older people shape the burden 
of population aging: A comparative study of Macau, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

Macau, Hong Kong and Singapore are all facing increasing population aging. Those 
aged 65 and over make up the old-age population. The working-age population 
refers to the population aged 15 to 64. Conventionally, the burden of population 
aging is measured by the Old-Age Dependency Ratio, which is the ratio of the 
old-age population to the working-age population. As life expectancy rises, 
depending exclusively on age to calculate the burden of aging hinders the 
development of effective anti-aging strategies. The working-age population's 
education and the elderly's health affect the aging burden's support and 
generator, respectively. Including them in the calculation gives us a fuller
