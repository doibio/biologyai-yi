BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine the descriptive epidemiology and trends in the 
burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 dataset. 
Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to assess the trends 
in incidence rate, mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
associated with T2DM. Measures were stratified by sex, region, country, age and 
social development index (SDI) value.
RESULTS: The global age-standardized incidence rate of T2DM increased from 1990 
to 2019, with an EAPC of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.19 to 1.31). In 2019, the highest 
age-standardized incidence rate of T2DM was observed in high-SDI regions, and 
the largest increase in this rate from 1990 to 2019 was also in high-SDI regions 
(EAPC, 1.74;95% CI, 1.57 to 1.90). At the regional level, Central Asia (EAPC, 
2.53;95% CI, 2.45 to 2.61) had the largest increase in the age-standardized 
incidence rate of T2DM from 1990 to 2019. At the national level, Luxembourg 
(EAPC, 4.51;95% CI, 4.37 to 4.65) and Uzbekistan (EAPC, 3.63; 95% CI, 3.44 to 
3.82) had the largest increases in the age-standardized incidence rate of T2DM 
from 1990 to 2019. The global age-standardized death and DALY rates increased 
from 1990 to 2019, with EAPCs of 0.26 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.37) and 0.81 (95% CI, 
0.77 to 0.85), respectively. The age-standardized death and DALY rates showed 
the largest increases in Central Asia, South Asia and Southern Sub-Saharan 
Africa.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, the age-standardized incidence, death and DALY rates 
increased from 1990 to 2019. Central Asia, South Asia and Southern Sub-Saharan 
Africa were found to have the greatest burden of T2DM. Future strategies should 
focus on these high-risk regions and other high-risk populations.

Mild to Moderate Hip Osteoarthritis.

Hip Osteoarthritis (HOA) is a common joint disease with serious impact on the 
quality of life of the affected persons. Additionally, persons with HOA often 
show alterations in gait biomechanics. Developing effective conservative 
treatment strategies is of paramount importance, as joint replacement is only 
indicated for end-stage HOA. In contrast to knee osteoarthritis, little is known 
about the effectiveness of hip bracing for the management of HOA. Studies 
analysing mechanically unloading hip braces partly showed beneficial results. 
However, methodological limitations of these studies, such as small sample sizes 
or lack of control groups, limit the applicability of the results. Additionally, 
mechanically unloading braces might impose restrictions on motion and comfort 
and thus, might not be suitable for people with only mild or moderate symptoms. 
The aim of this study was to comprehensively quantify the effects of unilateral 
HOA as well as functional hip bracing on gait biomechanics, pain, proprioception 
and functional capacity in people with mild to moderate HOA. Hip and pelvis 
biomechanics during walking were analysed in 21 subjects with mild to moderate 
HOA under three bracing conditions: unbraced, immediately after brace 
application and after 1 week of brace usage. Additionally, pain, hip 
proprioception and functional capacity were assessed. A matched group of 21 
healthy subjects was included as reference. Kinematic and kinetic data were 
collected using a 16-camera infrared motion capturing system and two force 
plates. Visual analogue scales, an angle reproduction test and a 6-min walking 
test were applied to measure pain, hip proprioception and functional capacity, 
respectively. Subjects with HOA walked slower, with reduced step length, 
sagittal hip range of motion and peak extension angle and had a reduced 
functional capacity. After 1 week of brace application step length, walking 
speed and functional capacity were significantly increased. Additionally, pain 
perception was significantly lower in the intervention period. These results 
encourage the application of functional hip braces in the management of mild to 
moderate HOA. However, as key parameters of HOA gait such as a reduced peak 
extension angle remained unchanged, the underlying mechanisms remain partly 
unclear and have to be considered in the future.

recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer: a model-based economic 
evaluation for China.

BACKGROUND: HLX02 is a newly marketed trastuzumab biosimilar in China, but 
whether its price reflects a potential benefit in terms of its value remains 
unclear. In addition, the development of biosimilars in China is just beginning, 
and the state encourages health economic evaluation of newly marketed 
biosimilars.
METHODS: Based on the previously published randomized controlled trial data, a 
Markov model was used to perform health economic evaluation of HLX02 and 
trastuzumab in the treatment of HER2-positive recurrent or metastatic breast 
cancer, calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and evaluate the robustness of the model with 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The model results showed that the 5-year mortality rate was 84.4% in 
the HLX02 group, while the mortality rate was 91.2% in the trastuzumab group. 
When without accounting for the cost of second-line treatment, patients treated 
with HLX02 had an increased life expectancy of 0.138 QALYs and a $421.11 lower 
cost compared with patients in the trastuzumab group, with an ICER value of 
-$3,051.52/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: At the willingness-to-pay threshold of $37,653/QALY in China, HLX02 
is more cost-effective than trastuzumab. However, the relevant systems for the 
regulation of biosimilars still need to be improved.

Plain Language Summary: Metastatic HER-2 positive breast cancer poses a 
considerable cost to society due to limitations in health care resources. HLX02 
is the first trastuzumab biosimilar produced in China and evaluated worldwide, 
and its emergence has opened the door to trastuzumab biosimilars in China. 
Although HLX02 has been shown to be clinically equivalent to the original drug 
in the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, it remains unclear 
whether its price reflects the potential benefit in terms of its value. In 
addition, the development of biosimilars in China is just beginning, and the 
state encourages health economic evaluation of newly marketed biosimilars. Based 
on the results of Markov model, at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$37,653/QALY in China, HLX02 is more cost-effective than trastuzumab under the 
condition of equivalent efficacy and safety. However, it remains challenging to 
adjust the development of the regulation of biosimilars, such as the price 
difference between biosimilars and original drugs.

The written discharge summary is the main vector of communication and serves as 
a critical method of patient information transfer between hospitalist and 
primary care provider. It is a shown challenge to timely delivery and 
completeness of a discharge letter, especially when it involves patients in 
palliative care or with a limited life expectancy. Despite the implementation of 
standardized letters and guidelines. Personalized interactive information 
transfer of hospital discharge summary between hospitalist and primary care 
provider should include a written as well as the strong consideration of an oral 
transmission. This should ensure continuity of care and limit deficiencies in 
content and availability of critical medical information. Joint responsibility 
of continuous care instead of simply a transfer.

Bartolomei, S, De Luca, R, and Marcora, SM. May a nonlocalized postactivation 
performance enhancement exist between the upper and lower body in trained men? J 
Strength Cond Res 37(1): 68-73, 2023-The aim of this study was to establish 
whether a resistance exercise for the upper body may generate a postactivation 
performance enhancement (PAPE) in the lower body. Thirteen resistance-trained 
men (age = 26.4 ± 3.3 years, body mass = 76.9 ± 6.3 kg, and height = 177.6 ± 5.2 
cm) participated in the present investigation and were tested for upper-body and 
lower-body power (bench press throw and countermovement jump power [CMJP] 
tests). Subjects were also tested for maximum force and electromyographic (EMG) 
activation of quadriceps muscles while performing an isometric leg extension. 
All assessments were performed before and 8 minutes after a high-intensity (HI: 
5 sets of 1 rep at 90% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) bench press protocol, a 
high-power protocol (POW: 5 sets of 1 rep at 30% of 1RM with maximum explosive 
intent), and a control trial (CON). Subjects performed all trials in a 
randomized order and on different days. A significant trial × time interaction 
was detected for CMJP ( p = 0.049). This parameter was significantly increased 
following the HI protocol only ( p = 0.024). A significant interaction was also 
noted for EMG with a significant improvement following the HI protocol ( p = 
0.032) and a significant decrease following the POW protocol ( p = 0.020). No 
other significant effects were detected ( p > 0.05). The results of this 
investigation indicate that a HI bench press protocol may produce a PAPE in the 
lower-body power and increase the neuromuscular activation of leg extensor 
muscles. The POW bench press protocol did not show any positive effects on 
lower-body performance. Athletes and practitioners may take advantage from the 
inclusion of upper-body HI resistance exercises throughout complex resistance 
workouts to improve lower-body power output.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the WISDOM self-management 
intervention for type 2 diabetes compared with care as usual.
DESIGN: We performed a difference-in-differences analysis to estimate 
differences in risk factors for diabetes complications between people in the 
WISDOM group (n = 25, 276) and a control group (n = 15, 272) using GP records. A 
decision analytic model was then used to extrapolate differences in risk factors 
into costs and outcomes in the long term.
SETTING: Participating GP practices in West Hampshire and Southampton, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: All people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes between January 1990 and 
March 2020 (n = 40,548).
OUTCOMES: Diabetes-related complications, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and costs to the English National Health Service at 5 years and lifetime.
INTERVENTIONS: The WISDOM intervention included risk stratification, 
self-management education programme to professionals and people with type 2 
diabetes, and monitoring of key treatment targets.
RESULTS: WISDOM was associated with less atrial fibrillation [p = 0.001], 
albuminuria [p = 0.002] and blood pressure [p = 0.098]. Among all people in the 
intervention group, WISDOM led to 51 [95%CI: 25; 76] QALYs gained and saved 
£278,036 [95%CI: -631,900; 176,392] in the first 5 years after its 
implementation compared with care as usual. During those people' lifetime, 
WISDOM led to 253 [95%CI: 75; 404] QALYs gained and cost saving of £126,380 
[95%CI: -1,466,008; 1,339,628]. The gains in QALYs were a result of reduced 
diabetes-related complications through improved management of the associated 
risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The WISDOM risk-stratification and education intervention for type 
2 diabetes appear to be cost-effective compared to usual care by reducing 
diabetes complications.

[From the pragmatic use of traditional medicine by the health sector to the 
ideological exclusion of anthropological perspectives: the case of Mexico 
(1930-2022)].

This article analyzes two general lines of research on traditional medicine used 
by Mexican indigenous peoples since the 15th century up to the present day. The 
first - pioneered by anthropologists and physicians with anthropological 
training - addresses traditional medicine so as to promote biomedicine among 
indigenous groups, with the purpose of improving their health conditions. This 
line of research developed between the 1930s and 1960s, reemerged in the 
mid-1970s with the Alma Ata Conference, and has maintained momentum into the 
present day, seeking to expand coverage of the health sector in marginalized 
areas, but while subordinating traditional medicine to biomedical programs in 
all aspects. The second line of research has been fostered by anthropologists, 
in particular from the 1960s onward, and seeks to comprehend indigenous cultures 
through traditional medicine, with a particular focus on healers, who express 
the cosmovision, identity, sense of belonging, and cultural autonomy of 
indigenous peoples. However, these enquiries attempt to comprehend and validate 
the ways in which traditional medicine encapsulates cultural identity, and in 
some cases to justify political, economic, and above all ideological objectives. 
These perspectives do not take into consideration information regarding 
morbility, mortality, and life expectancy, despite the fact that indigenous 
peoples are the social group with the highest mortality rates and lowest life 
expectancy.

Publisher: Este trabajo analiza dos líneas básicas de estudios que se centran en 
la medicina tradicional utilizada por los pueblos originarios mexicanos desde el 
siglo XV hasta la actualidad. La primera, impulsada por antropólogos y médicos 
con formación antropológica, aborda la medicina tradicional para impulsar la 
biomedicina en los pueblos indígenas, procurando mejorar sus condiciones de 
salud. Esta línea se desarrolló entre las décadas de 1930 y 1960, para 
reaparecer a mediados de 1970 a partir de la Conferencia de Alma Ata, y se 
mantuvo hasta la actualidad buscando expandir la cobertura de atención del 
sector salud en áreas marginadas, pero supeditando la medicina tradicional, en 
todos los aspectos, a los programas biomédicos. La segunda línea, ha sido 
impulsada por antropólogos, sobre todo desde la década de 1960, buscando 
comprender las culturas originarias a través de la medicina tradicional y de lxs 
curadorxs, que expresan la cosmovisión, identidad, pertenencia y autonomía 
cultural de los pueblos originarios. Pero esta búsqueda la realizan tratando de 
comprender y revalidar el papel de identificador cultural de la medicina 
tradicional y, en algunas orientaciones, justificar objetivos 
económico-políticos y, especialmente, ideológicos. Esto lo hacen excluyendo la 
información sobre morbilidad, mortalidad y esperanza de vida, pese a que los 
pueblos originarios constituyen el sector social con mayores tasas de mortalidad 
y menor esperanza de vida.

This article investigates alcohol consumption attributable burden of diseases. 
The present study considers the overall effect of Human Development Index (HDI), 
Socio Demographic Index (SDI) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for income to 
measure how these variables impact Global Burden of Diseases (GDB), bringing a 
different perspective to the results. Data from over 177 countries mainly 
including European, Asian, North American, South American, African and 
Australian regions were analysed from 2000 to 2019. A Panel regression technique 
was applied, and Fixed Effects (FE) and Random Effects (RE) estimations were 
chosen to derive outcomes of the Hausman test. The findings reflected that 
alcohol consumption (wine, beer, spirit and other alcohol) has a positive 
significant relationship with the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) globally and 
in the African continent excluding North America and South America. Human 
Development Index (HDI) have a negative impact on GBD on all countries. 
Particularly HDI have a negative impact on GBD in African continent except other 
continents. Also, in the African continent and globally, GBD has a significant 
positive and in Europe, a significant negative impact on the Socio Demographic 
Index (SDI). The findings demonstrate the overall picture of the impact of 
alcohol consumption and other variables on GBD and provide suggestions on how 
these variables should be tackled in the future to reduce GBD. This is the 
initial empirical study that investigates the impact of alcohol consumption, 
analysing the combined effect of HDI, SDI and income on the GBD of continent 
wise and globally.

Continuous reduction in the levelized cost of energy is driving the rapid 
development of offshore wind energy (OWE). It is thus important to evaluate, 
from an environmental perspective, the implications of expanding OWE capacity on 
a global scale. Nevertheless, this assessment must take into account various 
scenarios for the growth of different OWE technologies in the near future. To 
evaluate the environmental impacts of future OWE development, this paper 
conducts a prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) including parameterized 
supply chains with high technology resolution. Results show that OWE-related 
environmental impacts, including climate change, marine ecotoxicity, marine 
eutrophication, and metal depletion, are reduced by ∼20% per MWh from 2020 to 
2040 due to various developments including size expansion, lifetime extension, 
and technology innovation. At the global scale, 2.6-3.6 Gt CO2 equiv of 
greenhouse gas emissions are emitted cumulatively due to OWE deployment from 
2020 to 2040. The manufacturing of primary raw materials, such as steel and 
fibers, is the dominant contributor to impacts. Overall, 6-9% of the cumulative 
OWE-related environmental impacts could be reduced by end-of-life (EoL) 
recycling and the substitution of raw materials.

Climate warming has significantly altered the phenology of plants in recent 
decades. However, in contrast to the widely reported warming-induced extension 
of vegetative growing season, the response of fruit development period (FDP) 
from flowering to fruiting remains largely unexplored, particularly for woody 
plants. Analyzing >560,000 in situ observations of both flowering and fruiting 
dates for six temperate woody species across 2958 European phenological 
observations sites during 1980-2013, we found that in all species both flowering 
and fruiting phenology, that is, the FDP, advanced with climate warming. 
However, the advancing rates of the two events were not necessarily equal for 
any given species, resulting in divergent changes in the length of FDP among 
species with climate warming. During 1980-2013, not only the temperature during 
FDP but also the forcing requirement for fruit development increased, both 
affecting the length of FDP. The shortened FDP was mainly due to elevated 
temperature, thus accelerating the accumulation of forcing, whereas the 
prolonged FDP was primarily caused by the substantial increase of the forcing 
requirement of fruiting, which could be fulfilled only in a longer time and thus 
slowed down the advance of fruiting. This study provides large-scale empirical 
evidence of warming-induced advances of FDP but divergent changes in its length 
in temperate woody species. Our findings demonstrate the contrasting 
reproductive phenological strategies among temperate woody species under the 
pressure of warming climate, contrary to the lengthening of vegetative growing 
season, which is by and largely similar with different woody species.

OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Indonesia, with 
Indonesia's breast cancer mortality rate being the highest among Southeast Asian 
countries. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impacts 
of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for 
HER2-positive breast cancer patients in Indonesia.
METHODS: We performed a Markov model-based economic evaluation to assess 
cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and budget impact. Utility data, direct 
medical costs, and indirect costs were obtained primarily from interviewing 
patients. Clinical effectiveness data, on the other hand, were obtained from 
systematic reviews and real-world data and represented through progression free 
survival, overall survival, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULT: From a healthcare provider's perspective, the total costs for the 
combined group were USD 14,516, while chemotherapy alone cost USD 7,489. While 
the cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the combination group had a higher 
total cost by USD 7,027, PFS was longer in the chemotherapy alone group, with a 
difference of 2.2 months. The ICER was USD 17,307 for every QALY gained. The 
total cost of adding trastuzumab over a 5-year period was USD 589 million.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this economic evaluation suggests that the addition 
of trastuzumab to standard chemotherapy is not cost-effective in terms of PFS 
and OS compared with chemotherapy alone.<br />.

COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease, which has caught the world by surprise. 
Millions of people suffer from illness, and the mortality rates are dramatically 
high. Currently, there is no specific and immediate treatment for this disease. 
Remedies are limited to supportive regiments and few antiviral and 
anti-inflammatory drugs. The lack of a definite cure for COVID-19 is the reason 
behind its high mortality and global prevalence. COVID-19 can lead to a critical 
illness with severe respiratory distress and cytokine release. Increased 
oxidative stress and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines are vital 
components of severe COVID-19. Micronutrients, metalloids, and vitamins such as 
iron, manganese, selenium, Zinc, Copper, vitamin A, B family, and C are among 
the essential and trace elements that play a pivotal role in human nutrition and 
health. They participate in metabolic processes that lead to energy production. 
In addition, they support immune functions and act as antioxidants. Therefore, 
maintaining an optimal level of micronutrients intake, particularly those with 
antioxidant activities, is essential to fight against oxidative stress, modulate 
inflammation, and boost the immune system. Therefore, these factors could play a 
crucial role in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. In this review, we aimed to 
summarize antiviral properties of different vitamins and minerals. Moreover, we 
will investigate the correlation between them and their effects in COVID-19 
patients.

Objective.Exercise-induced muscle fatigue is a complex physiological phenomenon 
involving the central and peripheral nervous systems, and fatigue tolerance 
varies across individuals. Various studies have emphasized the close 
relationships between muscle fatigue and the brain. However, the relationships 
between the resting-state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) brain network and 
individual muscle fatigue tolerance remain unexplored.Approach.Eighteen elite 
water polo athletes took part in our experiment. Five-minute before- and 
after-fatigue-exercise rsEEG and fatiguing task (i.e. elbow flexion and 
extension) electromyography (EMG) data were recorded. Based on the graph theory, 
we constructed the before- and after-task rsEEG coherence network and compared 
the network differences between them. Then, the correlation between the 
before-fatigue rsEEG network properties and the EMG fatigue indexes when a 
subject cannot keep on exercising anymore was profiled. Finally, a prediction 
model based on the before-fatigue rsEEG network properties was established to 
predict fatigue tolerance.Main results. Results of this study revealed the 
significant differences between the before- and after-exercise rsEEG brain 
network and found significant high correlations between before-exercise rsEEG 
network properties in the beta band and individual muscle fatigue tolerance. 
Finally, an efficient support vector regression (SVR) model based on the 
before-exercise rsEEG network properties in the beta band was constructed and 
achieved the accurate prediction of individual fatigue tolerance. Similar 
results were also revealed on another 30 subject swimmer data set further 
demonstrating the reliability of predicting fatigue tolerance based on the rsEEG 
network.Significance.Our study investigates the relationship between the rsEEG 
brain network and individual muscle fatigue tolerance and provides a potential 
objective physiological biomarker for tolerance prediction and the regulation of 
muscle fatigue.

The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development must address the 
balance between sustainable growth and tackling climate change. In this context, 
forests can help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, unfortunately, 
equivalent solutions in the ocean are often overlooked. Moreover, the complexity 
in determining the real impact of fishing on the environment is not a trivial 
issue. Thus, the aim of this study is to broaden the scope and analyse, for the 
first time, the entire carbon cycle associated with the life cycle of a fish: 
Scomber scombrus from a fishery located in the Cantabrian Sea (Spain). From this 
carbon cycle assessment, it is estimated that fishing activity has prevented 
871.7 t of carbon (in terms of blue carbon) from being sequestered each year. 
This value comes from the fraction of fish that would have died of natural 
causes if they had not been caught, reaching the seabed, and undergoing 
remineralisation processes of the carbon content of their bodies. Beyond these 
results, it is vital to implement a series of actions with the aim of 
counteracting the amount of carbon that could have been sequestered on the 
seabed by the natural death of the fishes if they had not been caught. To this 
end, it is shown that the implementation of technical improvements to the 
vessels, the replacement of the current fuel used and the rearrangement of 
shipping routes in combination with an extension in the closed fishing season 
and a commitment to an omnivorous diet, allows for a reduction in carbon flow of 
almost 90 % of the blue carbon that has been prevented from being sequestered by 
fisheries. A consequential approach can then identify the influence of the 
proposed changes on their corresponding carbon flows for use as decision 
criteria in regulating fisheries and environmental management policies.

OBJECTIVE: To project future trajectories of the gastric cancer (GC) burden in 
China under different scenarios of GC prevention and identify strategies to 
improve affordability and cost-effectiveness.
DESIGN: Using a cohort of Chinese men and women born during 1951-1980, we 
assumed that different prevention strategies were conducted, including 
eradication of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and endoscopy screening (one-time, 
annual, biennial, triennial or stratified according to personal risk). We 
performed a literature search to identify up-to-date data and populate a Markov 
model to project the number of new GC cases and deaths during 2021-2035, as well 
as resource requirements and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We examined 
the impacts of general (among the whole population) and targeted (high-risk 
population) prevention.
RESULTS: During 2021-2035, 10.0 million new GC cases and 5.6 million GC deaths 
would occur, with 7.6%-35.5% and 6.9%-44.5%, respectively, being avoidable 
through various prevention strategies. Relative to the status quo, Hp 
eradication was a cost-saving strategy. General annual screening dominated other 
screening strategies, but cost more than CNY 70 000 per QALY gained 
(willingness-to-pay) compared with Hp eradication. Among endoscopy strategies, 
targeted screening resulted in 44%-49% lower cost per QALY gained over the 
status quo than general screening. Among high-risk population, tailoring the 
screening frequency according to personal risk could reduce endoscopy-related 
resources by 22% compared with biennial screening and by 55% compared with 
annual screening, CONCLUSION: Our findings provide important input for future 
decision-making and investment, highlighting the need and feasibility for China 
to include GC prevention in its national health plans.

INTRODUCTION: Long finger skeletal fractures are common injuries. In displaced 
forms, surgical treatment is required. With the advent of headless cannulated 
screws, the technique has been simplified and allows reduction in both planes. 
The objective of our study was to evaluate the functional recovery of patients 
operated on by this technique.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: We conducted a retrospective single-center study between 
2019 and 2022. Eleven patients were followed and 12 fractures analyzed. A 
radio-clinical follow-up was carried out at 1 month then at the last follow-up 
with an evaluation of the articular amplitudes and a quality of life score 
(QuickDash, QD). The time to return to professional and sporting activities, 
pain (EVA) was collected. An anatomical/scannographic evaluation was performed 
to assess tendon and cartilage damage.
RESULTS: At the last follow-up, the average global flexion was 266° and the 
extension was total. An average QD score of 15.9 and a Jamar force of 106% 
compared to the healthy side were observed. The return to physical and 
professional activities was earlier and the pain quickly tolerable. No secondary 
displacement was objectified and all were consolidated at the last follow-up, 
without malunion. No patient had been operated on secondarily.
CONCLUSION: This technique seems to be a safe and non-traumatic. It allows a 
faster return to sports and professional activities with fewer complications and 
no need to remove the material.

The possibility of predicting the specific features of forthcoming environmental 
events is fundamental for our survival since it allows us to proactively 
regulate our behaviour, enhancing our chance of survival. This is particularly 
crucial for stimuli providing socially relevant information for communication 
and interaction, such as faces. While it has been consistently demonstrated that 
the human brain shows preferential and ontogenetically early face-evoked 
activity, it is unknown whether specialized neural routes are engaged by 
face-predictive activity early in life. In this study, we recorded high-density 
electrophysiological (ERP) activity in adults and 9- and 4-month-old infants 
undergoing an audio-visual paradigm purposely designed to predict the appearance 
of faces or objects starting from congruent auditory cues (i.e., human voice vs 
nonhuman sounds). Contingent negative variation or CNV was measured to 
investigate anticipatory activity as a reliable marker of stimulus expectancy 
even in the absence of explicit motor demand. The results suggest that CNV can 
also be reliably elicited in the youngest group of 4-month-old infants, 
providing further evidence that expectation-related anticipatory activity is an 
intrinsic, early property of the human cortex. Crucially, the findings also 
indicate that the predictive information provided by the cue (i.e., human voice 
vs nonhuman sounds) turns into the recruitment of different anticipatory neural 
dynamics for faces and objects.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with 
significant mortality and well-defined aetiological factors. Previous reports 
indicate that mortality from COPD is falling worldwide. This study aims to 
assess the burden of COPD using prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) between 2001 and 2019 in 28 European countries (the European 
Union and the United Kingdom).
METHODS: We extracted COPD data from the Global Burden of Disease database based 
on the International Classification of Diseases versions 10 (J41, 42, 43, 44 and 
47). Age-standardised prevalence rates (ASPRs), age-standardised mortality rates 
(ASMRs), and DALYs were analysed for European countries by sex for each year 
(2001-2019) and reported per 100,000 population. We used Joinpoint regression 
analysis to quantify changing trends in the burden of COPD.
RESULTS: In 2019, the median ASPR across Europe was 3230/100,000 for males and 
2202/100,000 for females. Between 2001 and 2019, the median percentage change in 
ASPR was - 9.7% for males and 4.3% for females. 23/28 countries demonstrated a 
decrease in ASPRs in males, and 11/28 demonstrated a decrease in females. The 
median percentage change in ASMR between 2001 and 2019 was - 27.5% for males 
and - 10.4% for females. 25/28 and 19/28 countries demonstrated a decrease in 
ASMR in males and females, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In the EU between 2001 and 2019 COPD prevalence has overall 
increased in females but continues to decrease in males and in some countries, 
female prevalence now exceeds that of males. COPD mortality in the EU has 
decreased overall between 2001 and 2019; however, this decrease is not 
universal, particularly in females, and therefore remains a substantial source 
of amenable mortality.

BACKGROUND: Physical independence is crucial for overall health in the elderly 
individuals. The life expectancy of women has been shown to be higher than that 
of men, which is also known as the "male-female health-survival paradox". Sex 
hormones may be one of the explanations. However, the relationships between sex 
hormones and physical function remain unclear in the elderly females. This study 
was designed to explore these relationships among the Chinese oldest-old and 
centenarian women.
METHODS: Data from 1226 women were obtained from the China Hainan Centenarian 
Cohort Study. Home interviews, physical examinations and blood analyses were 
conducted using standardized procedures. Variables including age, Han ethnicity, 
illiteracy, smoker, drinker, estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), 
follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone were used in the 
multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses.
RESULTS: In all the participants, age [beta (95% confidence interval): - 0.84 
(- 0.98, - 0.71)] and E2 levels [beta (95% confidence interval): - 0.22 (- 0.28, 
- 0.17)] were negatively associated with activities of daily living (ADLs) in 
the multivariate linear regression analyses (P < 0.05 for all). We also observed 
significantly negative associations of age [odds ratio (95% confidence 
interval): 0.90 (0.88, 0.91)] and E2 levels [odds ratio (95% confidence 
interval): 0.98 (0.98, 0.99)] with physical normality in the multivariate 
logistic regression analyses (P < 0.05 for all). Age and E2 levels gradually 
decreased with increases in the ADL quartiles across all the participants 
(P < 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that E2 levels were negatively associated 
with physical function among the Chinese oldest-old and centenarian women.
