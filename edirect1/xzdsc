BACKGROUND: The objectives of the present study were to explore the 
epidemiological characteristics of hypertension among rural older adults in 
resource-limited regions, and then evaluate the loss of health-adjusted life 
expectancy due to hypertension.
METHODS: Participants aged between 60 and 79 years were enrolled from Henan 
rural cohort study. The prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of 
hypertension were detailed across subgroups. Variances within subgroups were 
identified via Student's t tests or one-way ANOVA for continuous variables and 
chi-squared tests for categorical ones, and logistic regression model was 
employed to detect the potential influencing factors. The health-adjusted life 
expectancy was calculated by the Sullivan method with EuroqOL-5D data.
RESULTS: Among 16,785 participants, 7,472 (44.52%) were attacked by 
hypertension, 4,858 (65.02%) had been already aware of their condition, 4,009 
(53.65%) were taking antihypertensive medication for treatment, while only 1,478 
(19.78%) had their hypertension controlled. The prevalence of hypertension was 
significantly higher among women than men and it increased with age for both 
genders. For the older ones aged 60 years, the life expectancy was 22.0872 years 
and the health-adjusted life expectancy was 15.5578 and 15.9418 for those with 
or without hypertension, respectively. Namely, in this particular age group, 
subjects without hypertension could gain 0.3840 years of health-adjusted life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hypertension was relatively high while the 
awareness, treatment, and control were fairly low. The health-adjusted life 
expectancy of older adults in resource-limited areas could increase from the 
reduction of hypertension. There is an urgent need for strategies pertaining to 
the prevention and treatment of hypertension.

INTRODUCTION: Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a common malignancy 
amongst elderly. Increasing life expectancy, prevalence of smoking, lifelong 
exposure to environmental pollutants and immunosenescence contribute to growing 
number of cases. Traditionally, radical cystectomy (RC) with pelvic lymph node 
dissection (PLND) constituted the mainstay of treatment for MIBC, but despite 
proven feasibility in elderly population, it has been associated with 
significant burden of morbidity, mortality, and complications.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: We aimed to re-evaluate the safety and efficacy of RC amongst 
the elderly patients with MIBC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This single-center, retrospective, observational 
comparative study was conducted among 568 patients who underwent RC due to MIBC 
between 2003 and 2021. We evaluated the influence of chronological age (<70 vs 
≥70 years) on clinical, demographic, and pathological variables related to MIBC 
and RC.
RESULTS: Elderly patients had similar clinical and pathological features of 
disease compared to their younger counterparts; nonetheless, they more often 
received simplified urinary diversion, ie ureterostomy (60.25% vs 39.33%, 
p<0.001) and had no PLND (15.76% vs 8.5%, p=0.01) during RC. Furthermore, more 
elderly patients were treated for secondary MIBCs and fewer had history of 
smoking. Severe complication and 90-day mortality rates were comparable between 
groups; however, the elderly had significantly higher all-cause mortality at one 
year post RC (46.67% vs 33.25%, p=0.003). On multivariate analysis, one-year 
mortality risk was independently associated with elderly age (HR=2.119, 95% CI: 
1.227-3.660, p=0.007), rural residency (HR=1.760, 95% CI: 1.043-2.968, p=0.034), 
extravesical extension of tumor (HR=2.109, 95% CI: 1.155-3.850, p=0.015), lymph 
node metastasis (HR=2.268, 95% CI: 1.290-3.987, p=0.004) and omission of PLND 
(HR=6.064, 95% CI: 2.926-12.568, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Radical cystectomy in elderly patients is associated with 
significant one-year mortality. Our study emphasizes the unmet need for 
considerate planning of treatment for MIBC in potentially vulnerable groups of 
elderly patients. Efforts are needed to reliably identify those unlikely to 
benefit from surgery and facilitate patient-centered choice of alternative 
therapies.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased life expectancy and 
consequently the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults living with HIV. 
We investigated the levels and predictors of arterial stiffness in young people 
(YP) living with perinatal HIV (PHIV) and HIV negative YP in the Adolescents and 
Adults Living with Perinatal HIV (AALPHI) study.
METHODS: AALPHI was a prospective study evaluating the impact of HIV infection 
and exposure to ART on YP living with PHIV (aged 13-21 years) who had known 
their HIV status for at least 6 months, and HIV negative YP (aged 13-23 years) 
who either had a sibling, friend or parent living with HIV. Participants were 
enrolled from HIV clinics and community services in England. Two hundred and 
thirteen PHIV and 65 HIV negative YP (42% siblings of PHIV) had pulse wave 
velocity (PWV) measurements taken (Vicorder software) from the supra-sternal 
notch to the middle of the thigh cuff, at their second interview in the study 
between 2015 and 2017. Average PWV was calculated from the three closest 
readings (≥3 and ≤ 12 m/s) within 0.6 m/s of each other. Linear regression 
examined predictors of higher (worse) PWV, including age, sex, HIV status and 
height as a priori, ethnicity, born outside UK/Ireland, alcohol/nicotine/drug 
use, weight, waist-to-hip-ratio, mean arterial pressure (MAP), caffeine 2 h 
before PWV and nicotine on day of PWV. A separate PHIV model included CD4, viral 
load, years taking ART and ART regimen.
FINDINGS: One hundred and twenty eight (60%) PHIV and 45 (69%) HIV negative YP 
were female (p = 0.18), with median (IQR) age 18 (16, 20) and 18 (16, 21) years 
(p = 0.48) respectively. Most PHIV were taking a combination of three ART drugs 
from two classes. There was a trend toward higher (worse) mean PWV in the PHIV 
group than the HIV negative group [unvariable analysis 6.15 (SD 0.83) m/s vs. 
5.93 (0.70) m/s, respectively, unadjusted p = 0.058], which was statistically 
significant in the multivariable analysis [adjusted p (ap) = 0.020]. In 
multivariable analysis being male (ap = 0.002), older age (ap < 0.001), higher 
MAP (ap < 0.001) and nicotine use on day of measurement (ap = 0.001) were also 
predictors of higher PWV. The predictors were the same in the PHIV model.
INTERPRETATION: By late adolescence PHIV had worse PWV in comparison to HIV 
negative peers, and traditional risk factors for CVD (higher arterial pressure, 
being male and older age) were associated with higher PWV values. Regular 
detailed monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors should become standard of 
care for every young person with PHIV worldwide.

Centrioles are subcellular organelles essential for normal cell function and 
development; they form the cell's centrosome (a major cytoplasmic microtubule 
organization center) and cilium (a sensory and motile hair-like cellular 
extension). Centrioles with evolutionarily conserved characteristics are found 
in most animal cell types but are absent in egg cells and exhibit unexpectedly 
high structural, compositional, and functional diversity in sperm cells. As a 
result, the centriole's precise role in fertility and early embryo development 
is unclear. The centrioles are found in the spermatozoan neck, a strategic 
location connecting two central functional units: the tail, which propels the 
sperm to the egg and the head, which holds the paternal genetic material. The 
spermatozoan neck is an ideal site for evolutionary innovation as it can control 
tail movement pre-fertilization and the male pronucleus' behavior 
post-fertilization. We propose that human, bovine, and most other mammals-which 
exhibit ancestral centriole-dependent reproduction and two spermatozoan 
centrioles, where one canonical centriole is maintained, and one atypical 
centriole is formed-adapted extensive species-specific centriolar features. As a 
result, these centrioles have a high post-fertilization malfunction rate, 
resulting in aneuploidy, and miscarriages. In contrast, house mice evolved 
centriole-independent reproduction, losing the spermatozoan centrioles and 
overcoming a mechanism that causes miscarriages.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the published 
cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) on endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in acute 
stroke patients, with a particular focus on the practice of accounting for costs 
and utilities.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published CEAs on EVT in acute 
stroke patients from 1/1/2009 to 10/1/2019. Published CEAs were searched in Ovid 
Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Cost or comparative effectiveness 
analyses were excluded. Risk of bias and quality assessment was based on the 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard checklist.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in the final analysis, from the USA, 
Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia. They all concluded EVT to be 
cost-effective, but with significant variations in methodology. Fifteen studies 
employed a long-term horizon (> 20 years), while only 11 incorporated risk of 
recurrent strokes. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold varied from 
$10,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to $120,000/QALY, with $50,000/QALY 
and $100,000/QALY being the most commonly used. Five studies undertook a 
societal perspective, but only one accounted for indirect costs. Seventeen 
studies based outcomes on 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, and 9 of 
these 17 studies grouped outcomes by mRS 0-2 and 3-5. Among these 9 studies, the 
range of QALY score reported for mRS 0-2 was 0.71-0.85 QALY, and that of mRS 3-5 
was 0.21-0.40.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals significant heterogeneity in previously published 
thrombectomy CEAs, highlighting need for better standardization in future CEAs.
KEY POINTS: • All included studies concluded thrombectomy to be cost-effective, 
from both long- and short-term perspectives. • Only 5 out of 22 studies 
undertook a societal perspective, and only 1 accounted for indirect costs. • The 
range of value for mRS 0-2 was 0.71-0.85 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and 
0.21-0.40 QALY for mRS 3-5.

Bayesian nonparametric dynamic hazard rates in evolutionary life tables.

Nieto-Barajas LE(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Statistics, ITAM, Mexico City, Mexico. lnieto@itam.mx.

In the study of life tables the random variable of interest is usually assumed 
discrete since mortality rates are studied for integer ages. In dynamic life 
tables a time domain is included to account for the evolution effect of the 
hazard rates in time. In this article we follow a survival analysis approach and 
use a nonparametric description of the hazard rates. We construct a discrete 
time stochastic processes that reflects dependence across age as well as in 
time. This process is used as a bayesian nonparametric prior distribution for 
the hazard rates for the study of evolutionary life tables. Prior properties of 
the process are studied and posterior distributions are derived. We present a 
simulation study, with the inclusion of right censored observations, as well as 
a real data analysis to show the performance of our model.

BACKGROUND: Given the high prevalence of early childhood overweight and obesity, 
more evidence is required to better understand the cost-effectiveness of 
community-wide interventions targeting obesity prevention in children aged 
0-5 years.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the Romp & Chomp community-wide 
early childhood obesity prevention intervention if delivered across Australia in 
2018 from a funder perspective, against a no-intervention comparator.
METHODS: Intervention costs were estimated in 2018 Australian dollars. The 
annual Early Prevention of Obesity in Childhood micro-simulation model estimated 
body mass index (BMI) trajectories to age 15 years, based on end of trial data 
at age 3.5 years. Results from modelled cost-effectiveness analyses were 
presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs): cost per BMI unit 
avoided, and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained at age 15 years.
RESULTS: All Australian children aged 0-5 years (n = 1 906 075) would receive 
the intervention. Total estimated intervention cost and annual cost per 
participant were AUD178 million and AUD93, respectively, if implemented 
nationally. The ICERs were AUD1 126 per BMI unit avoided and AUD26 399 per QALY 
gained (64% probability of being cost-effective measured against a AUD50 000 per 
QALY threshold).
CONCLUSIONS: Romp & Chomp has a fair probability of being cost-effective if 
delivered at scale.

BACKGROUND: Urinary stone disease affects 2-3% of the general population. 
Ureteric stones are associated with severe pain and can have a significant 
impact on a patient's quality of life. Most ureteric stones are expected to pass 
spontaneously with supportive care; however, between one-fifth and one-third of 
patients require an active intervention. The two standard interventions are 
shockwave lithotripsy and ureteroscopic stone treatment. Both treatments are 
effective, but they differ in terms of invasiveness, anaesthetic requirement, 
treatment setting, number of procedures, complications, patient-reported 
outcomes and cost. There is uncertainty around which is the more clinically 
effective and cost-effective treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if shockwave lithotripsy is clinically effective and 
cost-effective compared with ureteroscopic stone treatment in adults with 
ureteric stones who are judged to require active intervention.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentre, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial 
of shockwave lithotripsy as a first-line treatment option compared with primary 
ureteroscopic stone treatment for ureteric stones.
SETTING: Urology departments in 25 NHS hospitals in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥ 16 years presenting with a single ureteric stone in 
any segment of the ureter, confirmed by computerised tomography, who were able 
to undergo either shockwave lithotripsy or ureteroscopic stone treatment and to 
complete trial procedures.
INTERVENTION: Eligible participants were randomised 1 : 1 to shockwave 
lithotripsy (up to two sessions) or ureteroscopic stone treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary clinical outcome measure was resolution of 
the stone episode (stone clearance), which was operationally defined as 'no 
further intervention required to facilitate stone clearance' up to 6 months from 
randomisation. This was determined from 8-week and 6-month case report forms and 
any additional hospital visit case report form that was completed by research 
staff. The primary economic outcome measure was the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained at 6 months from randomisation. We estimated 
costs from NHS resources and calculated quality-adjusted life-years from 
participant completion of the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level version, at 
baseline, pre intervention, 1 week post intervention and 8 weeks and 6 months 
post randomisation.
RESULTS: In the shockwave lithotripsy arm, 67 out of 302 (22.2%) participants 
needed further treatment. In the ureteroscopic stone treatment arm, 31 out of 
302 (10.3%) participants needed further treatment. The absolute risk difference 
was 11.4% (95% confidence interval 5.0% to 17.8%); the upper bound of the 95% 
confidence interval ruled out the prespecified margin of non-inferiority (which 
was 20%). The mean quality-adjusted life-year difference (shockwave lithotripsy 
vs. ureteroscopic stone treatment) was -0.021 (95% confidence interval 0.033 to 
-0.010) and the mean cost difference was -£809 (95% confidence interval -£1061 
to -£551). The probability that shockwave lithotripsy is cost-effective is 79% 
at a threshold of society's willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted life-year 
of £30,000. The CEAC is derived from the joint distribution of incremental costs 
and incremental effects. Most of the results fall in the south-west quadrant of 
the cost effectiveness plane as SWL always costs less but is less effective.
LIMITATIONS: A limitation of the trial was low return and completion rates of 
patient questionnaires. The study was initially powered for 500 patients in each 
arm; however, the total number of patients recruited was only 307 and 306 
patients in the ureteroscopic stone treatment and shockwave lithotripsy arms, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving shockwave lithotripsy needed more further 
interventions than those receiving primary ureteroscopic retrieval, although the 
overall costs for those receiving the shockwave treatment were lower. The 
absolute risk difference between the two clinical pathways (11.4%) was lower 
than expected and at a level that is acceptable to clinicians and patients. The 
shockwave lithotripsy pathway is more cost-effective in an NHS setting, but 
results in lower quality of life.
FUTURE WORK: (1) The generic health-related quality-of-life tools used in this 
study do not fully capture the impact of the various treatment pathways on 
patients. A condition-specific health-related quality-of-life tool should be 
developed. (2) Reporting of ureteric stone trials would benefit from agreement 
on a core outcome set that would ensure that future trials are easier to 
compare.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN92289221.

(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in

Plain Language Summary: Approximately 1 in 20 people suffers from kidney stones 
that pass down the urine drainage tube (ureter) into the urinary bladder and 
cause episodes of severe pain (ureteric colic). People with ureteric colic 
attend hospital for pain relief and diagnosis. Although most stones smaller than 
10 mm eventually reach the bladder and are passed during urination, some get 
stuck and have to be removed using telescopic surgery (called ureteroscopic 
stone treatment) or shockwave therapy (called shockwave lithotripsy). 
Ureteroscopic stone treatment involves passing a telescope-containing instrument 
through the bladder and into the ureter to fragment and/or remove the stone. 
This is usually carried out under general anaesthetic as a day case. For 
shockwave lithotripsy, the patient lies flat on a couch and the apparatus 
underneath them generates shockwaves that pass through the skin to the ureter 
and break the stones into smaller fragments, which can be passed naturally in 
the urine. This involves using X-ray or ultrasound to locate the stone, but can 
be carried out on an outpatient basis and without general anaesthetic. 
Telescopic surgery is known to be more successful at removing stones after just 
one treatment, but it requires more time in hospital and has a higher risk of 
complications than shockwave lithotripsy (however, shockwave lithotripsy may 
require more than one session of treatment). Our study, the Therapeutic 
Interventions for Stones of the Ureter trial, was designed to establish if 
treatment for ureteric colic should start with telescopic surgery or shockwave 
therapy. Over 600 NHS patients took part and they were split into two groups. 
Each patient had an equal chance of their treatment starting with either 
telescopic surgery or shockwave lithotripsy, which was decided by a computer 
program (via random allocation). We counted how many patients in each group had 
further procedures to remove their stone. We found that telescopic surgery was 
11% more effective overall, with an associated slightly better quality of life 
(10 more healthy days over the 6-month period), but was more expensive in an NHS 
setting. The finding of a lack of any significant additional clinical benefit 
leads to the conclusion that the more cost-effective treatment pathway is 
shockwave lithotripsy with telescopic surgery used only in those patients in 
whom shockwave lithotripsy is unsuccessful.

Material efficiency (ME) can support rapid climate change mitigation and 
circular economy. Here, we comprehensively assess the circularity of ME 
strategies for copper use in the U.S. housing services (including residential 
buildings and major household appliances) by integrating use-phase material and 
energy demand. Although the ME strategies of more intensive floor space use and 
extended lifetime of appliances and buildings reduce the primary copper demand, 
employing these strategies increases the commonly neglected use-phase share of 
total copper requirements during the century from 23-28 to 22-42%. Use-phase 
copper requirements for home improvements have remained larger than the demand 
gap (copper demand minus scrap availability) for much of the century, limiting 
copper circularity in the U.S. housing services. Further, use-phase energy 
consumption can negate the benefits of ME strategies. For instance, the lifetime 
extension of lower-efficiency refrigerators increases the copper use and net 
environmental impact by increased electricity use despite reductions from less 
production. This suggests a need for more attention to the use phase when 
assessing circularity, especially for products that are material and energy 
intensive during use. To avoid burden shifting, policymakers should consider the 
entire life cycle of products supporting services when pursuing circular economy 
goals.

BACKGROUND: Population-level health and mortality data are crucial for 
evidence-informed policy but scarce in Nigeria. To fill this gap, we undertook a 
comprehensive assessment of the burden of disease in Nigeria and compared 
outcomes to other west African countries.
METHODS: In this systematic analysis, using data and results of the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019, we analysed patterns 
of mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), 
life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), and health system coverage for 
Nigeria and 15 other west African countries by gender in 1998 and 2019. 
Estimates of all-age and age-standardised disability-adjusted life-years for 369 
diseases and injuries and 87 risk factors are presented for Nigeria. Health 
expenditure per person and gross domestic product were extracted from the World 
Bank repository.
FINDINGS: Between 1998 and 2019, life expectancy and HALE increased in Nigeria 
by 18% to 64·3 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 62·2-66·6), mortality 
reduced for all age groups for both male and female individuals, and health 
expenditure per person increased from the 11th to third highest in west Africa 
by 2018 (US$18·6 in 2001 to $83·75 in 2018). Nonetheless, relative outcomes 
remained poor; Nigeria ranked sixth in west Africa for age-standardised 
mortality, seventh for HALE, tenth for YLLs, 12th for health system coverage, 
and 14th for YLDs in 2019. Malaria (5176·3 YLLs per 100 000 people, 95% UI 
2464·0-9591·1) and neonatal disorders (4818·8 YLLs per 100 000, 3865·9-6064·2) 
were the leading causes of YLLs in Nigeria in 2019. Nigeria had the 
fourth-highest under-five mortality rate for male individuals (2491·8 deaths per 
100 000, 95% UI 1986·1-3140·1) and female individuals (2117·7 deaths per 
100 000, 1756·7-2569·1), but among the lowest mortality for men older than 55 
years. There was evidence of a growing non-communicable disease burden facing 
older Nigerians.
INTERPRETATION: Health outcomes remain poor in Nigeria despite higher 
expenditure since 2001. Better outcomes in countries with equivalent or lower 
health expenditure suggest health system strengthening and targeted intervention 
to address unsafe water sources, poor sanitation, malnutrition, and exposure to 
air pollution could substantially improve population health.

BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of patients with schizophrenia are suffering from motor 
abnormalities, which may contribute to decreased quality of life, impaired work 
capacity, and a reduced life expectancy by 10-20 years. However, the effect of 
motor abnormalities on social and global functioning, as well as, functional 
capacity is not clear. We hypothesized, that the presence of motor abnormalities 
is associated with poorer functional outcomes in patients with schizophrenia.
METHODS: We collected data on 5 different motor abnormalities in 156 patients 
suffering from schizophrenia spectrum disorders: parkinsonism, catatonia, 
dyskinesia, neurological soft signs and psychomotor slowing (PS). Additionally, 
we used three different scales to evaluate the functional outcomes in these 
patients: the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and the Social and 
Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) which use clinicians' 
judgment; and one using a performance-based measure of functional capacity, the 
brief version of the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA-B).
RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrated that patients with catatonia (all F > 4.5; 
p < 0.035) and parkinsonism (all F > 4.9; p < 0.027) scored lower on GAF and 
SOFAS compared to patients without catatonia and parkinsonism. In contrast, no 
significant difference on functional outcomes between patients with dyskinesia 
versus without dyskinesia exist in our study. Furthermore, there are 
statistically significant negative correlations for parkinsonism and PS with 
GAF, SOFAS and UPSA-B (all tau are at least -0.152, p-value <0.036). We also 
found significant negative correlations between catatonia and both GAF & SOFAS 
(all tau are at least -0.203, p-value<0.001) and between NES and SOFAS 
(tau = -0.137, p-value = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: Here, we showed that four of the most common motor abnormalities 
observed in schizophrenia were associated with at least one of the patients' 
functional outcomes. The stronger the motor impairment was the worse the global 
and social functioning. Future studies need to test, whether amelioration of 
motor abnormalities is linked to improved community functioning.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of inward foreign direct 
investment (FDI) on population health. For this purpose, we rely on a new 
measure of health, which not only takes into account life expectancy, but also 
morbidity and allows us to evaluate both quality and length of life. We apply a 
new instrumental variable approach, based on the diffuse characteristic of 
globalization, to a panel of 143 countries over the period 1990-2019 and find an 
overall positive association of FDI with health. However, we also demonstrate 
that this positive relationship decreases with countries' per capita GDP. We 
reveal that developing economies have strongly benefited from inward FDI but, 
more developed economies less so. For the most-developed countries in our 
sample, the impact is even negative, but we demonstrate that higher employment 
protection, which is associated with a lower level of job insecurity, allows 
countries to decrease this pernicious effect.

OBJECTIVE: Brainstem cavernous malformations (BSCMs) are relatively uncommon, 
low-flow vascular lesions in children. Given the paucity of data, guidelines 
regarding the clinical management of BSCMs in children are lacking and the 
surgical indication is most commonly based on an individual surgeon's judgment 
and experience. The goal in this study was to evaluate the clinical behavior of 
BSCMs in childhood and the long-term outcome in children managed conservatively 
and surgically.
METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective study including all children 
with BSCMs who were followed at 2 institutions between 2008 and 2020.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 40 children (27 boys, 67.5%) with a 
mean age of 11.4 years. Twenty-three children (57.5%) were managed 
conservatively, whereas 17 children (42.5%) underwent resection of BSCMs. An 
aggressive clinical course was observed in 13 children (32.5%), who experienced 
multiple hemorrhages with a progressive pattern of neurological decline. 
Multiple BSCMs were observed in 8 patients, of whom 3 patients presented with a 
complex of multiple tightly attached BSCMs and posed a significant therapeutic 
challenge. The overall long-term outcome was favorable (modified Rankin Scale 
[mRS] scores 0-2) in 36 patients (90%), whereas an unfavorable outcome (mRS 
scores 3 and 4) was seen in 4 children (10%). An mRS score of 5 or 6 was not 
observed. The mean (± SD) follow-up was 88.0 (± 92.6) months.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of BSCMs in children is highly variable, with 
benign lesions on the one hand and highly aggressive lesions with repetitive 
hemorrhages on the other. Given the greater life expectancy and the known higher 
functional recovery in children, surgical treatment should be considered early 
in young patients presenting with surgically accessible lesions and an 
aggressive clinical course, and it should be performed in a high-volume center.

Nowadays, the strong increase in products consumption, the purchase of products 
on online platforms as well as the requirements for greater safety and food 
protection are a concern for food and packaging industries. Active packaging 
brings huge advances in the extension of product shelf-life and food degradation 
and losses reduction. This systematic work aims to collect and evaluate all 
existing strategies and technologies of active packaging that can be applied in 
food products, with a global view of new possibilities for food preservation. 
Oxygen scavengers, carbon dioxide emitters/absorbers, ethylene scavengers,

BACKGROUND: Detection of the ROS1 rearrangement is mandatory in patients with 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to allow targeted 
therapy with specific inhibitors. However, in Spanish clinical practice ROS1 
determination is not yet fully widespread. The aim of this study is to determine 
the clinical and economic impact of sequentially testing ROS1 in addition to 
EGFR and ALK in Spain.
METHODS: A joint model (decision-tree and Markov model) was developed to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of testing ROS1 strategy versus a no-ROS1 
testing strategy in Spain. Distribution of ROS1 techniques, rates of testing, 
positivity, and invalidity of biomarkers included in the analysis (EGFR, ALK, 
ROS1 and PD-L1) were based on expert opinion and Lungpath real-world database. 
Treatment allocation depending on the molecular testing results was defined by 
expert opinion. For each treatment, a 3-states Markov model was developed, where 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) curves were 
parameterized using exponential extrapolations to model transition of patients 
among health states. Only medical direct costs were included (€ 2021). A 
lifetime horizon was considered and a discount rate of 3% was applied for both 
costs and effects. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were performed to address uncertainty.
RESULTS: A target population of 8755 patients with advanced NSCLC (non-squamous 
or never smokers squamous) entered the model. Over a lifetime horizon, the ROS1 
testing scenario produced additional 157.5 life years and 121.3 quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) compared with no-ROS1 testing scenario. Total direct costs 
were increased up to € 2,244,737 for ROS1 testing scenario. The incremental 
cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was 18,514 €/QALY. Robustness of the base-case results 
were confirmed by the sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that ROS1 testing in addition to EGFR and ALK is a 
cost-effective strategy compared to no-ROS1 testing, and it generates more than 
120 QALYs in Spain over a lifetime horizon. Despite the low prevalence of ROS1 
rearrangements in NSCLC patients, the clinical and economic consequences of ROS1 
testing should encourage centers to test all advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
(non-squamous and never-smoker squamous) patients.

BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency (ID) impairs patient physical activity, recognition 
and life quality, which is difficult to perceive but should not be 
underestimated. Worldwide efforts have been made to lower ID burden, however, 
whether it decreased equally in different regions and sexes is unclear. This 
study is to examine regional and sex inequalities in global ID from 1990 to 
2017.
METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal, comparative burden-of-disease study. 
Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of ID were obtained from Global Burden of 
Disease Report 2017. Human Development Index (HDI) data were obtained from Human 
Development Report 2017. Gini coefficient and the concentration index were 
calculated to assess the equities in global burden of ID.
RESULTS: A downward trend of global ID burden (from 569.3 (95% Uncertainty 
Interval [UI]: 387.8-815.6) to 403.0 (95% UI: 272.4-586.6), p < 0.001), 
age-adjusted DALYs per 100,000 population) but an uptrend of its inequalities 
(from 0.366 to 0.431, p < 0.001, Gini coefficients) was observed between 1990 
and 2017. ID burden was heavier in women than that in men ([age-adjusted DALYs 
per 100,000 population from 742.2 to 514.3] vs [from 398.5 to 291.9]), but its 
inequalities were higher in men since 1990. The between-sex gap of ID burden was 
narrowed with higher HDI (β =  - 364.11, p < 0.001). East Asia & Pacific and 
South Asia regions made a big stride for ID control in both sexes over decades 
[age-adjusted DALYs per 100,000 population from 378.7 (95% UI: 255.8-551.7) in 
1990 to 138.9 (95%UI: 91.8-206.5) in 2017], while a heavy burden among 
Sub-Saharan African men was persistent[age-adjusted DALYs per 
100,000 population, 572.5 (95% UI: 385.3-815) in 1990 and 562.6 (95% UI: 
367.9-833.3) in 2017].
CONCLUSIONS: Redistributing attention and resources to help countries with low 
HDI, especially take care of women with low socioeconomic status (SES) and men 
under high ID burden may help hold back the expanding ID inequality.
