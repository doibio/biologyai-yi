Cushing's syndrome (CS) in the pediatric population is challenging to diagnose 
and treat. Although next-generation medical therapies are emerging for adults 
with CS, none are currently approved or used in children. Here we describe the 
first use of mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, to treat CS in 
a pediatric subject. The patient, a 14-year-old girl with an 18-month history of 
metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, suffered from fatigue, profound myopathy, 
irritability, and depression. She was found to have hypertension, hypokalemia, 
and worsening control of her preexisting type 1 diabetes. In this report, we 
detail our clinical evaluation that confirmed CS caused by an ectopic 
adrenocorticotropic hormone secreting tumor. Surgical and radiation therapies 
were not pursued because of her poor functional status and limited life 
expectancy, and medical treatment of CS was indicated for symptom relief. 
Mifepristone treatment provided rapid improvement in glycemic control, insulin 
resistance, and hypertension as well as significant diminishment of her myopathy 
and fatigue. Hypokalemia was managed with an oral potassium replacement and dose 
escalation of spironolactone; no other significant adverse effects were 
observed. Despite successful palliation of Cushing's signs and symptoms, the 
patient died of progression of her cancer. This case demonstrates the safety and 
efficacy of mifepristone treatment in a pediatric patient with symptomatic, 
ectopic CS. We conclude that, in appropriate pediatric patients with CS, 
glucocorticoid receptor antagonism with mifepristone should be considered to 
control the effects of hypercortisolism and to improve quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Years of potential life lost (YPLL) complement incidence and 
survival rates by measuring how much a patient's life is likely to be shortened 
by his or her cancer. In this study, we examine the impact of death due to brain 
and other central nervous system (CNS) tumors compared to other common cancers 
in adults by investigating the YPLL of adults in the United States.
METHODS: Mortality and life table data were obtained from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics Vital 
Statistics Data for 2010. The study population included individuals aged 20 
years or older at death who died from one of the selected cancers. YPLL was 
calculated by taking an individual's age at death and finding the corresponding 
expected remaining years of life using life table data.
RESULTS: The cancers with the greatest mean YPLL were other malignant CNS tumors 
(20.65), malignant brain tumors (19.93), and pancreatic cancer (15.13) for males 
and malignant brain tumors (20.31), breast cancer (18.78), and other malignant 
CNS tumors (18.36) for females. For both sexes, non-Hispanic whites had the 
lowest YPLL, followed by non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics.
CONCLUSION: Malignant brain and other CNS tumors have the greatest mean YPLL, 
thereby reflecting their short survival time post diagnosis. These findings will 
hopefully motivate more research into mitigating the impact of these 
debilitating tumors.

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Cycling masticatory loads decrease the strength of 
particulate filler composites (PFCs) and initiate the failure process by 
fatigue. The life expectancy of a composite resin restoration under stress 
remains difficult to predict.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the fracture resistance and 
the compressive fatigue limits (CFL) of anterior crown restorations made of a 
short-fiber reinforced composite resin (SFC), to investigate selected mechanical 
properties of the material following standard test methods, and to observe their 
correlation with the CFL.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens (n=10) were fabricated either from SFC (everX 
Posterior, GC Corp) or PFC (G-ænial anterior, GC Corp). The properties 
investigated were flexural strength (FS), compression strength (CS), 
diametral-tensile strength (DTS), and single-edge-notched-bend fracture 
toughness (FT) following ISO standards. Fracture resistance was determined by 
static load (n=10) and the CFL at 10000 cycles was determined using a staircase 
approach (n=20), both on anterior composite resin crowns. The results were 
analyzed with 1-way ANOVA (α=.05) or 2-way ANOVA (α=.05) followed by a Tukey B 
post hoc test and the Pearson-correlation analysis.
RESULTS: The SFC crowns had higher fracture resistance (954 ±121 N) than the PFC 
crowns (415 ±75 N) (P<.001) and higher CFL (267 ±23 N) than the PFC crowns (135 
±64 N) (P<.001). SFC revealed also higher FT (2.6 ±0.6 MPa·m(1/2)) than the PFC 
(1.0 ±0.2 MPa·m(1/2)) (F=69.313, P<.001). A significant correlation was observed 
only between the FT and the CFL (r(2)=0.899; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: SFC crowns showed good performance under static and fatigue 
loading. FT was the only in vitro test method that filtered as a clinically 
relevant parameter.

INTRODUCTION: Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects 40-50% of patients 
with diabetic neuropathy, leading to impaired quality of life and substantial 
costs. Duloxetine and pregabalin have evidence-based support, and are formally 
approved for controlling painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
METHODS: We used a 12-week decision model for examining painful diabetic 
peripheral neuropathy first-line therapy with daily doses of duloxetine 60mg or 
pregabalin 300mg, under the perspective of the Instituto Venezolano de los 
Seguros Sociales. We gathered model parameters from published literature and 
expert´s opinion, focusing on the magnitude of pain relief, the presence of 
adverse events, the possibility of withdrawal owing to intolerable adverse 
events or due to lack of efficacy, and the quality-adjusted life years expected 
in each strategy. We analyzed direct medical costs (which are expressed in 
Bolívares Fuertes, BsF) comprising drug acquisition besides additional care 
devoted to treatment of adverse events and poor pain relief. We conducted both 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Total expected costs per 1000 patients were BsF 1 046 146 (26%) lower 
with duloxetine than with pregabalin. Most of these savings (91%) corresponds to 
the difference in the acquisitions cost of each medication. duloxetine also 
provided 23 more patients achieving good pain relief and a gain of about two 
quality-adjusted life years per 1000 treated. Model was robust to plausible 
changes in main parameters. Duloxetine remained the preferred option in 93.9% of 
the second-order Monte Carlo simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests duloxetine dominates (i.e., is more effective 
and lead to gains in quality-adjusted life years), remaining less costly than 
pregabalin for treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: La neuropatía diabética periférica dolorosa (NDPD) 
afecta a 40-50% de los pacientes con neuropatía diabética y se asocia con un 
deterioro significativo de la calidad de vida y con costos de magnitud 
considerable. Tanto duloxetina (DUL) como pregabalina (PGB) cuentan con sustento 
científico basado en evidencias y han sido formalmente aprobados para controlar 
la NDPD.
MÉTODOS: Se utilizó un modelo de decisión a 12 semanas para examinar el 
tratamiento de primera línea para la neuropatía diabética periférica dolorosa, 
con dosis diarias de duloxetina 60 mg o con pregabalina 300 mg, bajo la 
perspectiva del Instituto Venezolano de los Seguros Sociales. Los parámetros del 
modelo proceden de literatura publicada y opinión de expertos, enfocándose en la 
magnitud del alivio del dolor, la presencia de eventos adversos, la posibilidad 
de abandono debido a eventos adversos intolerables o por falta de eficacia y en 
los años de vida ajustados por calidad esperados con cada estrategia. Se 
analizaron los costos médicos directos (expresados en bolívares fuertes), 
integrados por la adquisición de medicamentos, además del cuidado adicional que 
se origina por el tratamiento de los eventos adversos y como consecuencia de un 
pobre alivio del dolor. Se llevaron a cabo análisis de sensibilidad de tipo 
determinístico y probabilístico.
RESULTADOS: Los costos totales esperados por cada 1000 pacientes fueron de 1 046 
146 bolívares fuertes (26%) más bajos con duloxetina en comparación con la 
pregabalina. La mayor parte de estos ahorros (91%), corresponde a la diferencia 
en el costo de adquisición entre ambos medicamentos. La duloxetina también se 
asoció con ganancias de 23 pacientes que lograron un buen alivio del dolor y de 
dos años de vida ajustados por calidad por cada 1000 tratados. El modelo se 
mantuvo robusto ante cambios plausibles en sus parámetros principales. La 
duloxetina continuó siendo la opción preferida en 93,9% de las simulaciones de 
Monte Carlo de segundo orden generadas.
CONCLUSIONES: El presente estudio sugiere que la duloxetina domina a (es más 
efectiva, conduce a ganancias en años de vida ajustados por calidad y es menos 
costosa que) la pregabalina, para el tratamiento de la neuropatía diabética 
periférica dolorosa.

United States Life Tables, 2011.

Arias E.

OBJECTIVES: This report presents complete period life tables for the United 
States by race, Hispanic origin, and sex, based on age specific death rates in 
2011.
METHODS: Data used to prepare the 2011 life tables are 2011 final mortality 
statistics; July 1, 2011, population estimates based on the 2010 decennial 
census; and 2011 Medicare data for persons aged 66-99. The methodology used to 
estimate the 2011 life tables was first implemented with data year 2008. The 
methodology used to estimated the life tables for the Hispanic population 
remains unchanged from that developed for the publication of life tables by 
Hispanic origin for data year 2006.
RESULTS: In 2011, the overall expectation of life at birth was 78.7 
years--unchanged from 2010. Between 2010 and 2011, life expectancy at birth 
increased for both males (from 76.2 to 76.3) and females (81.0-81.1), and for 
the white population (78.9 to 79.0), the black population (75.1 to 75.3), the 
Hispanic population *81.4 to 81.6), and the non-Hispanic black population (74.7 
to 74.9).

Diethyl maleate (DEM) is a thiol-depleting agent frequently employed in cell 
culture analyses. Here, we investigated the effect of DEM exposure on insulin 
signaling at the level of FoxO transcription factor activity and its potential 
consequences for stress resistance and life span. Exposure of HepG2 human 
hepatoma cells to subcytotoxic concentrations of DEM resulted in nuclear 
accumulation of overexpressed EGFP-tagged FoxO1a. DEM-induced nuclear 
accumulation overrode insulin-induced nuclear exclusion of FoxO1a. Despite a 
slightly enhanced FoxO DNA binding activity in DEM-exposed cells, expression of 
FoxO-regulated genes (glucose 6-phosphatase, selenoprotein P) was downregulated, 
indicating that nuclear accumulation does not necessarily coincide with enhanced 
transcription factor activity. To test for an effect of DEM on organismal stress 
resistance, we exposed C. elegans roundworms to the thiol depletor. Survival in 
the presence of the redox cycler paraquat was significantly increased following 
exposure to DEM, implying that DEM pre-exposure induced cellular resistance 
against oxidative stress. Furthermore, in DEM-exposed C. elegans populations 
expressing a GFP-tagged version of the C. elegans FoxO ortholog, DAF-16, numbers 
of worms with predominantly nuclear DAF-16 increased - in line with the findings 
from HepG2 cells. In keeping with the known function of DAF-16 in stress 
resistance, C. elegans life span was elevated upon exposure to DEM in a 
concentration-dependent manner. A maximum extension of life span and 
deceleration of aging was achieved at 100 µ? of DEM. In summary, exposure to DEM 
caused a modulation of FoxO subcellular localization in both HepG2 cells and C. 
elegans roundworms, followed by a modulation of life span and stress resistance 
in C. elegans.

Patients with schizophrenia have a higher mortality than the general population. 
The risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease is twice as 
high as in people without psychotic disorders. There are differences in 
emergency care as well as in secondary prevention in cardiovascular disorders 
and diabetes. The reason for the increased morbidity and mortality is most 
likely both inadequate diagnostic procedures and inadequate treatment 
interventions. Pharmacologic antipsychotic treatment can have negative metabolic 
side effects. Guidelines for identifying metabolic effects are described. 
Psychiatrists are advised to collaborate with specialists in internal medicine, 
paediatrics or general practice.

Schizophrenia is a disorder that causes the individual a very high risk of 
premature death, a high occurrence of positive and negative symptoms and 
disorganized thoughts and behavior rendering a normal life in society difficult. 
The substantial and enduring cognitive symptom are not alleviated by medication 
and causes difficulties in everyday life activities. The social dysfunction is 
further aggravated by the isolation and lack of work that patients with 
schizophrenia most often endure. The long-term prognosis is very poor according 
to more recent research and should be given appropriate attention in 
health-care, communities and political priorities.

AIM: Cardiac inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of heart failure. 
However, the consequence of systemic inflammation on concomitant established 
heart failure, and in particular diastolic heart failure, is less explored. Here 
we investigated the impact of systemic inflammation, caused by sustained 
Toll-like receptor 9 activation, on established diastolic heart failure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Diastolic heart failure was established in 8-10 week old 
cardiomyocyte specific, inducible SERCA2a knock out (i.e., SERCA2a KO) C57Bl/6J 
mice. Four weeks after conditional KO, mice were randomized to receive Toll-like 
receptor 9 agonist (CpG B; 2μg/g body weight) or PBS every third day. After 
additional four weeks, echocardiography, phase contrast magnetic resonance 
imaging, histology, flow cytometry, and cardiac RNA analyses were performed. A 
subgroup was followed, registering morbidity and death. Non-heart failure 
control groups treated with CpG B or PBS served as controls. Our main findings 
were: (i) Toll-like receptor 9 activation (CpG B) reduced life expectancy in 
SERCA2a KO mice compared to PBS treated SERCA2a KO mice. (ii) Diastolic function 
was lower in SERCA2a KO mice with Toll-like receptor 9 activation. (iii) 
Toll-like receptor 9 stimulated SERCA2a KO mice also had increased cardiac and 
systemic inflammation.
CONCLUSION: Sustained activation of Toll-like receptor 9 causes cardiac and 
systemic inflammation, and deterioration of SERCA2a depletion-mediated diastolic 
heart failure.

The honeybee Apis mellifera, with a brain of only 960,000 neurons and the 
ability to perform sophisticated cognitive tasks, has become an excellent model 
in life sciences and in particular in cognitive neurosciences. It has been used 
in our laboratories to investigate brain and behavioural asymmetries, i.e., the 
different functional specializations of the right and the left sides of the 
brain. It is well known that bees can learn to associate an odour stimulus with 
a sugar reward, as demonstrated by extension of the proboscis when presented 
with the trained odour in the so-called Proboscis Extension Reflex (PER) 
paradigm. Bees recall this association better when trained using their right 
antenna than they do when using their left antenna. They also retrieve 
short-term memory of this task better when using the right antenna. On the other 
hand, when tested for long-term memory recall, bees respond better when using 
their left antenna. Here we review a series of behavioural studies investigating 
bees' lateralization, integrated with electrophysiological measurements to study 
asymmetries of olfactory sensitivity, and discuss the possible evolutionary 
origins of these asymmetries. We also present morphological data obtained by 
scanning electron microscopy and two-photon microscopy. Finally, a behavioural 
study conducted in a social context is summarised, showing that honeybees 
control context-appropriate social interactions using their right antenna, 
rather than the left, thus suggesting that lateral biases in behaviour might be

The concept of 'successful aging' has long intrigued the scientific community. 
Despite this long-standing interest, a consensus definition has proven to be a 
difficult task, due to the inherent challenge involved in defining such a 
complex, multi-dimensional phenomenon. The lack of a clear set of defining 
characteristics for the construct of successful aging has made comparison of 
findings across studies difficult and has limited advances in aging research. A 
consensus on markers of successful aging is furthest developed is the domain of 
physical functioning. For example, walking speed appears to be an excellent 
surrogate marker of overall health and predicts the maintenance of physical 
independence, a cornerstone of successful aging. The purpose of the present 
article is to provide an overview and discussion of specific health conditions, 
behavioral factors, and biological mechanisms that mark declining mobility and 
physical function and promising interventions to counter these effects. With 
life expectancy continuing to increase in the United States and developed 
countries throughout the world, there is an increasing public health focus on 
the maintenance of physical independence among all older adults.

BACKGROUND: Uncertainty exists regarding the best management of patients with 
degenerative tears of the rotator cuff.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
arthroscopic and open rotator cuff repair in patients aged ≥ 50 years with 
degenerative rotator cuff tendon tears.
DESIGN: Two parallel-group randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Nineteen teaching and district general hospitals in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients (n = 273) aged ≥ 50 years with degenerative rotator cuff 
tendon tears.
INTERVENTIONS: Arthroscopic surgery and open rotator cuff repair, with surgeons 
using their usual and preferred method of arthroscopic or open repair. Follow-up 
was by telephone questionnaire at 2 and 8 weeks after surgery and by postal 
questionnaire at 8, 12 and 24 months after randomisation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) at 24 months was the 
primary outcome measure. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the shoulder 
was made at 12 months after surgery to assess the integrity of the repair.
RESULTS: The mean OSS improved from 26.3 [standard deviation (SD) 8.2] at 
baseline to 41.7 (SD 7.9) at 24 months for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 
(SD 8.0) at baseline to 41.5 (SD 7.9) at 24 months for open surgery. When effect 
sizes are shown for the intervention, a negative sign indicates that an open 
procedure is favoured. For the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no 
statistical difference between the groups, the difference in OSS score at 24 
months was -0.76 [95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75 to 1.22; p = 0.452] and the 
CI excluded the predetermined clinically important difference in the OSS of 3 
points. There was also no statistical difference when the groups were compared 
per protocol (difference in OSS score -0.46, 95% CI -5.30 to 4.39; p = 0.854). 
The questionnaire response rate was > 86%. At 8 months, 77% of participants 
reported that shoulder problems were much or slightly better, and at 24 months 
this increased to 85%. There were no significant differences in mean cost 
between the arthroscopic group and the open repair group for any of the 
component resource-use categories, nor for the total follow-up costs at 24 
months. The overall treatment cost at 2 years was £2567 (SD £176) for 
arthroscopic surgery and £2699 (SD £149) for open surgery, according to 
intention-to-treat analysis. For the per-protocol analysis there was a 
significant difference in total initial procedure-related costs between the 
arthroscopic group and the open repair group, with arthroscopic repair being 
more costly by £371 (95% CI £135 to £607). Total quality-adjusted life-years 
accrued at 24 months averaged 1.34 (SD 0.05) in the arthroscopic repair group 
and 1.35 (SD 0.05) in the open repair group, a non-significant difference of 
0.01 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.10). The rate of re-tear was not significantly different 
across the randomised groups (46.4% and 38.6% for arthroscopic and open surgery, 
respectively). The participants with tears that were impossible to repair had 
the lowest OSSs, the participants with re-tears had slightly higher OSSs and the 
participants with healed repairs had the most improved OSSs. These findings were 
the same when analysed per protocol.
CONCLUSION: In patients aged > 50 years with a degenerative rotator cuff tear 
there is no difference in clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness between 
open repair and arthroscopic repair at 2 years for the primary outcome (OSS) and 
all other prespecified secondary outcomes. Future work should explore new 
methods to improve tendon healing and reduce the high rate of re-tears observed 
in this trial.

BACKGROUND: In dairy cattle, current genomic predictions are largely based on 
sire models that analyze daughter yield deviations of bulls, which are derived 
from pedigree-based animal model evaluations (in a two-step approach). Extension 
to animal model genomic predictions (AMGP) is not straightforward, because most 
of the animals that are involved in the genetic evaluation are not genotyped. In 
single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (SSGBLUP), the 
pedigree-based relationship matrix A and the genomic relationship matrix G are 
combined in a matrix H, which allows for AMGP. However, as the number of 
genotyped animals increases, imputation of the genotypes for all animals in the 
pedigree may be considered. Our aim was to impute genotypes for all animals in 
the pedigree, construct alternative relationship matrices based on the 
imputation results, and evaluate the accuracy of the resulting AMGP by 
cross-validation in the national Norwegian Red dairy cattle population.
RESULTS: A large-scale national dataset was effectively handled by splitting it 
into two sets: (1) genotyped animals and their ancestors (i.e. GA set with 
20,918 animals) and (2) the descendants of the genotyped animals (i.e. D set 
with 4,022,179 animals). This allowed restricting genomic computations to a 
relatively small set of animals (GA set), whereas the majority of the animals (D 
set) were added to the animal model equations using Henderson's rules, in order 
to make optimal use of the D set information. Genotypes were imputed by 
segregation analysis of a large pedigree with relatively few genotyped animals 
(3285 out of 20,918). Among the AMGP models, the linkage and linkage 
disequilibrium based G matrix (G LDLA0 ) yielded the highest accuracy, which on 
average was 0.06 higher than with SSGBLUP and 0.07 higher than with two-step 
sire genomic evaluations.
CONCLUSIONS: AMGP methods based on genotype imputation on a national scale were 
developed, and the most accurate method, GLDLA0BLUP, combined linkage and 
linkage disequilibrium information. The advantage of AMGP over a sire model 
based on two-step genomic predictions is expected to increase as the number of 
genotyped cows increases and for species, with smaller sire families and more 
dam relationships.

Knowledge of bed bug development under varying conditions can lead to more 
sophisticated management techniques. Development rate, age and stage-specific 
life tables were compared for a laboratory strain (HS) and field strain (ECL-05) 
of bed bug Cimex lectularius L. (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) reared on two blood 
regimens: human or rabbit blood. Harlan and ECL-05 bed bugs reared on human 
blood had a life expectancy of 207 and 208 days respectively from the egg stage. 
Egg to adult development of HS bed bugs reared on human blood (~35 days) was 
significantly longer than that of the ECL-05 strain (~33 days) in the third, 
fourth, and fifth instars. The HS and ECL-05 bed bugs reared on rabbit blood had 
a life expectancy of 149 and 174 days respectively. Egg to adult development 
time of HS on rabbit blood (~52 days) was significantly longer than ECL-05 (~37 
days) in every instar, and HS total life span was significantly shorter compared 
to ECL-05. Developmental differences based on strain and blood regimen suggest 
rabbit blood is an inferior blood source for colony maintenance, and strain has 
variable effects on bed bug development. Findings suggest that blood regimen 
should strongly be considered in bed bug colony maintenance.

Obesity is a medical disease that is increasing significantly nowadays. 
Worldwide obesity prevalence doubled since 1980. Obese patients are at great 
risk for complications with physical and psychological burdens, thus affecting 
their quality of life. Obesity is well known to have higher risk for 
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, musculoskeletal diseases and shorter 
life expectancy. In addition, obesity has a great impact on surgical diseases, 
and elective surgeries in comparison to general population. There is higher risk 
for wound infection, longer operative time, poorer outcome, and others. The 
higher the BMI (body mass index), the higher the risk for these complications. 
This literature review illustrates the prevalence of obesity as a diseases and 
complications of obesity in general as well as, in a surgical point of view, 
general surgery perioperative risks and complications among obese patients. It 
will review the evidence-based updates in these headlines.

Greatly enhanced accountability can drive mental health reform. As extant 
approaches are ineffective, we propose a new approach. Australia spends around 
$7.6 billion on mental health services annually, but is anybody getting better? 
Effective accountability for mental health can reduce variation in care and 
increase effective service provision. Despite 20 years of rhetoric, Australia's 
approach to accountability in mental health is overly focused on fulfilling 
governmental reporting requirements rather than using data to drive reform. The 
existing system is both fragmented and outcome blind. Australia has failed to 
develop useful local and regional approaches to benchmarking in mental health. 
New approaches must address this gap and better reflect the experience of care 
felt by consumers and carers, as well as by service providers. There are 
important social priorities in mental health that must be assessed. We provide a 
brief overview of the existing system and propose a new, modest but achievable 
set of indicators by which to monitor the progress of national mental health 
reform. These indicators should form part of a new, system-wide process of 
continuous quality improvement in mental health care and suicide prevention.

AIM: Early results from sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) for severe irritable 
bowel syndrome (IBS) are promising but estimates of cost-effectiveness are 
lacking. Our object was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis for SNS as an 
alternative to no treatment of IBS.
METHOD: This retrospective analysis was based on the results from a randomized 
controlled crossover study with a cost-utility analysis performed on 
patient-level data and modelling of censored data over a projected period of 
time of up to 20 years. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat 
approach. For estimation of the uncertainty of the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio a bias corrected bootstrap analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness was not reached for 4 years after permanent 
implantation (£31 270 per quality-adjusted life years), which was the upper 
limit for patient follow-up, but our data imply a cost-effectiveness from a 
7-year perspective onwards.
CONCLUSION: The study indicates the SNS treatment for IBS is cost effective from 
a 7-year perspective onwards.

Life expectancy is increasing in most countries. With increasing age, many 
individuals may develop involutional ophthalmic diseases, such as eyelid aging. 
Dermatochalasis, ptosis, ectropion, and entropion are common disorders in 
middle-aged and older adults. This review outlines the pathophysiology and 
clinical management of these involutional eyelid disorders. Recently, a decrease 
in elastic fibers with ultrastructural abnormalities and an overexpression of 
elastin-degrading enzymes have been demonstrated in involutional ectropion and 
entropion. This may be the consequence of local ischemia, inflammation, and/or 
chronic mechanical stress. Eyelid aging with progressive loss of tone and laxity 
may affect the ocular surface and adnexal tissues, resulting in different 
clinical symptoms and signs. Surgical management depends on the appropriate 
correction of the underlying anatomical defect.

BACKGROUND: High rates of HIV infection have decreased life expectancy in many 
African countries. Regardless of worldwide efforts to escalate treatment, care 
and prevention strategies, the number of deaths due to AIDS-related disorders is 
still high. Local healthcare workers suspect that there are modifiable factors 
in the care of HIV and/or AIDS patients which can be identified and improved.
AIM: To describe the HIV and/or AIDS-related causes of adult mortality and 
identify modifiable factors amongst patients admitted to Oshakati Intermediate 
Hospital, northern Namibia.
