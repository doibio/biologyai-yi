osteopenia group. Multivariate analyses showed that preoperative osteopenia was 
significantly associated with worse overall survival (HR: 4.135; 95% CI, 
2.963-5.770; p < 0.001), disease-specific survival (HR: 7.673; 95% CI, 
4.646-12.675; p < 0.001), and recurrence-free survival (HR: 5.039; 95% CI, 
3.811-6.662; p < 0.001). The prognosis of the osteopenia group was poorer than 
that of the no osteopenia group in every stage: 5-year overall survival (stage 
I: 89.4% vs 96.9%, p = 0.028; stage II: 76.5% vs 91.9%, p < 0.001; stage III: 
56.4% vs 90.8%, p < 0.001) and 5-year recurrence-free survival (stage I: 85.4% 
vs 96.6%, p = 0.002; stage II: 62.0% vs 86.5%, p < 0.001; stage III: 26.4% vs 
80.0%, p < 0.001).
LIMITATIONS: The main limitations are retrospective single-institutional 
features and races of the study population.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative osteopenia could be a strong predictive marker for 
long-term prognosis in colorectal cancer regardless of stage.
EL IMPACTO PRONSTICO DE LA OSTEOPENIA PREOPERATORIA EN PACIENTES CON CNCER 
COLORRECTAL: ANTECEDENTES:La osteopenia, una afección en la que la densidad 
mineral ósea es más baja de lo normal, es un relevante factor de riesgo que 
conduce a una expectativa menor de vida saludable.OBJETIVO:Investigar el impacto 
pronóstico de la osteopenia preoperatoria en pacientes con cáncer colorrectal 
(CCR).DISEÑO:Un estudio retrospectivo.AJUSTE:Estudio realizado en un hospital 
universitario.PACIENTES:Un total de 1.086 pacientes con CCR en estadio I-III 
sometidos a una resección curativa.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:La 
osteopenia se evaluó con imágenes de tomografía computarizada. La supervivencia 
global la supervivencia específica de la enfermedad y la supervivencia libre de 
recurrencia fueron los criterios de valoración primaria.RESULTADOS:Se identificó 
osteopenia en 300 pacientes (27,6%). En comparación con el grupo sin osteopenia, 
las tasas de supervivencia global a 5 años (74,0% frente a 93,4%, p < 0,001), 
supervivencia especifica de la enfermedad (81,6 % frente a 97,2%, p < 0,001) 
tasas de supervivencia libre de recurrencia (57,1% frente a 88,3%, p < 0,001) 
fueron significativamente más bajas en el grupo de osteopenia. Los análisis 
multivariados mostraron que la osteopenia preoperatoria se asoció 
significativamente con una peor supervivencia global (HR 4,135; IC 95% 
2,963-5,770; p < 0,001), supervivencia especifica de la enfermedad (HR 7,673; IC 
95% 4,646-12,675; p < 0,001) y tasas de supervivencia libre de recurrencia (HR 
5,039; IC 95% 3,811-6,662; p < 0,001). El pronóstico del grupo con osteopenia 
fue peor que el del grupo sin osteopenia en todos los estadios: supervivencia 
global a 5 años (estadio I: 89,4% frente a 96,9%, p = 0,028; estadio II: 76,5% 
frente a 91,9%, p < 0,001; estadio III: 56,4% frente a 90,8%, p < 0,001) y tasas 
de supervivencia libre de recurrencia a 5 años (estadio I: 85,4% frente a 96,6%, 
p < 0,002; estadio II: 62,0% frente a 86,5%, p < 0,001; estadio III: 26,4% 
frente a 80,0%, p < 0,001).LIMITACIONES:Las principales limitaciones son las 
características retrospectivas de una sola institución y las razas de la 
población de estudio.CONCLUSIONES:La osteopenia preoperatoria puede ser un 
fuerte marcador predictivo para el pronóstico a largo plazo en CCR 
independientemente de la etapa. (Traducción-Dr. Fidel Ruiz Healy ).

Aging is associated with progressive phenotypic changes. Virtually all cellular 
phenotypes are produced by proteins, and their structural alterations can lead 
to age-related diseases. However, we still lack comprehensive knowledge of 
proteins undergoing structural-functional changes during cellular aging and 
their contributions to age-related phenotypes. Here, we conducted proteome-wide 
analysis of early age-related protein structural changes in budding yeast using 
limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry (LiP-MS). The results, compiled in online 
ProtAge catalog, unraveled age-related functional changes in regulators of 
translation, protein folding, and amino acid metabolism. Mechanistically, we 
found that folded glutamate synthase Glt1 polymerizes into supramolecular 
self-assemblies during aging, causing breakdown of cellular amino acid 
homeostasis. Inhibiting Glt1 polymerization by mutating the polymerization 
interface restored amino acid levels in aged cells, attenuated mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and led to lifespan extension. Altogether, this comprehensive map 
of protein structural changes enables identifying mechanisms of age-related 
phenotypes and offers opportunities for their reversal.

Cystic fibrosis is a multiorgan disease caused by impaired function of the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Since the 
introduction of the CFTR modulator combination elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor 
(ETI), which acts directly on mutant CFTR to enhance its activity, most people 
with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) have seen pronounced reductions in symptoms, and 
studies project marked increases in life expectancy for pwCF who are eligible 
for ETI. However, modulator therapy has not cured cystic fibrosis and the 
success of CFTR modulators has resulted in immediate questions about the new 
state of cystic fibrosis disease and clinical challenges in the care of pwCF. In 
this Series paper, we summarise key questions about cystic fibrosis disease in 
the era of modulator therapy, highlighting state-of-the-art research and 
clinical practices, knowledge gaps, new challenges faced by pwCF and the 
potential for future health-care challenges, and the pressing need for 
additional therapies to treat the underlying genetic or molecular causes of 
cystic fibrosis.

Ferroptosis is characterized by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. 
However, a clinical dose of Fe3O4 nanoparticles could not cause effective 
ferroptosis in tumors, and the mechanism is yet to be completely understood. In 
this study, using RNA-seq data, we found that tumor cells could 
feedback-activate the antioxidant system by upregulating Nrf-2 expression, thus 
avoiding ferroptosis caused by Fe3O4 nanoparticles. We also found that DHJS (a 
probe for ROS generation) can antagonize Nrf-2 expression when it synergizes 
with Fe3O4 nanoparticles, thus inducing ferroptosis in tumor cells. Considering 
these findings, we created a biomimetic hybrid cell membrane camouflaged by 
PLGA-loaded Fe3O4 and DHJS to treat osteosarcoma. The hybrid cell membrane 
endowed the core nanoparticle with the extension of blood circulation life and 
enhanced homologous targeting ability. In addition, DHJS and Fe3O4 in 
nanoparticles prompted synergistically lethal ferroptosis in cancer cells and 
induced macrophage M1 polarization as well as the infiltration of CD8(+) T cells 
and dendritic cells in tumors. In summary, this study provides novel mechanistic 
insights and practical strategies for ferroptosis induction of Fe3O4 
nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the synthesized biomimetic nanoparticles exhibited 
synergistic ferroptosis/immunotherapy against osteosarcoma.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with de novo distant 
metastasis (M1) is classified as stage IVB in the 8th edition of the staging 
system jointly adopted by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the 
International Union against Cancer Control. Patients with M1 disease generally 
have a relatively short life expectancy. This review discusses the personalized 
and intensified treatment strategies for de novo metastatic NPC.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed to identify peer-reviewed 
publications on subdivisions of M1 disease and treatment of de novo metastatic 
NPC. Clinicaltrials.gov and Chinese Clinical Trial Register were searched to 
identify ongoing clinical trials evaluating systemic or local therapy of 
previously untreated metastatic NPC.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: M1 encompasses a diverse group of diseases. Several 
important factors, including tumor burden, EBV-DNA levels, location of 
involvement, the number of metastasis, and treatment strategies, influence the 
prognosis of NPC patients. Researchers have attempted to define M1 
subcategorization to reflect the underlying risk profile and tailor personalized 
treatment. Recent advancements have brought new hope for this otherwise 
incurable condition. In the era of immunotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors have 
become the first-line systemic treatment for metastatic NPC in JUPITER-02, 
CAPTAIN-1st, and RATIONALE-309. Additionally, the value of radical locoregional 
radiation therapy and ablative treatment to distant metastatic sites should not 
be overlooked in patients with de novo metastatic diseases. Locoregional 
radiation with concurrent chemotherapy, maintenance chemotherapy, and radical 
local treatment to metastatic sites are emerging as potential treatment options.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the diversity of metastatic NPC, a multimodality approach 
incorporating chemotherapy, immunotherapy, locoregional radiation and ablative 
treatment to metastatic sites has been shown to improve overall control. Further 
research is needed to determine the efficacy and optimal duration of maintenance 
therapy.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is a simple measure of assessing health differences 
between two or more populations but current life expectancy calculations are not 
reliable for small populations. A potential solution to this is to borrow 
strength from larger populations from the same source, but this has not formally 
been investigated.
METHODS: Using data on 451,222 individuals from the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink on the presence/absence of intellectual disability and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, we compared stratified and combined flexible parametric models, and 
Chiang's methods, for calculating life expectancy. Confidence intervals were 
calculated using the Delta method, Chiang's adjusted life table approach and 
bootstrapping.
RESULTS: The flexible parametric models allowed calculation of life expectancy 
by exact age and beyond traditional life expectancy age thresholds. The combined 
model that fit age interaction effects as a spline term provided less bias 
and greater statistical precision for small covariate subgroups by borrowing 
strength from the larger subgroups. However, careful consideration of the 
distribution of events in the smallest group was needed.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy is a simple measure to compare health differences 
between populations. The use of combined flexible parametric methods to 
calculate life expectancy in small samples has shown promising results by 
allowing life expectancy to be modelled by exact age, greater statistical 
precision, less bias and prediction of different covariate patterns without 
stratification. We recommend further investigation of their application for both 
policymakers and researchers.

As life expectancy increases, the effectiveness of cervical cancer screening 
programs needs to be reassessed for the older population. We addressed the 
effect of test history in and outside organized screening at age 50-64 years on 
later cervical cancer risk. A case-control study was conducted by deriving 229 
cases of 65-79 years old women with invasive cervical cancer in 2010-2019 from 
the Finnish Cancer Registry. Ten controls were matched for each case by birth 
year and hospital district. The effect of test uptake and abnormal results in 
50-64 year olds on cancer risk was investigated using conditional logistic 
regression and adjusted for self-selection. Test uptake within the 50-64 years 
age group showed 75% lower odds of cervical cancer [adjusted OR (aOR) = 0.25; 
95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.18-0.35]. Untested women had 4.9 times 
higher odds than those tested with normal results (aOR = 4.86; 95% CI, 
3.42-6.92). Having at least one abnormal test result increased the odds by 2.5 
when compared with only normal results but showed lower odds when compared with 
untested women. The importance of testing is exhibited by the result showing a 
reduction of odds of cancer to one-fourth for those tested compared with 
untested. Similarly, receiving abnormal results was protective of cancer 
compared with having no tests highlighting the importance of proper follow-up. 
Therefore, screening history should be considered when further developing 
cervical cancer screening programs with special interest in non-attenders and 
those receiving abnormal results at older ages.
SIGNIFICANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first study from Finnish data 
describing the effect of test history on later cervical cancer at older ages. 
Focusing on the cervical tests taken within the Finnish national screening 
program and outside it highlights the overall importance of having cervical 
tests and adds this study into the slowly increasing number of studies 
considering all cervical testing in Finland.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is currently one of the most common orthopedic 
surgeries due to the ever-increasing average life expectancy. The constant need 
for effective and accurate techniques was contributed to the development of 
three-dimensional (3D) printing in that field, especially for patient-specific 
instrumentation (PSI) and custom-made implants fabrication. PSI may offer 
numerous benefits, such as resection accuracy, mechanical axis alignment, 
cost-effectiveness, and time economy. Nonetheless, the results of existing 
studies are controversial. For this purpose, a review article of the published 
articles was conducted to summarize the role of 3D-printed PSI in TKA.

Smallholder farmers face several challenges that limit their access to markets 
and prevent them from taking advantage of market opportunities. This study 
sought to provide observed information on households' involvement in the output 
market and to analyse the determinants of the level of market participation 
among smallholder farmers in South Africa. Data (secondary) for this study were 
collected from a total of 1520 respondents who were selected through stratified 
random sampling. Descriptive statistics, t-test and a double-hurdle model were 
used to analyse factors influencing smallholder farmers' decisions regarding 
participation in the agricultural market. The first-hurdle equation of the 
double-hurdle model showed that gender of the household, family member working 
on the farm, wealth index, and agricultural assistance had a positive 
significant impact on the decision of smallholder farmers to participate in the 
market, while household age and family member with HIV had a negative 
significant impact. The results of the second-hurdle model showed marital 
status, educational level of household, wealth index, and access to agricultural 
assistance had a negative significant effect on the extent of market 
participation among smallholder farmers, while household size, household age, 
and family member with HIV had a positive significant impact. The suggestions 
emanating from the results as to what factors need to be addressed to encourage 
smallholder farmers to participate in the market indicate that there is a need 
for government to hire sufficient and skilled extension workers who understand 
the market related issues. With the help of extension workers and policymakers, 
government need to organize smallholder farmers into groups that are easy to 
manage, train, and support. Smallholder farmers' groups should have their 
farmers registered, visible, and easily accessible for coordinated government 
support services. They also need to do more workshops in rural areas to 
encourage young people to be involved in agriculture. This will lead to 
sustainable production, alleviation of poverty, improvement of the economy, and 
food security.

Calcium is imperative in maintaining a quality life, particularly during later 
ages. Its deficiency results in a wide range of metabolic disorders such as 
dental changes, cataracts, alterations in brain function, and osteoporosis. 
These deficiencies are more pronounced in females due to increased calcium 
turnover throughout their life cycle, especially during pregnancy and lactation. 
Vitamin D perform a central role in the metabolism of calcium. Recent scientific 
interventions have linked calcium with an array of metabolic disorders in 
females including hypertension, obesity, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, 
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), multiple sclerosis, and breast cancer. This 
review encompasses these female metabolic disorders with special reference to 
calcium and vitamin D deficiency. This review article aims to present and 
elaborate on available data regarding the worldwide occurrence of insufficient 
calcium consumption in females and allied health risks, to provide a basis for 
formulating strategies and population-level scientific studies to adequately 
boost calcium intake and position where required.

Addressing the disproportionate burden of food insecurity in South Africa 
requires targeted efforts to help smallholder farmers to access markets. The 
purpose of this study was to assess determinants of market participation and its 
contribution to household food security. The secondary data used in this study 
were collected from 1520 respondents; however, 389 smallholder farmers 
participated in the market. The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale revealed 
that out of the total sample size, 85% of the households were food insecure 
while 15% were food secure. Gender of household head, receiving social grants 
and higher wealth index positively impacted market participation. Having a 
family member with HIV had a negative impact on market participation among 
smallholder farmers. The results from the extended ordered probit regression 
model showed that household size, having a family member with HIV and 
agricultural assistance had a positive and significant contribution to the 
household food insecurity situation of the smallholder farmers. On the other 
hand, the educational level of household head, ownership of livestock, age of 
household head, gender of household head, and having access to social grants had 
a negative and significant effect on the food insecurity status. Access to 
education and the market can improve household food security. Linking 
smallholder farmers, particularly women and aged farmers, to markets should form 
an intrinsic part of the government's efforts to improve farming and food 
security and increase access to diversified food.

International experience reveals that food policy development often occurs in 
silos and offers few tangible mechanisms to address the interlinked, systemic 
issues underpinning food and nutrition insecurity. This paper investigated what 
South African government policies cover in terms of different aspects of the 
food system, who is responsible for them, and how coordinated they are. Policy 
objectives were categorized into seven policy domains relevant to food systems: 
agriculture, environment, social protection, health, land, education, economic 
development, and rural development. Of the ninety-one policies reviewed from 
1947-2017, six were identified as being "overarching" with goals across all the 
domains. About half of the policies focused on agriculture and the environment, 
reflecting an emphasis on agricultural production. Policies were formulated and 
implemented in silos. As a result, learning from implementation, and adjusting 
to improve impact has been limited. Particularly important is that coordination 
during implementation, across these complex domains, has been partial. In order 
to achieve its stated food and nutrition outcomes, including Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) 2, South Africa needs to translate its policies into 
tangible, practical plans and processes guided by effective coordination and 
alignment. Key recommendations are practically to align policies to a 
higher-level "food goal", establish better coordination mechanisms, consolidate 
an effective monitoring and evaluation approach to address data gaps and 
encourage learning for adaptive implementation. Actively engaging the existing 
commitments to the SDGs would draw stated international commitments together to 
meet the constitutional commitment to food rights into an overarching food and 
nutrition security law.

Providing economic opportunities for youth in agriculture is essential to 
securing the future of agriculture in Africa, addressing poverty, unemployment, 
and inequality. However, barriers limit youth participation in agriculture and 
the broader food system. This scoping review aimed to investigate the 
opportunities and challenges for youth in participating in agriculture and the 
food system in Africa. This review conducted a scoping review using the PRISMA 
guideline. Published studies were retrieved from online databases (Web of 
Science, Cab Direct, and Science Direct) for 2009 to 2019. The findings showed 
that existing agricultural interventions are production-centric and provide 
low-income earnings and inadequate social protection. We also found that the 
youth have pessimistic perceptions about agriculture's capability of improving 
their living standards. This could be ascribed to the minimal youth involvement 
in agricultural activities and the youth's shared understanding of the 
agricultural sector's contribution to general economic growth. From a policy 
perspective, the literature revealed that current agricultural development 
programs do not adequately address structural issues underpinning youth 
participation in the economy. Therefore, to enhance the involvement of youths in 
agriculture, there is a need for policy implementation in the area of integrated 
agricultural-based interventions that are context-specific and promote 
meaningful youth participation in shaping future food systems.

INTRODUCTION: High crop productivity has the potential to improve the food and 
nutrition security status of not only smallholder farmers but also households in 
general. However, smallholder farmers operate in a dynamic environment whereby 
their crop production is affected by various factors that hinder it from 
lessening food insecurity and malnutrition in rural areas. The study 
investigated the determinants of crop productivity and its effect on household 
food and nutrition security status in South Africa.
METHODS: This study employed a quantitative research method. A total of 1520 
households were selected using the multi-stage stratified random sampling 
technique. Out of the total sample size of 1520, 386 were crop producers, 176 
producers were from Mpumalanga province, and 210 producers were from the Limpopo 
province.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Most of the smallholder farmers do not have access to 
the irrigation system, mechanization, and agricultural inputs. The Household 
Food Insecurity Access Scale showed that most smallholder farmers were food 
insecure, with 78% of the farmers in each province found to be food insecure. 
The results from Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) showed that in the 
overall sampled population, 50% of smallholder farmers had highly diverse diets. 
Only 50% of the smallholder farmers had high dietary diversity in each province. 
Irrigation systems and involvement in crop production had a positive influence 
on the crop productivity of smallholder farmers. The results from the 
Conditional Mixed Process (CMP) model showed that ownership of livestock, 
harvest, and disability in the family negatively impacted smallholder farmers' 
food security status while household size had a positive effect on the food 
security of smallholder farmers. The results also showed that social grants, 
agricultural assistance, and harvest had a negative impact on the nutrition 
status of smallholder farmers. While household size had a positive impact on the 
nutrition status of smallholder farmers.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Factors such as irrigation systems and 
involvement in crop production influenced crop productivity. Household size 
influenced the nutritional status of smallholder farmers while harvest size 
affected the food security status. There is a need to encourage more households 
to get involved in farming. Government and nongovernmental organizations need to 
support smallholder farmers with agricultural productive resources like 
irrigation systems to improve their crop productivity.

Republic of Korea.

Stress has been shown to enhance elderly suicidal ideation. However, the effect 
of mindfulness and meaning in life on the relationship between stress and 
suicidal ideation in Korean baby boomers are still unknown. This study 
investigated (a) a significant correlation between the stress, suicidal 
ideation, mindfulness, and meaning in life, (b) the mediating effect of 
mindfulness in the association between stress and suicidal ideation, and (c) the 
serial mediating effect of mindfulness and then meaning in life on the 
relationship between stress and suicidal ideation. Data were collected from 200 
baby boomers (born between 1955-1963) concerning their stress, mindfulness, 
meaning in life, and suicidal ideation. These findings suggest that if 
interventions directed at baby boomers can successfully improve their 
mindfulness and by extension raise their meaning in life, suicidal ideation will 
decrease within their population.

OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer is the most challenging disease, and the level of 
resilience in patients determines their ability to cope with the arising stress. 
There is relatively limited information on the resilience of patients in 
clinical settings. Our study aims were to evaluate the extent of resilience and 
identify factors that predict resilience in women with breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with the 
participation of 218 women with breast cancer who were referred to the Oncology 
clinic in 2022. The participants completed three scales, namely the 
Conner-Davidson Resilience, Schneider's Life Expectancy, and the 
Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, along with sociodemographic 
information. Descriptive statistics, bivariate, and multiple linear regression 
were used to explore the predictors of resilience.
RESULT: The mean (SD) scores for resilience, social support, and hope were 59.22 
(17.25), 38.53 (6.19), and 59.37 (16.68), respectively. Based on analysis 50.8% 
of the variations in resilience could be explained by 6 variables including 
social support, hope, women's age, employment, and income status as well as the 
stage of illness (R2adj = 0.508, P < 0.001). Employment status and disease stage 
did not show a significant relationship with resilience and social support was 
the factor with the highest impact on resilience (β = 0.516, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our study showed social support, hope, age, and income level predict 
significant resilience in women with breast cancer. The findings emphasize the 
importance of fostering strong support networks, cultivating a hopeful mindset, 
embracing life's transitions, and addressing financial considerations in the 
pursuit of enhanced resilience.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to discuss pathophysiology, diagnosis, 
clinical presentation, and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral 
neuropathy. Agent-specific presentation and pathophysiology is also being 
discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: As new systemic oncological treatments continue to be 
developed, the number of cancer survivors continues to grow. Survivors are 
living longer with the long-term side effects of oncological treatments. We 
reviewed the pathophysiology of agent-specific chemotherapy-induced peripheral 
neuropathy and the updates in its treatment and preventative tools. 
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating long-term side 
effect that often impairs cancer survivors' function and quality of life. The 
increasing life expectancy of cancer survivors has resulted in increased 
prevalence of this condition. Understanding its intricacies can provide 
physicians with better treatment tools and research opportunities to develop or 
identify new therapeutic agents.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder in which sickle 
hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes, leading to red blood cell sickling and chronic 
hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive crises, and end-organ damage associated with 
early mortality. Despite standard of care, patients with SCD still experience 
complications and early mortality, highlighting remaining unmet treatment needs. 
Voxelotor is a first-in-class HbS polymerization inhibitor approved by the US 
Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for SCD and by the European 
Medicines Agency for hemolytic anemia due to SCD. In clinical studies, voxelotor 
has been shown to increase hemoglobin (Hb) and decrease hemolytic markers in 
patients with SCD. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of 
voxelotor on the burden of SCD in France using a modeling approach, accounting 
for its anticipated adoption and diffusion over the next 5 years. We designed a 
sequential multi-cohort model to project and compare the cumulative incidence of 
SCD complications over a 20-year time horizon in a world with and without 
voxelotor. A distribution of patients was simulated across various levels of Hb 
response based on the phase 3 HOPE trial results, and relative risk reduction 
was adjusted using published meta-analysis results that projected risk reduction 
due to a 1 g/dL increase in Hb. In 6100 modeled patients with SCD treated with 
voxelotor, the model projected the number of deaths to decrease by 39.4%, with 
an increase of 1.8% in life-years gained. The model also projected life
