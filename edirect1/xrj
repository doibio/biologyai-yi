Although newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) is widely advocated, hard 
evidence in its favor is difficult to obtain, partly because of a dramatically 
improved life expectancy. Between 1985--1989 infants, born in Wales and the West 
Midlands were randomized to newborn CF screening by heel-prick immunoreactive 
trypsin (IRT) measurement or diagnosis by clinical presentation. Eligible 
children with CF who died in the first 5 years of life were identified from the 
local pediatricians and from the National UK CF Survey. In all, 230,076 infants 
were randomized to be screened, while 234,510 were unscreened. One hundred 
seventy-six CF children were identified, of whom 7 died in the first 5 years of 
life, 3 having presented with meconium ileus. Median age of diagnosis in the 
screened group was 8 weeks. On an intention to treat analysis, all 4 nonmeconium 
ileus-related deaths occurred in the unscreened group (Fisher's exact test, P < 
0.05). However, the clinical presentation of 2 of these infants led to them 
being diagnosed prior to 8 weeks, i.e., earlier than would have been likely by 
screening. In conclusion, newborn screening has the potential to decrease infant 
CF deaths, but if it is to be successful, identification and treatment must 
occur as soon as possible after birth.

OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to investigate predictive factors related to the 
results, in terms of survival and quality of life, of palliative surgery in 
cancer patients presenting with intestinal obstruction.
METHODS: A total of 109 patients already treated for a neoplasm were operated on 
for intestinal obstruction between 1990 and 2000. The investigated prognostic 
factors were age, sex, location of the primary tumour, extension of the cancer 
at the time of the operation and the surgical procedure carried out. The impact 
on the quality of life was assessed by the resumption of intestinal transit and 
the return home.
RESULTS: The median survival rate was 64 days and the postoperative mortality 
rate 21%. The quality of life was improved in 65% of the patients. The only 
factors clearly correlated with survival and the success of the operation were 
the aetiological diagnosis of the intestinal obstruction and the type of 
procedure which was possible to carry out.
CONCLUSION: Palliative surgery may improve the quality of life of a certain 
number of patients, but it was not possible to demonstrate predictive factors 
for the selection of patients who could have the larger benefits of such 
surgery.

University of Turin, Via Baiardi 43, Turin 10126, Italy.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation between salpingoscopic and 
laparoscopic findings and their relation to reproductive outcomes.
DESIGN: Prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).
SETTING: University-affiliated hospital.
PATIENTS: Ninety-one infertile women.
INTERVENTION: Salpingoscopy and laparoscopy.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Salpingoscopic findings were expressed according 
to a widely used classification. Tubal morphology at laparoscopy was defined as 
regular (normal morphology), convoluted (any kind of distortion or adhesion), or 
hydrosalpinx. Laparoscopic and salpingoscopic findings did not correlate. 
Seventeen pregnancies occurred within 1 year from the procedures. According to 
life table analysis, the cumulative pregnancy rate was significantly higher in 
women with endotubal morphology showing minimal or no tubal damage, than in 
women with higher grades of endotubal damage. Conversely, tubal morphology at 
laparoscopy was not able to predict pregnancy outcome.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopy alone might not be sufficient to predict tubal 
integrity. Performing salpingoscopy with laparoscopy could significantly 
increase accuracy in predicting short-term fertility outcome. Given its low 
complication rate and brief duration, salpingoscopy should have a primary role 
in management of infertility.

Living donor liver transplantation for early hepatocellular carcinoma: A 
life-expectancy and cost-effectiveness perspective.

Cadaveric liver transplantation (CLT) is an excellent treatment for early 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its use, however, is limited by the shortage of 
grafts, with up to 30% of patients developing contraindications to the procedure 
while waiting for a donor. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has emerged 
as an alternative to overcome this limitation. We compared the consequences of 
LDLT versus CLT using a Markov model balancing the gains and losses in life 
expectancy among donors and recipients. For a 60-year-old recipient with a 70% 
5-year survival after transplantation, a 4% monthly drop-out rate, and a donor 
with 1% mortality, LDLT became more effective than CLT after 3.5 months on the 
waiting list. These results varied with the probability of developing 
contraindications to transplantation, the survival after transplantation, and 
the donor's mortality. For a 12-month delay saved on the waiting list, the gain 
in survival provided by LDLT compared with CLT ranged between 0 and 2.8 life 
years depending on survival after transplantation, time spent on the waiting 
list, and drop-out rate. LDLT was cost-effective (less than $50,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year saved) in all scenarios of waiting lists exceeding 7 
months, and this figure ranged from 2 to 16 months when varying the drop-out 
rate. LDLT for early HCC offered substantial gains in life expectancy with 
acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios when the waiting list exceeds 7 months. The 
gain in life expectancy and the cost-effectiveness of LDLT were more dependent 
on the drop-out rate and the outcome after transplantation than on donor's 
mortality.

Listing for lung transplantation: life expectancy and transplant effect, 
stratified by type of end-stage lung disease, the Eurotransplant experience.

BACKGROUND: Increased referral for lung transplantation, persistent shortage of 
donor lungs, and moderate transplant outcome call not only for adequate listing 
criteria, but also for an optimal allocation scheme. We used global cohort 
survival after listing and survival benefit from transplantation to study the 
effect of a lung allocation scheme, primarily driven by waiting time, on the 
different types of end-stage lung disease.
METHODS: We followed all adult patients consecutively listed for first, 
lung-only transplantation between 1990 and 1996 (n = 1,208) for at least 2 
years, with an additional 2-year follow-up after transplantation (n = 744). We 
used the competing risk method, the Kaplan-Meier method, and a time-dependent 
non-proportional hazards model to analyze waiting-list outcome and global 
mortality after listing, post-transplant survival, and transplant effect, 
respectively. Each analysis was stratified for type of end-stage lung disease.
RESULTS: At 2 years, 57% of the total cohort had received lung transplants, 
whereas 25% had died on the waiting list. The 2-year survival post-transplant 
was 55%. The global mortality of the cohort, since listing, amounted to 46% at 2 
years. Compared with continued waiting, patients experienced benefit from 
transplantation by Day 100, which lasted until the end of the 2-year analysis 
period. We noticed the highest global mortality rates for patients with 
pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension (54% and 52%); emphysema patients 
had the lowest (38%). Patients with pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis had 
much earlier benefit from transplantation, 55 and 90 days, respectively. 
Transplantation also benefited emphysema patients by Day 260.
CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantation conferred transplant benefit in a Western 
European cohort of adults, in particular for patients with pulmonary fibrosis 
and cystic fibrosis, but also for patients with emphysema. The global survival 
rate, reflecting the real life expectancy for a newly listed transplant 
candidate, is poor for patients with pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary 
hypertension. Allocation algorithms that lessen the impact of waiting time and 
take into account the type of end-stage lung disease should be developed.

Addition of salmeterol to low-dose fluticasone versus higher-dose fluticasone: 
an analysis of asthma exacerbations.

Matz J(1), Emmett A, Rickard K, Kalberg C.

Author information:
(1)Atlantic Asthma and Allergy Center, Inc, Baltimore, MD, USA.

BACKGROUND: Adding salmeterol to low-dose fluticasone propionate (FP) produces 
greater improvements in pulmonary function and symptom control than increasing 
the dose of FP in patients who remain symptomatic with low-dose FP.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the rates and characteristics of asthma 
exacerbations in patients after adding salmeterol to low-dose FP with the rates 
and characteristics of exacerbations in patients receiving higher dose FP.
METHODS: In 2 multicenter, double-blind studies, 925 patients 12 years of age 
and older receiving 88 microg twice daily FP randomly received either 42 microg 
of salmeterol and 88 microg of FP or an increased dose of FP (220 microg) twice 
daily for 24 weeks. Exacerbation rates and clinical measures of asthma worsening 
were assessed for all patients who experienced an asthma exacerbation.
RESULTS: The addition of salmeterol resulted in a significantly lower rate and 
number of exacerbations compared with higher dose FP. A total of 41 (8.8%) 
patients experienced 47 exacerbations with the addition of salmeterol compared 
with 63 (13.8%) patients with 75 exacerbations in the group receiving 
increased-dose FP (P =.017). Salmeterol plus low-dose FP was significantly more 
protective than increased-dose FP in preventing asthma exacerbations, as 
assessed by the time to first exacerbation (P <.05). In both groups clinical 
indicators of worsening asthma showed parallel changes before asthma 
exacerbation, and greater improvements were observed after exacerbation with 
salmeterol compared with higher dose FP.
CONCLUSION: Salmeterol plus low-dose FP was more effective than higher dose FP 
alone in reducing asthma exacerbations in patients with persistent asthma. The 
ability to detect deteriorating asthma and the severity of exacerbation was 
similar between groups.

BACKGROUND: With market failures characterizing the health care sector, 
societies are continuously searching for ways to achieve an efficient and fair 
allocation of resources. A natural source of opinion on the desired allocation 
of health resources is the public. In fact, several governments have recently 
involved the general public in decisions about resource allocation in their 
health systems.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the views of the Israeli Jewish public aged 45-75 on 
horizontal equity in medical care; specifically, the characteristics (including 
a lottery) for determining which of two individuals with similar medical need 
should be treated first, against a background of limited resources.
METHODS: A sample of 2,030 individuals was chosen to represent a population of 
about 800,000 urban Jewish Israelis aged 45-75. Data were collected in 
face-to-face full sit-down interviews by trained interviewers between October 
1993 and February 1994.
RESULTS: The three most preferred prioritizers were chances of recovery, number 
of dependants, and young age. Random prioritization was preferred by only 8% of 
the population. Age, level of education and religiosity were the main 
characteristics associated with the choice.
CONCLUSIONS: The Israeli adult public does not favor strict horizontal equity in 
health care. As in other social programs, "equals" were defined in a 
multi-criteria manner, based on both medical need and other personal 
characteristics. The preferred prioritizers seem to reflect universal tastes and 
cast doubt on the traditional distinction between efficiency and equity and 
between horizontal and vertical equity when applied to health care.

Prognostic factors, including clinical, biological, and histological parameters, 
were assessed for 94 patients with follicular lymphomas at our institute. 
Follicular lymphomas constituted 7.7% (94/1208) of malignant lymphomas in this 
study. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with stage I follicular lymphoma, 20 
with stage II, 23 with stage III, and 33 with stage IV. The cases of follicular 
lymphoma were subclassified as: follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma (FSC) in 
20 cases, follicular mixed cell lymphoma (FMX) in 59 cases, and follicular large 
cell lymphoma (FLC) in 15 cases. The patients comprised 49 men and 45 women with 
a median age of 54 years (range, 25-84 years). The complete response rate was 
76.5%, and the median survival time was 13 years. The expected 10-year overall 
survival and event-free survival rates were 61.9% and 38.2%, respectively. 
Univariate analysis identified the factors associated with poor survival as 
elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P < .0001), age of >60 (P < 
.0001), Ann Arbor stage III/IV (P < .01), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status (PS) of 2 to 4 (P = .048). Multivariate analysis showed that 
LDH, age, and PS were independent predictors. After application of the 
International Prognostic Index (IPI), the 10-year survival rates for the 
low-risk, low-intermediate risk, high-intermediate risk and high-risk groups 
were 80.4%, 48.7%, 21.9%, and 0.0%, respectively. The differences among these 
groups were significant at P < .01. The IPI for aggressive non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma was found to be applicable to survival prediction for Japanese 
follicular lymphoma patients.

Asthma patients, in their daily life, may experience 3 different situations 
needing 3 types of management: attack (which is an emergency issue); post-attack 
period (very often under-diagnosed and under-treated, what is one of the major 
relapse factors); stable state (which should be the "natural" state of any 
chronic patient). Despite the availability of very active treatments, asthma 
still represents an handicap for many patients, and mortality rates go 
unchanged. All this has lead to issue asthma severity scales and consensus 
therapeutic management guidelines. Promoting and implementing these guidelines 
is the only way for improving asthma management.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the patterns of care and management of testicular cancer 
in Victoria.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis of all cases of testicular cancer in 
Victoria from 1988 to 1993 identified through the Victorian Cancer Registry.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Description of patient characteristics, staging 
investigations, initial management, and outcome.
RESULTS: 667 eligible cases of testicular cancer were identified and 
questionnaires were returned for 633 of these patients (94.9% response rate). 
There were 357 (56.4%) patients with pure seminoma; 271 (42.8%) with 
non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, 3 (0.5%) with stromal tumours, and 2 (0.3%) 
with other tumours. The median age was 32 years (range, 0-80 years). 
Preoperative marker levels were not available for 8% of patients, and initial 
staging was considered inadequate in 6%. Surveillance programs used for patients 
with Stage I disease were considered inadequate in most. Relative survival at 
five years was 99% for patients with seminoma and 91% for non-seminoma.
CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable variation in the investigation, treatment, 
and follow-up of these patients, which is likely to have resulted in unnecessary 
morbidity. Clinical practice guidelines should be developed and implemented to 
promote optimal management.

    Diabetes Care. 2001 May;24(5):801-2.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate long-term mortality and its temporal trends as of 1 
January 1999 among the 1,075 patients with type 1 diabetes (onset age <18 years, 
diagnosed between 1965 and 1979) who comprise the Allegheny County 
population-based registry.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overall, sex- and race-specific mortality rates per 
person-year of follow-up were determined. Standardized mortality ratios were 
also calculated. Survival analyses and Cox proportional hazard model were also 
used. Temporal trends were examined by dividing the cohort into three groups by 
year of diagnosis (1965-1969, 1970-1974, and 1975-1979).
RESULTS: Living status of 972 cases was ascertained as of January 1, 1999 
(ascertainment rate 90.4%). The mean duration of diabetes was 25.2 +/- 5.8 (SD) 
years. Overall, 170 deaths were observed. The crude mortality rate was 627 per 
100,000 person-years (95% CI 532-728) and standardized mortality ratio was 519 
(440-602). Life-table analyses by the Kaplan-Meier method indicated cumulative 
survival rates of 98.0% at 10 years, 92.1% at 20 years, and 79.6% at 30 years 
duration of diabetes. There was a significant improvement in the survival rate 
between the cohort diagnosed during 1965-1969 and that diagnosed during 
1975-1979 by the log-rank test (P = 0.03). Mortality was higher in 
African-Americans than in Caucasians, but there were no differences seen by sex. 
The improvement in recent years was seen in both ethnic groups and sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: An improvement in long-term survival was observed in the more 
recently diagnosed cohort. This improvement is consistent with the introduction 
of HbA1 testing, home blood glucose monitoring, and improved blood pressure 
therapy in the 1980s.

Are aggressive treatment strategies less cost-effective for older patients? The 
case of ventilator support and aggressive care for patients with acute 
respiratory failure.

OBJECTIVES: A common assumption is that life-sustaining treatments are much less 
cost-effective for older patients than for younger patients. We estimated the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of providing mechanical ventilation and intensive 
care for patients of various ages who had acute respiratory failure.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data on acute respiratory failure from Study 
to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments 
(SUPPORT).
SETTING: Acute hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: 1,005 with acute respiratory failure; 963 received ventilator 
support and 42 had ventilator support withheld.
MEASUREMENTS: We studied 1,005 patients enrolled in a five-center study of 
seriously ill patients (SUPPORT) with acute respiratory failure (pneumonia or 
acute respiratory distress syndrome and an Acute Physiology Score > or = 10) 
requiring ventilator support. For cost-effectiveness analyses, we estimated life 
expectancy based on long-term follow-up of SUPPORT patients and estimated 
utilities (quality-of-life weights) using time-tradeoff questions. We used 
hospital fiscal data and Medicare data to estimate healthcare costs. We divided 
patients into three age groups (< 65, 65-74, and > or = 75 years); for each age 
group, we performed separate analyses for patients with a < or = 50% probability 
of surviving at least 2 months (high-risk group) and those with a > 50% 
probability of surviving at least 2 months (low-risk group).
RESULTS: Of the 963 patients who received ventilator support, 44% were female; 
48% survived 6 months; and the median (25th, 75th percentile) age was 63 (46, 
75) years. For the 42 patients for whom ventilator support was withheld, the 
median survival was 3 days. For low-risk patients (> 50% estimated 2-month 
survival), the incremental cost (1998 dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) saved by providing ventilator support and aggressive care increased 
across the three age groups ($32,000 for patients age < 65, $44,000 for those 
age 65-74, and $46,000 for those age > or = 75). For high-risk patients, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness was much less favorable and was least favorable 
for younger patients ($130,000 for patients age < 65, $100,000 for those age 
65-74, and $96,000 for those age > or = 75). When we varied our assumptions from 
50% to 200% of our baseline estimates in sensitivity analyses, results were most 
sensitive to the costs of the index hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with relatively good short-term prognoses, we found 
that ventilator support and aggressive care were economically worthwhile, even 
for patients 75 years and older. For patients with poor short-term prognoses, 
ventilator support and aggressive care were much less cost-effective for adults 
of all ages.

Relative risks computed from known breast cancer risk factors can be used to 
quantitate a woman's individual risk of developing breast cancer. However, among 
older women the absolute risk of developing breast cancer over a specified time 
interval may be more useful in risk-benefit counseling. The objective of this 
investigation is to characterize the relationships between relative risks and 
absolute risks of breast cancer among a population of rural, older African 
American women. Among 224 African American women aged 50-91 years, relative 
risks were computed from historical information on age at menarche, number of 
previous biopsies, age at first birth, and number of first-degree relatives with 
breast cancer. These estimates, combined with the woman's current age, average 
remaining life expectancy, age-specific mortality, and breast cancer incidence 
rates, were used to estimate lifetime probabilities of developing breast cancer. 
Most women in the cohort (72.8%) had weak relative risks of 1.01-1.5 and only 
3.5% of the women had relative risks of greater than 3.0. The majority of the 
women (87.5%) had lifetime probabilities of developing breast cancer that were 
less than 5%. Although there is a marked increase in age-specific breast cancer 
incidence with age, the probability of developing breast cancer in this 
population is low, primarily due to the low relative risks and the effects of 
competing mortality at older ages. Screening mammography should be directed 
toward women with high risks who are not receiving regular screening mammograms.

BACKGROUND: The study of mortality of human groups is important to judge the 
health conditions of population.
AIM: To study the main mortality features among Chilean adults.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Information about mortality in Chile from the Instituto 
nacional de Estadísticas and The World Health Organization, was analyzed. Data 
was expressed mainly as rates.
RESULTS: Annual mortality risk among Chileans is 812 per 100,000 inhabitants and 
is low compared to the rest of Latin America. In the last 30 years it has 
decreased systematically at a rate of 1% per year in both genders. The risk of 
mortality caused by cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hepatic 
cirrhosis, gastric cancer and tuberculosis has decreased. On the other hand, the 
risk of mortality caused by diabetes, hypertension and lung, gallbladder, 
prostate and colorectal cancer has increased. Mortality varies from 604 per 
100,000 in Atacama to 934 per 100,000 in Valparaiso. The most factor that 
influences this variation is population aging. Mean survival at the start of 
adulthood is 54 years in men and 61 years in women. At 60 years, the expectancy 
is 19 and 24 years respectively. Mean age of death in Chile was 71.5 years in 
1998. Seventy six percent of deaths occurs in the elderly and 33%, in people of 
80 years or more.
CONCLUSIONS: Chile is one of the four Latin American countries with lower 
mortality risk. In the last 30 years, the main causes of deaths among adults, 
with exception of pneumonia, have decreased. Therefore health care of the adult 
is in the correct track (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128: 1144-49).

[Short and long term results of aortic valve replacement in patients 80 years of 
age and older].

BACKGROUND: Due to demographic changes in average life expectancy the age of 
patients undergoing cardiac surgery is increasing as well. We have reviewed the 
short- and long-term outcome in patients over 80 years of age after aortic valve 
replacement with or without concomitant coronary grafting.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: From 1.1.1995 until 31.12.1999, 126 patients (93 women, 33 
men between 80 and 89 years, 82.8 +/- 2.4) underwent aortic valve replacement. 
64 patients (group A) received isolated valve replacement, 62 (group B) 
underwent myocardial revascularization as well.
RESULTS: The 30-day hospital mortality rate was 6.3% for group A and 14.5% for 
group B. The follow-up time ranged between 3 and 63 months (32 +/- 16). None of 
the patients had to be reoperated for prosthetic valve dysfunction or 
endocarditis. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy were 
observed by one patient from group A 3 years after the operation. Of the 15 
deaths during the follow-up period seven (47%) were cardiac in nature and two 
(13%) related to stroke. Acturial survival rates for group A were 89%, 85% and 
77% at 1, 2 and 3 years, and for group B 76%, 72% and 70%. Permanent nursing 
care was not required 1 year after the operation by 100% of patients in group A 
(2 years: 98%, 3 years 95%) and by 100% of patients in group B (2 years: 93%, 3 
years: 90%). At an interval of 1 year after the operation 96% of patients in 
group A had not been hospitalized as a result of cardiac disorders (2 years: 
96%, 3 years: 94%). The rates for group B were 88%, 81% and 75%.
CONCLUSION: Compared with younger age groups, aortic valve replacement in 
patients 80 years of age and older is associated with a distinctly increased 
mortality and morbidity. However, our data suggest that considering the poor 
prognosis of conservative therapy of symptomatic aortic valve disease, 
functional status as well as life expectancy in this age group seem to be 
positively influenced by aortic valve replacement.

Flt3 ligand (FL) treatment of murine donors does not modify graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD) but FL treatment of recipients post-bone marrow transplantation 
accelerates GVHD lethality.

Flt3 ligand (FL) is a hematopoietic cytokine that has been shown to facilitate 
the expansion of dendritic cells (DCs) and the generation of antitumor immune 
responses. In addition, the use of FL in mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor 
cells is being investigated. In the present study, we sought to quantify the 
influence of FL-treated donor cells on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). FL 
treatment resulted in a marked expansion in the absolute number of myeloid- and 
lymphoid-related DCs and a reduction in the proportion of donor splenic T cells. 
Irradiated recipients who were given splenocytes from FL-treated donors had 
reduced GVHD lethality compared with controls due to the infusion of fewer 
mature T cells. Highly purified T cells from FL-treated donors produced 
comparable in vitro alloresponses and there was no evidence of a skewing toward 
T-helper type 1 (interleukin [IL]-2, interferon-gamma) or T-helper type 2 (IL-4, 
IL-10) cytokine production. The GVHD lethality associated with purified T cells 
obtained from FL-treated or control donors was comparable. In contrast, FL 
treatment of recipients resulted in a significant increase in GVHD lethality. 
Increased lethality was observed even when the infusions of allogeneic T cells 
and FL were delayed until 3 weeks post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Our 
data indicate that FL treatment of donors does not increase GVHD risk, but 
treatment of recipients increases GVH lethality even if FL treatment is delayed 
until later post-BMT.

UK. S.Cunningham@eastman.ucl.ac.uk

OBJECTIVE: To determine utility and willingness to pay (WTP) values for patients 
undergoing orthognathic treatment in a National Health Service hospital in the 
United Kingdom and to establish whether WTP values can be used as a measure of 
strength of preference.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients who were about to start orthognathic treatment were 
recruited over a 10-month period between January and October 1998.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Utility values were obtained using the standard gamble method 
and WTP values were determined using a payment card method. The relationship 
between the two was assessed.
RESULTS: The mean utility value was 0.73 and the mean WTP was 6,833 pounds. The 
correlation between these two measures was -0.46 (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between the utility and WTP values was in the 
expected direction thus suggesting that WTP may be used as a measure of strength 
of preference. Therefore, willingness to pay may be a useful technique to 
combine with cost utility analysis.

(1)Department of Surgery, University Medical Centre Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in assessing the impact of a disease and 
the effect of a treatment on a patient's life, expressed as health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL). HRQoL assessment can provide essential outcome 
information for cancer surgery.
METHODS: The core of this review is derived from a literature search of the 
Medline database.
RESULTS: Three types of HRQoL instrument can be distinguished: generic, disease 
specific and symptom specific. There are criteria against which HRQoL 
instruments may be evaluated. The instrument chosen must be reliable, valid and 
sensitive to change.
CONCLUSION: HRQoL measurement may be useful in identifying the optimal surgical 
procedure. It may also be of help in deciding whether surgery in patients with 
limited life expectancy should still be considered. No HRQoL instrument fits all 
the recommended conditions or is suitable in all clinical situations. Using the 
appropriate instrument is essential to arrive at valid and clinically meaningful 
outcome measures.

Cost-utility analysis of open versus laparoscopic groin hernia repair: results 
from a multicentre randomized clinical trial.

Medical Research Council Laparoscopic Groin Hernia Trial Group..

Comment in
    Br J Surg. 2001 Nov;88(11):1543-5.

BACKGROUND: This study was a pragmatic economic evaluation carried out alongside 
a multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing laparoscopic with open groin 
hernia repair. The primary economic evaluation framework employed was a 
cost-utility analysis.
METHODS: At 26 hospitals in the UK and Ireland, 928 patients with a groin hernia 
were assigned randomly to laparoscopic or open repair. Cost data were identified 
and measured both within and outwith the trial. Cost data were combined with 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from the EQ-5D questionnaire to obtain 
cost-per-QALY ratios.
RESULTS: The mean cost of laparoscopic hernia repair was pound1112.64, compared 
with pound788.79 for the open operation. The extra cost of pound323.85 in the 
laparoscopic group was mainly due to additional theatre time and increased 
equipment and sterilization costs. The estimated incremental cost per QALY of 
the laparoscopic over the open method was pound55 548.00 (95 per cent confidence 
interval pound47 216.00- pound63 885.00).
CONCLUSION: While the results show that a high cost was incurred to produce an 
additional QALY by using laparoscopic over open hernia repair, sensitivity 
analyses show that there are specific situations in which laparoscopic repair 
may be a viable alternative, such as when reusable equipment is employed.

    Ann Intern Med. 2006 Sep 5;145(5):361-3; discussion 392.

BACKGROUND: Social status is an important predictor of poor health. Most studies 
of this issue have focused on the lower echelons of society.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the increase in status from winning an academy 
award is associated with long-term mortality among actors and actresses.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis.
SETTING: Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
PARTICIPANTS: All actors and actresses ever nominated for an academy award in a 
leading or a supporting role were identified (n = 762). For each, another cast 
member of the same sex who was in the same film and was born in the same era was 
identified (n = 887).
MEASUREMENTS: Life expectancy and all-cause mortality rates.
RESULTS: All 1649 performers were analyzed; the median duration of follow-up 
time from birth was 66 years, and 772 deaths occurred (primarily from ischemic 
heart disease and malignant disease). Life expectancy was 3.9 years longer for 
Academy Award winners than for other, less recognized performers (79.7 vs. 75.8 
years; P = 0.003). This difference was equal to a 28% relative reduction in 
death rates (95% CI, 10% to 42%). Adjustment for birth year, sex, and ethnicity 
yielded similar results, as did adjustments for birth country, possible name 
change, age at release of first film, and total films in career. Additional wins 
were associated with a 22% relative reduction in death rates (CI, 5% to 35%), 
whereas additional films and additional nominations were not associated with a 
significant reduction in death rates.
CONCLUSION: The association of high status with increased longevity that 
prevails in the public also extends to celebrities, contributes to a large 
survival advantage, and is partially explained by factors related to success.

BACKGROUND: Interferon therapy decreases the incidence of hepatocellular 
carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effects of interferon-alpha on recurrence after resection 
of hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial.
SETTING: University hospital, medical center, and affiliated hospital in Osaka, 
Japan.
PATIENTS: 30 men were randomly allocated after resection to the interferon-alpha 
group (n = 15) or the control group (n = 15).
INTERVENTION: Patients in the interferon-alpha group received interferon-alpha, 
6 MIU intramuscularly daily for 2 weeks, then three times weekly for 14 weeks, 
and finally twice weekly for 88 weeks.
MEASUREMENTS: Recurrence rates after resection.
RESULTS: Recurrent tumors were detected in 5 patients in the interferon-alpha 
group and in 12 control patients. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in 
the interferon-alpha group than in the control group (P = 0.037).
CONCLUSION: Postoperative interferon-alpha therapy appears to decrease 
recurrence after resection of hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular 
carcinoma.

Worker life tables, survivorship, and longevity in colonies of Bombus 
(Fervidobombus) atratus (Hymenoptera: Apidae).

Survivorship curves and longevity of workers were studied in two queenright and 
two queenless colonies of Bombus (Fervidobombus) atratus. Survivorship curves 
for workers of all colonies were, in general, convex, indicating an increasing 
mortality rate with increasing age. The mean longevity for the workers from 
queenright colonies, 24.3 days and 17.6 days, was not significantly different 
from that in queenless colonies, 21.2 days and 20.2 days. In all colonies 
workers started foraging activities when aged 0-5 days, and the potential 
forager rates rose progressively with increasing age. Mortality rates within 
each age interval were significantly correlated with the foraging worker rates 
in all colonies. Only in two of the colonies (one queenright and one queenless) 
longevity was significantly correlated with worker size. The duration of brood 
development period seems to be one of the most important factors influencing 
adult worker longevity in bumble bee species.

PURPOSE: A phase I followed by a phase II trial utilizing rIL-2, IFN alpha, and 
5-FU were conducted in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma.
METHODS: Treatment consisted of: rIL-2 at 5.0 x 10(6) IU/m2 SQ on days 1-5 for 4 
weeks, rHUIFN alpha-2a at 5.0 x 10(6) U/m2 SQ on days 1, 3, and 5 for 4 weeks, 
and 5-FU by IV bolus on days 1-5 during week 1. In the phase I study, patients 
were treated at varying doses of 5-FU: I-none, II-250 mg/m2, III-300, and IV 
375. A phase II trial was then conducted utilizing the same schedule and maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) for 5-FU.
RESULTS: Twenty patients were entered into the phase I trial. Dose-limiting 
toxicity included grade III nausea and vomiting, and one sudden cardiac death. 
The MTD for 5-FU was determined to be 300 mg/m2. In the phase II trial, a median 
of two cycles of therapy was administered to 25 evaluable patients. Toxicity was 
moderate and consisted primarily of fevers, chills, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, 
and anorexia. Grade IV thrombocytopenia, consistent with ITP, developed in one 
patient each on the phase I and phase II trial. Seven partial responses were 
seen among 25 patients treated in the phase II trial for a 28% (CI 12-49%) 
response rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of 5-FU to rIL-2 and rHuIFN alpha-2a appears to 
increase the toxicity of this therapy. Randomized trials will be required to 
determine if efficacy is enhanced.

What's new in rheumatoid arthritis? An evidenced based review.

Ostor AJ(1), McColl GJ.

Author information:
(1)Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory arthritis 
and has been associated with significant functional impairment and a shortened 
life expectancy. Fortunately, over the past 10 years, there has been a 
significant change in its management, which has resulted in improved outcomes 
for RA patients.
OBJECTIVE: To critically appraise the recent evidence which affects the 
contemporary management of RA.
DISCUSSION: The bulk of recent evidence suggests that disease modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be commenced early and continued 
indefinitely in RA patients. Single DMARD therapy may be sufficient in some 
patients but combinations, particularly those which include methotrexate, 
improve symptomatic and radiological outcomes. The use of newer therapies, 
including leflunomide and tumour necrosis factor-alpha blocking drugs, promise 
to further improve these outcomes.

Glioblastoma multiforme is the most malignant astrocytic glioma and usually 
resistant to chemotherapy. A small fraction of glioblastomas may contain areas 
with histological features of oligodendroglial differentiation. To determine the 
molecular genetic alterations in such "glioblastomas with oligodendroglial 
component", we investigated 13 of these tumors for genetic alterations and/or 
expression of the TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, and EGFR genes. In addition, we performed 
microsatellite analyses for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome arms 1p, 
19q and 10q. None of tumors showed evidence for LOH on 10q. LOH on 1p was 
detected in 3 tumors, 1 of which additionally showed LOH on 19q. The 3 tumors 
with LOH on 1p showed neither TP53 mutations nor nuclear p53 accumulation. In 
contrast, 9 of 10 tumors without demonstrated losses on 1p showed nuclear p53 
accumulation. TP53 mutations were identified in 3 of these cases. Further 
aberrations detected were epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression 
(3 of 13 tumors), homozygous CDKN2A deletion (2 of 11 tumors), and PTEN mutation 
(1 of 13 tumors). Taken together, our results indicate that "glioblastomas with 
oligodendroglial component" carry heterogeneous genetic alterations. LOH on 10q, 
PTEN mutation, and homozygous CDKN2A deletion appear to be less common in these 
tumors as compared to ordinary glioblastomas. Furthermore, a subset of these 
tumors demonstrates LOH on 1p, i.e., an alteration that has recently been linked 
to chemosensitivity and good prognosis in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas.
