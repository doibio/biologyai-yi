Antibiotic is one of the most significant discoveries and have brought a 
revolution in the field of medicine for human therapy. In addition to the 
medical uses, antibiotics have broad applications in agriculture and animal 
husbandry. In developing nations, antibiotics use have helped to increase the 
life expectancy by lowering the deaths due to bacterial infections, but the 
risks associated with antibiotics pollution is largely affecting people. Since 
antibiotics are released partially degraded and undegraded into environment 
creating antibiotic pollution, and its bioremediation is a challenging task. In 
the present review, we have discussed the primary antibiotic sources like 
hospitals, dairy, and agriculture causing antibiotic pollution and their 
innovative detection methods. The strong commitment towards the resistance 
prevention and participation, nations through strict policies and their 
implementations now come to fight against the antibiotic resistance under WHO. 
The review also deciphers the bacterial evolution based strategies to overcome 
the effects of antibiotics, so the antibiotic degradation and elimination from 
the environment and its health benefits. The present review focuses on the 
environmental sources of antibiotics, it's possible degradation mechanisms, 
health effects, and bacterial antibiotics resistance mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Since 2007, the German statutory health insurance covers Specialized 
Outpatient Palliative Care (SAPV). SAPV offers team-based home care for patients 
with advanced and progressive disease, complex symptoms and life expectancy 
limited to days, weeks or months. The introduction of SAPV is ruled by a 
directive (SAPV directive). Within this regulation, SAPV delivery models can and 
do differ regarding team structures, financing models, cooperation with other 
care professionals and processes of care. The research project SAVOIR is funded 
by G-BA's German Innovations Fund to evaluate the implementation of the SAPV 
directive.
METHODS: The processes, content and quality of SAPV will be evaluated from the 
perspectives of patients, SAPV teams, general practitioners and other care 
givers and payers. The influence of different contracts, team and network 
structures and regional and geographic settings on processes and results 
including patient-reported outcomes will be analyzed in five subprojects: [1] 
structural characteristics of SAPV and their impact on patient care, [2] quality 
of care from the perspective of patients, [3] quality of care from the 
perspective of SAPV teams, hospices, ambulatory nursing services, nursing homes 
and other care givers, content and extent of care from [4] the perspective of 
General Practitioners and [5] from the perspective of payers. The evaluation 
will be based on different types of data: team and organizational structures, 
treatment data based on routine documentation with electronic medical record 
systems, prospective assessment of patient-reported outcomes in a sample of SAPV 
teams, qualitative interviews with other stakeholders like nursing and hospice 
services, a survey in general practitioners and a retrospective analysis of 
claims data of all SAPV patients, covered by the health insurance fund BARMER in 
2016.
DISCUSSION: Data analysis will allow identification of variables, associated 
with quality of SAPV. Based on these findings, the SAVOIR study group will 
develop recommendations for the Federal Joint Committee for a revision of the 
SAPV directive.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS): DRKS00013949

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women in developed 
countries. The traditional modifiable risk factors are able to explain the 
majority of CVD mortality. The aim of this review is to analyze gender-specific 
aspects of major conventional cardiovascular risk factors and to assess whether 
they have the same impact on CVD in women. Cigarette smoking remains the single 
largest preventable cause of cardiovascular morbidity and premature death 
worldwide. Women smoke less than men; however, smoking seems to be more harmful 
in women, particularly in oral contraceptive users. Obesity in the general 
population is more prevalent in women. Visceral adiposity is associated with 
insulin resistance and a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Life 
expectancy in female diabetic patients is shorter than in men with diabetes; 
women with diabetes are also at higher risk of developing cardiovascular events. 
Changes of main lipid parameters in women are frequently associated with their 
hormonal status and/or hormonal treatment. Hypertension is highly prevalent in 
post-menopausal women and carries a higher risk of developing left ventricular 
hypertrophy, which, together with a greater increase in vascular and myocardial 
stiffness, results in a higher incidence of heart failure with preserved 
ejection fraction and a higher risk of developing stroke. The risk of abdominal 
aortic rupture is substantially higher in women. In conclusion, smoking, 
diabetes and hypertension seem to be more harmful in women. Therefore, the 
question is whether there should not be lower thresholds for initiating drug 
treatment in women with diabetes and hypertension.

Diabetes, a metabolic disease with vascular consequences due to accelerated 
atherosclerosis, is one of the 21st century's most prevalent chronic diseases. 
Characterized by inability to produce or use insulin, leading to hyperglycemia 
and insulin deficiency, diabetes causes a variety of microvascular (such as 
retinopathy and kidney disease) and macrovascular complications (including 
myocardial infarction and stroke) which reduce the quality of life and life 
expectancy of individuals with diabetes. We describe the close relationship 
between diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors, and cardiovascular disease, and 
examine multifactorial approaches to diabetes treatment, including reducing 
cardiovascular risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Finally, we analyze new 
prospects for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, resulting from the development 
of novel antidiabetic drugs. The aim of this review is that the clinician should 
assume the crucial role of guiding individuals with diabetes in the control of 
their disease, in order to improve their quality of life and prognosis. In view 
of the currently available evidence, the emergence of new glucose-reducing 
therapies with proven cardiovascular benefit means that the best therapeutic 
strategy for diabetes must go beyond reducing hyperglycemia and aim to reduce 
cardiovascular risk.

The growing production and extensive use of organophosphate flame retardants 
(OPFRs) have led to an increase in their environmental distribution and human 
exposure. Developmental toxicity is a major concern of OPFRs' adverse health 
effects. However, the impact of OPFRs exposure on vascular development and the 
toxicity pathway for developmental defects are poorly understood. In this study, 
we investigated the effects of exposure to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate 
(TDCPP), a frequently detected OPFR, on early vascular development, and the 
possible role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2)-dependent 
angiogenic pathway in TDCPP's vascular toxicity. TDCPP exposure at 300 and 
500 μg/L impeded the growth of intersegmental vessels (ISV), a type of 
microvessels, as early as 30 hpf. Consistently, a similar pattern of decreased 
extension and remodeling of common cardinal vein (CCV), a typical macrovessel, 
was observed in zebrafish at 48 hpf and 72 hpf. Developing vasculature in 
zebrafish was more sensitive than general developmental parameters to TDCPP 
exposure. The expression of genes related to VEGF signaling pathway 
dose-dependently decreased in TDCPP-treated larvae. In in vitro experiments 
using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the increased cell 
proliferation induced by VEGF was suppressed by TDCPP exposure in a 
dose-dependent fashion. In addition, we found a repression of Nrf2 expression 
and activity in TDCPP-treated larvae and HUVECs. Strikingly, the application of 
CDDO-Im, a potent Nrf2 activator, enhanced VEGF and protected against defective 
vascular development in zebrafish. Our results reveal that vascular impairment 
is a sensitive index for early exposure to TDCPP, which could be considered in 
the environmental risk assessment of OPFRs. The identification of Nrf2-mediating 
VEGF pathway provides new insight into the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) of 
OPFRs.

PURPOSE: STOPPFrail criteria highlight instances of potentially inappropriate 
medications (PIMs) in frailer older adults with poor 1-year survival prognosis. 
The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the proportion of older 
adults requiring long-term nursing care in whom STOPPFrail criteria are 
applicable, (ii) measure the prevalence of STOPPFrail PIMs, and (iii) identify 
risk factors for PIMs in this cohort.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed applications for long-term nursing care to 
nursing homes in the Cork area over a 6-month period. We recorded diagnoses, 
medications, functional status, cognitive ability, frailty status, and applied 
STOPPFrail criteria as appropriate.
RESULTS: We reviewed 464 applications; 38 were excluded due to incomplete 
information and 274 patients (64.3%) met STOPPFrail eligibility criteria (median 
age 83 years (IQR 77.25-88); 233 (54.7%) female). Those STOPPFrail eligible were 
prescribed 2194 medications (mean 8, (SD 4)), of which 828 (37.7%) were PIMs. At 
least one PIM was identified in 250 eligible patients (91.2%). The median number 
of PIMs was 3 (IQR 2-4), the most common being (i) medications without clear 
indication identified in 47.0% (n = 129) of patients, (ii) long-term high-dose 
proton pump inhibitors in 31.4% (n = 86), and (iii) statins in 29.6% (n = 81). 
For every additional medication prescribed, the odds of identifying a PIM 
increased by 58% (odds ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.32-1.89, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Almost 65% of patients awaiting long-term care are eligible for the 
application of STOPPFrail criteria with over 90% prescribed at least one PIM. 
Transition to nursing home care represents an opportunity to review therapeutic 
appropriateness and goals of prescribed medications.

Collagenase injections for Dupuytren's contracture: prospective cohort study in 
a public health setting.

R(1)(2).

Author information:

Queensland, Australia.
(2)School of Medicine, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease causes a flexion contracture of the hand that 
limits hand function and reduces quality of life. Traditional management is 
surgical excision which is associated with potentially serious complications. A 
viable alternative is collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) (Xiaflex®; 
Pfizer Australia) which is an effective, safe, outpatient treatment that to date 
has no published data in the Australian public health setting.
METHODS: A prospective cohort, single centre study, enrolling 54 patients to 
treat 81 joints with CCH. Patients received a single dose to the cord followed 
by joint manipulation 48 h later. Primary endpoint was reduction in contracture 
to 0 to 5° of full extension assessed 4 weeks after injection. Secondary 
endpoints included range of motion, patient satisfaction and function as 
measured by the Southampton Dupuytren's Scoring Scheme (SDSS).
RESULTS: Primary endpoint was achieved in 48% of joints (66% metacarpophalangeal 
and 19% proximal interphalangeal). Mean flexion contracture improved by 40o and 
25o for metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, respectively. 
Mean active range of motion improved by 39o and 18o , respectively. At 30 days 
and 12 months, SDSS score demonstrated sustained improvement versus baseline 
(1.88 versus 8.24 P ≤ 0.0005 and 1.59 versus 8.07 P ≤ 0.0005). Sixty-eight 
percent of patients were either very satisfied or satisfied at 12-month 
follow-up. Side effects of treatment were minor; with oedema and bruising the 
most common (87% and 85%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: CCH injections are a viable treatment for Dupuytren's contracture in 
the Australian public health setting.

(PE2) , University of Groningen , Groningen , Netherlands.

INTRODUCTION: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) reflects an increasing burden and 
can affect public health policy. Vaccination could be the most effective option 
to reduce the disease burden, this review can support national recommendations 
for TBE vaccination in Slovenia.
AREAS COVERED: This burden is relatively high in Slovenia and can be estimated 
by using an incidence-based disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) methodology. 
Notably, DALYs have been estimated for Slovenia in various studies. The present 
study summarizes the main differences and conclusions between two studies that 
dealt with the calculation of DALYs for TBE in Slovenia. The databases of PubMed 
and Embase were used to get information about publications that dealt with the 
TBE burden, using an incidence-based DALYs methodology, in Slovenia.
EXPERT OPINION: Permanent sequelae contribute the most to the total burden in 
DALYs. Increasing vaccination in all ages and age groups can be the most 
effective and efficient strategy to reduce the burden of TBE and protect the 
whole population health.

The cost-effectiveness of canakinumab for secondary prevention of cardiovascular 
disease: The Australian healthcare perspective.

BACKGROUND: Canakinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting 
interleukin-1β. It is currently indicated for use in those with rheumatologic 
disorders due to its anti-inflammatory properties, and was recently shown to be 
beneficial for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
However, the cost-effectiveness of canakinumab used to treat CVD is unknown.
METHODS: A Markov state transition model was developed and populated with a 
hypothetical sample of 1000 individuals profiled on the Canakinumab 
Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS); with a history of myocardial 
infarction (MI) and blood concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
(hsCRP) of >2 mg/L. With each annual cycle, individuals could have a recurrent 
non-fatal CVD event (MI or stroke), or die from a CVD event or die from other 
causes based on data from CANTOS. Individuals continued to cycle through the 
model for 20 years or until death. Cost and utility data was applied. Outcomes 
were discounted (5% annually).
RESULTS: Over a 20-year time horizon, canakinumab is predicted to prevent 40 
recurrent cardiovascular events and save 287 (discounted) years of life and 239 
(discounted) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in 1000 individuals. At an 
annual cost of AUD36,049 (USD25,590, GBP19,662) per person, canakinumab would 
not be considered cost-effective within the Australian healthcare system, with 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AUD1,221,170 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Canakinumab is an attractive treatment option to reduce recurrent 
CVD among patients with high hsCRP. It would be considered cost-effective in 
this treatment setting within the perspective of the Australian public 
healthcare system if its annual costs do not exceed AUD1500 (USD1065, GBP818) 
per person.

BACKGROUND: An improvement in life expectancy in patients suffering from adult 
congenital heart disease (ACHD) has corresponded with a rise in heart failure 
incidence within this group. An area that has not been addressed in ACHD heart 
failure guidelines has been the use of combined inhibition of angiotensin 
receptor-neprolysin pathways. This case series sought to demonstrate 
tolerability and 6-month outcome measures of sacubitril/valsartan use in ACHD 
patients with a severely impaired systemic ventricle.
METHODS: A prospective cohort analysis of ACHD patients between December 2016 
and September 2017 with severe systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction, New 
York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III symptoms and eligible for 
commencement on a sacubitril/valsartan regime was undertaken.
RESULTS: Five (5) consecutive patients were included in this cohort review, 80% 
male, mean age 41.8 (±19) years and mean systemic ventricular ejection fraction 
27% (±3.6%). Two (2) patients with pre-existing D-TGA and atrial baffle repair, 
one patient with Tetralogy of Fallot repair and pulmonary valve replacement 
(PVR), one patient with left atrial isomerism and partial atrioventricular (AV) 
canal defect repair and mitral valve replacement (MVR) and the last patient had 
biventricular repair for pulmonary atresia with MVR and PVR. Forty per cent 
(40%) of patients had a systemic right ventricle. All patients had NYHA 
functional class of ≥II, were on optimal tolerated doses ACE-I or ARB prior to 
sacubitril/valsartan combination. Six (6) months post commencement of 
sacubitril/valsartan patients experienced a mean improvement of one functional 
class.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that sacubitril/valsartan therapy is well 
tolerated in ACHD heart failure patients and is associated with improvement in 
functional class.

The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of chronic 
myeloid leukemia has significantly altered the prognosis of this disease, 
enabling close to normal life expectancy. Despite their undeniable benefits, the 
use of TKIs is associated with an increased risk of side effects on the 
cardiovascular system, particularly of atherothrombotic events. It is therefore 
necessary to understand and prevent the adverse effects of these drugs, in order 
to enable antileukemic therapy to continue and to minimize patients' toxic 
exposure. This multidisciplinary consensus document, developed through a 
collaboration between hematologists and cardiologists, aims to review the 
cardiovascular toxicity associated with various TKIs and to establish 
recommendations for the follow-up of these patients. Measures are also proposed 
for the assessment and reduction of cardiovascular risk in these patients and 
referral criteria, and relevant drug interactions are discussed.

The population of Moroccan elders is in full increase; their requirements for 
quality and quantity of services are becoming increasingly important. On the 
basis of this, reality and extension of many major innovative projects in 
Morocco (industrial expansion plan, renewable energy stations, the road 
infrastructure network, rural electrification, drinking water, accelerated 
urbanization, globalization...) gain importance. Reflection on the design of a 
typical residence for the elderly has become an ambitious idea possessing all 
the chances of its success; it is also worth noting that it is a citizen 
opportunity to be seized by all political decision-makers for the promotion of 
health and the improvement of the quality of life of a growing category of the 
population. The typical residence of the elderly remains not only a place of 
life but also an environment of therapeutic care and at different levels of 
autonomy and dependence of our elders.

Comparing the Role of Mechanical Forces in Vascular and Valvular Calcification 
Progression.

Gomel MA(1), Lee R(1), Grande-Allen KJ(1).

Author information:

Calcification is a prevalent disease in most fully developed countries and is 
predominantly observed in heart valves and nearby vasculature. Calcification of 
either tissue leads to deterioration and, ultimately, failure causing poor 
quality of life and decreased overall life expectancy in patients. In valves, 
calcification presents as Calcific Aortic Valve Disease (CAVD), in which the 
aortic valve becomes stenotic when calcific nodules form within the leaflets. 
The initiation and progression of these calcific nodules is strongly influenced 
by the varied mechanical forces on the valve. In turn, the addition of calcific 
nodules creates localized disturbances in the tissue biomechanics, which affects 
extracellular matrix (ECM) production and cellular activation. In vasculature, 
atherosclerosis is the most common occurrence of calcification. Atherosclerosis 
exhibits as calcific plaque formation that forms in juxtaposition to areas of 
low blood shear stresses. Research in these two manifestations of calcification 
remain separated, although many similarities persist. Both diseases show that 
the endothelial layer and its regulation of nitric oxide is crucial to 
calcification progression. Further, there are similarities between vascular 
smooth muscle cells and valvular interstitial cells in terms of their roles in 
ECM overproduction. This review summarizes valvular and vascular tissue in terms 
of their basic anatomy, their cellular and ECM components and mechanical forces. 
Calcification is then examined in both tissues in terms of disease prediction, 
progression, and treatment. Highlighting the similarities and differences 
between these areas will help target further research toward disease treatment.

BACKGROUND: Long acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI-APs) are considered a 
major advance in psychiatric treatment concerning treatment adherence and 
outcomes. Yet, both, doctors and patients remain sceptical.
AIM: To explain the rationale for using LAI-APs, review their effectiveness and 
explore barriers to use.
METHOD: Clinical overview of LAI-APs from the patient and doctor's perspective.
RESULTS: LAI-APs were developed to increase adherence to treatment, thereby 
improving treatment outcomes. LAI-APs may reduce the risk of relapse and 
hospitalisation. Yet, the evidence from the few meta-analyses available remains 
weak. Both patients and doctors may associate LAI-APs with stigma and coercion. 
Current means of improving adherence include more focus on the therapeutic 
relationship, better information, adverse effects minimisation and half-life 
extension of LAI-APs. Future means of improving adherence include novel 
administration techniques that abolish the need for injection.
CONCLUSIONS: For both, clinicians and drug developers, drug adherence remains a 
major target for improving treatment outcomes.

SUMMARY: Pushed by the growing availability of Electronic Health Records for 
data mining, the identification of relevant patterns of co-occurring diseases 
over a population of individuals-referred to as comorbidity analysis-has become 
a common practice due to its great impact on life expectancy, quality of life 
and healthcare costs. In this scenario, the availability of scalable, 
easy-to-use software frameworks tailored to support the study of comorbidities 
over large datasets of patients is essential. We introduce Comorbidity4j, an 
open-source Java tool to perform systematic analyses of comorbidities by 
generating interactive Web visualizations to explore and refine results. 
Comorbidity4j processes user-provided clinical data by identifying significant 
disease co-occurrences and computing a comprehensive set of comorbidity indices. 
Patients can be stratified by sex, age and user-defined criteria. Comorbidity4j 
supports the analysis of the temporal directionality and the sex ratio of 
diseases. The incremental upload and validation of clinical input data and the 
customization of comorbidity analyses are performed by an interactive Web 
interface. With a Web browser, the results of such analyses can be filtered with 
respect to comorbidity indexes and disease names and explored by means of heat 
maps and network charts of disease associations. Comorbidity4j is optimized to 
efficiently process large datasets of clinical data. Besides a software tool for 
local execution, we provide Comorbidity4j as a Web service to enable users to 
perform online comorbidity analyses.

Cost-effectiveness of Universal Hepatitis C Virus Screening of Pregnant Women in 
the United States.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus' (HCV) chronic prevalence among pregnant women in 
the United States doubled nationally from 2009-2014 (~0.7%), yet many cases 
remain undiagnosed. Screening pregnant women is not recommended by the Society 
of Maternal-Fetal Medicine or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
despite new American Association For the Study of Liver Diseases 
(AASLD)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommending 
screening for this group. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of HCV screening 
for pregnant women in the United States.
METHODS: An HCV natural history Markov model was used to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of universal HCV screening of pregnant women, followed by 
treatment after pregnancy, compared to background risk-based screening from a 
health-care payer perspective. We assumed a HCV chronic prevalence of 0.73% 
among pregnant women, based on national data. We assumed no Medicaid 
reimbursement restrictions by fibrosis stage at baseline, but explored differing 
restrictions in sensitivity analyses. We assessed costs (in US dollars) and 
health outcomes (in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) over a lifetime 
horizon, using new HCV drug costs of $25 000/treatment. We assessed mean 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) under a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50 000/QALY gained. We additionally evaluated the potential 
population impact.
RESULTS: Universal antenatal screening was cost-effective in all treatment 
eligibility scenarios (mean ICER <$3000/QALY gained). Screening remained 
cost-effective at a prevalence of 0.07%, which is the lowest estimated 
prevalence in the United States (in Hawaii). Screening the ~5.04 million 
pregnant women in 2018 could result in the detection and treatment of 33 000 
women, based on current fibrosis restrictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal screening for HCV among pregnant women in the United 
States is cost-effective and should be recommended nationally.

Systematic Review: Cost-effective Strategies of Optimizing Anti-tumor Necrosis 
and Immunomodulators in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

BACKGROUND: Medication costs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are now the 
principal driver of health care costs. Cost-effective strategies to optimize and 
rationalize treatment are therefore necessary.
METHODS: A systematic review until April 30, 2018, was performed to identify 
economic evaluations of strategies to optimize infliximab, adalimumab, and 
immunomodulators for the treatment of IBD in adults. A qualitative synthesis of 
the identified studies was performed.
RESULTS: Seventy articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria. 
Adalimumab seems cost-effective compared with infliximab as maintenance therapy 
for moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD). Infusion costs are a significant 
additional treatment cost with infliximab. However, other studies found 
biosimilar infliximab more cost-effective than alternative biologics in 
fistulizing and moderate-severe luminal CD-although the latter did not reach a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of <$50,000. In moderate-severe ulcerative colitis, 
infliximab seems more cost-effective than adalimumab. Multiple tailored 
approaches to treatment based on objective markers of disease activity or 
efficacy have been shown to be cost-effective in CD, including following 
secondary loss of response to anti-TNF therapy for postoperative recurrence and 
in escalating treatment. For immunomodulator treatment, both thiopurine 
methyltransferase (TPMT) testing before commencing thiopurines and thiopurine 
metabolite testing for dose optimization seem cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: In a win-win for patients and payers, several potential avenues to 
achieve cost-effectiveness-but also therapeutic optimization of anti-TNF 
therapies-were elucidated in this review with comparatively sparse data for 
immunomodulators. Optimizing immunomodulator and anti-tumor necrosis factor 
alpha therapy to achieve objective disease control seems to be cost-effective at 
conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds in a number of clinical settings.

PURPOSE: The risk of cardiotoxicity induced by adjuvant anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) is yet to be investigated in 
a large-scale randomized controlled trial with an adequate sample size of young 
and old women with breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: To compare the occurrence of major heart events (heart 
failure and coronary artery disease) in patients with breast cancer, 3489 women 
who underwent surgical resection of the breast tumor were retrospectively 
selected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The 
patients were categorized into the following groups based on their treatment 
modalities: group 1 (n = 1113), no treatment; group 2 (n = 646), adjuvant RT 
alone; group 3 (n = 705), adjuvant anthracycline-based CT alone; and group 4 
(n = 1025), combined adjuvant RT and anthracycline-based CT.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 50.35 years. Subsequent coronary artery 
disease and heart failure were identified in 244 (7.0%) and 206 (5.9%) patients, 
respectively. All three adjuvant therapies were significant independent 
prognostic factors of major heart events (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence 
interval]: 1.47 [1.24-1.73]; 1.48 [1.25-1.75], and 1.92 [1.65-2.23] in groups 2, 
3, and 4, respectively). In patients aged ≥50 years with breast cancer who 
underwent surgery, the log-rank p values of groups 2 and 3 after adjustment were 
0.537 and 0.001, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Adjuvant RT can increase cardiotoxicity in patients with breast 
cancer, particularly when used in combination with anthracycline-based CT. 
Therefore, it should be offered with optimal heart-sparing techniques, 
particularly in younger patients with good prognosis and long life expectancy.

In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a guidance to industry 
statement concerning evaluation of the cardiovascular (CV) safety of new 
antihyperglycaemic therapies for type 2 diabetes. Fifteen CV outcome trials 
assessing three novel classes of antihyperglycaemic therapies, DPP-4 inhibitors, 
GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors, were completed by the end of 2018 
and several others are ongoing. In addition, one comparative insulin trial also 
has been completed. None of these trials reported an increase in risk for major 
adverse CV events (MACE), and six agents have demonstrated CV benefits. This 
experience has led to the first FDA-approved indications for antihyperglycaemic 
medications to reduce the risk of CV death (empagliflozin) and to reduce the 
risk of MACE (liraglutide, canagliflozin), both indications specific to patients 
with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Because of the 
aggregate results from dedicated CV outcomes trials conducted in response to the 
FDA guidance statement, the contemporary paradigm for treatment of patients with 
type 2 diabetes has evolved substantially. However, the guidance has 
substantially increased the cost of developing new medications to address this 
important disease that afflicts hundreds of millions of adults worldwide, with 
reduction in quality of life as well as in life expectancy. The cost burden of 
drug development of medications proven effective that may directly impact cost 
to patients and to their insurers might be alleviated by modifications to the 
present guidance statement. These include areas of trial design, aspects of 
trial operation, expansion of composite outcomes to include broader component CV 
outcomes and continued evolution of analytic methodology. The guidance statement 
will benefit from consideration of a number of modifications to support 
continued innovation and, of course, the safety of marketed medications for type 
2 diabetes. However, the requirement to assess each new antihyperglycaemic 
medication in at least one large-scale standard randomized clinical outcomes 
trial should remain, so that clinicians can be reassured about the favourable 
efficacy/safety profiles of the medications they prescribe.

As life expectancy is growing, neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's 
disease, are increasing. This disease is characterised by the accumulation of 
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein, 
senile plaques composed of an extracellular deposit of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), 
and neuronal loss. This is accompanied by deficient mitochondrial function, 
increased oxidative stress, altered inflammatory response, and autophagy process 
impairment. The present study gathers scientific evidence that demonstrates that 
specific nutrients exert a direct effect on both Aβ production and Tau
