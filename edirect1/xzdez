among the same practitioner groups: 17 HBP, 15 SHP and 69 accredited GP 
(referred to throughout as GP; includes those with sexual health diploma). 
Analysis of survey results showed practices remained largely similar between 
surveys, with a few notable exceptions. Greater consistency in attitudes, 
knowledge and approaches was observed between the practitioner specialty groups, 
with only small differences between modes of practice. A trend towards earlier 
initiation of HIV treatment was also identified, with a higher proportion of 
practitioners than baseline reporting they were comfortable beginning therapy on 
the day of HIV diagnosis. The impact of the introduction of two-drug therapy in 
Australia was also explored. Although the majority of survey respondents (and 
SHP in particular) expressed greater preference for three-drug compared with 
two-drug regimens, interest in two-drug regimens appears to be growing and may 
influence future prescribing practices. Addressing mental health issues for 
PLWHIV was again highlighted as a major priority, with practitioners 
overwhelmingly reporting mental health management as among their most difficult 
clinical challenges. Reduction in stigma/discrimination and better access to 
substance dependency programmes were also identified as unmet needs for this 
patient cohort. Consistent with our baseline survey, it appears targeted 
interventions and supports appropriate to this population are still required to 
improve overall wellbeing for PLWHIV.

INTRODUCTION: Real-world evidence has demonstrated improved glycemic control and 
insulin management following introduction of smart insulin pens in a Swedish 
type 1 diabetes (T1D) population. To understand the implications for healthcare 
costs and expected health outcomes, this analysis evaluated the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of introducing smart insulin pens to standard-of-care T1D 
treatment (standard care) from a Swedish societal perspective.
METHODS: Clinical outcomes and healthcare costs (in 2018 Swedish krona, SEK) 
were projected over patients' lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model to 
estimate cost-effectiveness. Clinical data and baseline characteristics for the 
simulated cohort were informed by population data and a prospective, 
noninterventional study of a smart insulin pen in a Swedish T1D population. This 
analysis captured direct and indirect costs, mortality, and the impact of 
diabetes-related complications on quality of life.
RESULTS: Over patients' lifetimes, smart insulin pen use was associated with 
per-patient improvements in mean discounted life expectancy (+ 0.90 years) and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (+ 1.15 quality-adjusted life-years), in 
addition to mean cost savings (direct, SEK 124,270; indirect, SEK 373,725), 
versus standard care. A lower frequency and delayed onset of complications drove 
projected improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy and lower costs with 
smart insulin pens versus standard care. Overall, smart insulin pens were a 
dominant treatment option relative to standard care across all base-case and 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of smart insulin pens was projected to improve clinical 
outcomes at lower costs relative to standard care in a Swedish T1D population 
and represents a good use of healthcare resources in Sweden.

[Selective neurotization of the median nerve in young patients with 
CV-CVIIcomplicated spinal cord injury].

[Article in Russian; Abstract available in Russian from the publisher]

Russia.

BACKGROUND: Complicated spinal cord injury occurs in 1-5 cases per 100.000. In 
children, cervical trauma makes up 72% of all spinal trauma. Spinal cord injury 
complicates vertebral trauma in 25-50% of cases that usually results severe 
disability. Rehabilitation of these patients is usually ineffective or results a 
little improvement. Restoration of even minimal movements is essential in these 
patients. There are reports devoted to surgical rehabilitation of important hand 
functions after cervical spinal cord injury.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the restoration of key hand functions in patients with 
CV-CVII complicated spinal cord injury using selective neurotization of the 
median nerve.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three patients aged 17-19 years with complicated CV-CVII 
spinal cord injury and ASIA class A have been selected for surgery for 2 years. 
Mean period after rehabilitation was 11.3 months. Prior to surgery, all patients 
recovered flexion/extension in the elbow joints, forearm rotation, flexion and 
extension of hands. However, there were no active movements in distal phalanges 
of the fingers, and initial signs of flexor contracture were observed.
RESULTS: Surgical strategy included selective neurotization of the median nerve 
with a motor branch of musculocutaneous nerve. In one case, we used additional 
neurotization of posterior interosseous nerve. Two patients recovered 
cylindrical grip up to M4 and pinch grip up to M3 within 15 months. In the third 
patient, postoperative data were not assessed due to short-term follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Selective neurotization of anterior interosseous nerve may be 
considered as a stage or independent surgery for restoration of key hand 
functions. This approach improves the quality of life in patients with 
complicated spinal cord injury.

Publisher: Осложненная позвоночно-спинномозговая травма составляет 1—5 случаев 
на 100 тыс. населения. У детей на долю травм шейного отдела приходится 72% всех 
травм позвоночника. При этом от 25 до 50% травм позвоночника осложняются травмой 
спинного мозга, что в большинстве случаев приводит к глубокой инвалидизации. 
Реабилитация таких пациентов, как правило, неэффективна или приводит к 
незначительному улучшению. Восстановление даже минимальных движений для таких 
пациентов имеет принципиальное значение. В настоящее время появились публикации, 
посвященные хирургической реабилитации ключевых функций кисти при повреждениях 
шейного отдела спинного мозга.
ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Продемонстрировать возможность восстановления ключевых 
функций кисти у пациентов с осложненной позвоночно-спинномозгвой травмой на 
уровне CV—CVII на примере селективной невротизации ветвей срединного нерва.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: За 2 года для операции отобраны 3 пациента в возрасте от 17 
до 19 лет с осложненной позвоночно-спинномозговой травмой уровня CV—CVII. На 
момент травмы все пациенты соответствовали группе А по шкале ASIA. Средний срок 
обращения после реабилитации составил 11,3 месяца. К этому времени у всех 
пациентов восстановились полный объем сгибания и разгибания в локтевых суставах, 
ротация предплечий, сгибания и разгибания кистей рук, но отсутствовали активные 
движения в дистальных фалангах пальцев, были признаки формирующейся контрактуры 
в сгибателях.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Хирургическая тактика включала селективную невротизацию порции 
срединного нерва моторной веткой мышечно-кожного нерва. В одном из случаев 
применена дополнительная невротизация заднего межкостного нерва. При 
катамнестическом наблюдении через 15 мес у 2 пациентов отмечено восстановление 
функции цилиндрического хвата кисти до М4 и восстановление щипкового захвата до 
уровня М3. У третьего пациента катамнез не оценивался из-за малого срока после 
вмешательства.
ВЫВОДЫ: Селективная невротизация переднего межкостного нерва на уровне средней 
трети плеча может рассматриваться как этапная или самостоятельная операция в 
рамках восстановления ключевых функций кисти, что улучшает качество жизни 
пациентов с осложненной позвоночно-спинномозговой травмой.

STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical spine model. Comparison of stress in the implant and 
the adjacent cranial segment was done with conventional rigid versus dynamic 
stabilization system (DS) fixation.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to study stress at the proximal end of 
spinal fixation with a novel DS.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: High stress at the implant bone junction may cause 
proximal junctional failure (PJF) in adult deformity surgery.
METHODS: Five life-size spine models were instrumented with pedicle screws and a 
5.5-mm Titanium rod from T8-S1. The same models were subsequently instrumented 
with a similar rod and DS between T8-9 pedicle screws. The spine model was 
loaded with 25 Nm static load cranial to the proximal fixation in six 
directions. Strains were measured from the proximal screws. Disc pressure was 
measured from the proximal instrumented segment (T8-9) and cranial adjacent 
segment (T7-8).
RESULTS: Rigid fixation produced highest strain at T8, followed by T10 then T9. 
In contrast, DS fixation produced highest strain at T10, followed by T9 then T8. 
Strain at T8 was significantly less with DS fixation than rigid fixation 
(P = 0.019). The T10 screw strain was not significantly higher with DS 
stabilization compared to rigid fixation (P = 0.091). Rigid fixation allowed no 
load-sharing or pressure rise at T8-9 but an abrupt rise at T7-8. DS system 
permitted load-sharing and pressure rise in T8-9; the difference compared to 
rigid fixation was significant in flexion loading (P = 0.04) and similar trend 
but not significant in extension (P = 0.09). DS system produced a rise in the 
adjacent segment disc pressure (T7-8), which was smaller than rigid fixation but 
not significant.
CONCLUSION: Long spinal fixation using rigid rods produces maximum stress at the 
proximal end screw and increases adjacent disc pressure, possibly leading to 
PJF. Dynamic stabilization at the cranial end segment may prevent PJF by 
reducing these factors.Level of Evidence: N/A.

Bariatric surgery represents the most valid option to treat the chronic disease 
of morbid obesity and all its related comorbid conditions with the purpose to 
increase life expectancy. Despite multiple recommendations of the different 
scientific societies, bariatric surgery remains worldwide largely underused. 
Considering only a 16% rate of obesity disease, with the largest number of 
bariatric surgeries performed in Europe of 50k procedures a year, France should 
need more than 200 years to surgically approach all morbid obese patients. 
Similarly, in the United States, obesity is a chronic condition that affects 
more than 1 in 3 adults, with a mean number of 250k bariatric procedures a year, 
hence they would need 437 years to manage this population. Definitely, the 
bariatric surgery is very poorly used and there are several factors to explain 
it. Inadequate access to medical care and insufficient information provided by 
the general practitioner are frequently encountered in our practice. But the 
main limitation for the bariatric treatment remains the patients' "fear" of a 
surgical complication.

PURPOSE: Increasing evidence suggests that patients with a limited number of 
metastases benefit from SABR to all lesions. However, the optimal dose and 
fractionation remain unknown. This is particularly true for bone and lymph node 
metastases. Therefore, a prospective, single-center, dose-escalation trial was 
initiated.
METHODS: Dose-Escalation trial of STereotactic ablative body RadiOtherapY for 
non-spine bone and lymph node metastases (DESTROY) was an open-label phase 1 
trial evaluating SABR to nonspine bone and lymph node lesions in patients with 
up to 3 metastases. Patients with European Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status ≤1, an estimated life expectancy of at least 6 months, and 
histologically confirmed nonhematological malignancy were eligible. Three SABR 
fractionation regimens, ie, 5 fractions of 7.0 Gy versus 3 fractions of 10.0 Gy 
versus a single fraction of 20.0 Gy, were applied in 3 consecutive patient 
cohorts. The rate of ≥grade 3 toxicity, scored according to the Common Toxicity 
Criteria for Adverse Events v. 4.03, up to 6 months after SABR, was the primary 
endpoint. The trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03486431).
RESULTS: Between July 2017 and December 2018, 90 patients were enrolled. In 
total 101 metastases were treated. No ≥grade 3 toxicity was observed in any of 
the enrolled patients (95% CI 0.0%-12.3% for the first cohort with 28 analyzable 
patients; 95% CI 0.0%-11.6% for the second and third cohort with 30 analyzable 
patients each). Treatment-related grade 2 toxicities occurred in 4 out of 30 
versus 2 out of 30 versus 2 out of 30 patients for the 5, 3 and 1 fraction 
schedule, respectively. Actuarial local control rate at 12 months was 94.5%.
CONCLUSION: All 3 treatment schedules were feasible and effective with 
remarkably low toxicity rates and high local control rates. From a patient and 
resource point of view, the single-fraction schedule is undoubtedly most 
convenient.

In case of circumscribed recurrent glioblastoma (rec-GBM), a second surgery 
(Re-S) and reirradiation (Re-RT) are local strategies to consider. The aim is to 
provide an algorithm to use in the daily clinical practice. The first step is to 
consider the life expectancy in order to establish whether the patient should be 
a candidate for active treatment. In case of a relatively good life expectancy 
(>3 months) and a confirmed circumscribed disease(i.e. without multiple lesions 
that are in different lobes/hemispheres), the next step is the assessment of the 
prognostic factors for local treatments. Based on the existing prognostic score 
systems, patients who should be excluded from local treatments may be 
identified; based on the validated prognostic factors, one or the other local 
treatment may be preferred. The last point is the estimation of expected 
toxicity, considering patient-related, tumor-related and treatment-related 
factors impacting on side effects. Lastly, patients with very good prognostic 
factors may be considered for receiving a combined treatment.

Introduction: Many patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not achieve 
remission with their first antidepressant (AD), resulting in a high burden due 
to treatment failure. Vortioxetine is a valid treatment option for patients with 
MDD only partially responding to their first AD. Characterization of 
vortioxetine's potential benefits versus other approved treatments is important. 
Areas covered: The cost-effectiveness of vortioxetine, including cognitive 
outcomes, was modeled in comparison with levomilnacipran and vilazodone for 
patients switched to these medications after inadequate responses to a first AD. 
Expert opinion: Vortioxetine was associated with incremental quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gains versus levomilnacipran (0.008) or vilazodone (0.009). 
Vortioxetine was dominant versus levomilnacipran and cost-effective versus 
vilazodone (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER],33,829 USD/QALY). In 
sensitivity analyses using residual cognitive dysfunction rates (vortioxetine, 
49%; levomilnacipran, 58%, and vilazodone, 64%), incremental QALY gains for 
vortioxetine versus levomilnacipran (0.0085) or vilazodone (0.0109) were found. 
Vortioxetine remained dominant versus levomilnacipran and cost-effective versus 
vilazodone (ICER, 27,633 USD/QALY). ICER reduction was found with cognition 
outcomes inclusion. This model provides additional support for considering 
vortioxetine for patients requiring a switch of MDD treatments, although its 
conclusions are limited by the data available for inclusion. Additional research 
and real-world trials are needed to confirm the findings.

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with a high risk of 
developing chronic diseases and decreased life expectancy, but no ACE epigenetic 
biomarkers have been identified until now. The latter may result from the 
interaction of multiple factors such as age, sex, degree of adversity, and lack 
of transcriptional effects of DNA methylation changes. We hypothesize that DNA 
methylation changes are related to childhood adversity levels and current age, 
and these markers evolve as aging proceeds. Two Gene Expression Omnibus 
datasets, regarding ACE, were selected (GSE72680 and GSE70603), considering raw- 
and meta-data availability, including validated ACE index (Childhood Trauma 
Questionnaire (CTQ) score). For DNA methylation, analyzed probes were restricted 
to those laying within promoters and first exons, and samples were grouped by 
CTQ scores terciles, to compare highly (ACE) with non-abused (control) cases. 
Comparison of control and ACE methylome profile did not retrieve differentially 
methylated CpG sites (DMCs) after correcting by false discovery rate < 0.05, and 
this was also observed when samples were separated by sex. In contrast, grouping 
by decade age ranges (i.e., the 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s) showed a progressive 
increase in the number of DMCs and the intensity of changes, mainly related with 
hypomethylation. Comparison with transcriptome data for ACE subjects in the 40s, 
and 50s showed a similar age-dependent effect. This study provides evidence that 
epigenetic markers of ACE are age-dependent, but not defined in the long term. 
These differences among early, middle, and late adulthood epigenomic profiles 
suggest a window for interventions aimed to prevent the detrimental effects of 
ACE.

Older people (those aged 65 years or more) with diabetes comprise a heterogenous 
group of patients with special needs and features; this is particularly true for 
those aged 75 years or more. It is important that individualized glycemic 
targets be adopted in this population, after considering life expectancy, 
presence of diabetic complications and other comorbidities. In general, less 
rigorous targets and avoidance of overtreatment seems to be a reasonable 
strategy in daily clinical settings. There is a paucity of data regarding the 
efficacy and safety of various hypoglycemic agents, especially for those aged 
over 75. The evidence suggests that sulfonylureas and insulin regimens should be 
used with caution due to a high risk of hypoglycemia. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors are a good choice for the management of diabetes in older age groups, 
although a warning against the use of specific agents in people with heart 
failure is valid. There are insufficient data to decide whether the cardiorenal 
protective properties of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors outweigh the 
risks associated with these drugs. The use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
agonists by older patients is supported not only by their good safety and 
efficacy profiles, but also by their potential to improve glucose-independent 
outcomes, through their pleiotropic actions. The aim of this narrative review is 
to summarize the evidence on glycemic targets and optimal therapeutic approaches 
for older patients with type 2 diabetes and discuss the risk-benefit balance of 
various therapeutic approaches in this group.

OBJECTIVE: To prevent osteoporotic fractures in nursing home residents a 
combination of bisphosphonates, calcium and vitamin D is recommended. This study 
assessed the prevalence of pharmacological osteoporosis prevention in nursing 
home residents from eight countries, and assessed its association with patient 
characteristics.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses of the SHELTER study data. We assessed the 
overall prevalence of osteoporosis medication (OM) use (vitamin D, calcium and 
bisphosphonates) in residents stratified for falls and fractures over last 30 
days, health instability with high mortality risk, cognitive impairment, and 
dependence in walking.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents in the Czech Republic, England, 
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and Israel.
RESULTS: Of 3832 eligible residents, vitamin D, calcium and bisphosphonates were 
used by 16.2%, 10.4%, and 4.5% respectively. All 3 classes of OM together were 
used by 1.5% of all residents. Of residents with a recent fracture, 9.5% used a 
bisphosphonate (2.7% all 3 OMs). In patients with recent falls, 20.8% used 
vitamin D and 15.3% calcium. In residents with severe cognitive impairment, 
15.5% used vitamin D and 9.3% used calcium. Of the bisphosphonate users, 33.7% 
also used both vitamin D and calcium, 25.8% used only calcium in addition and 
17.4% only vitamin D in addition. The use of any OM varied widely across 
countries, from 66.8% in Finland to 3.0% in Israel.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found substantial pharmacological 
under-treatment of prevention of osteoporosis in residents with recent falls, 
fractures and dependence in walking. Only two-thirds of bisphosphonate users 
also took a vitamin D-calcium combination, despite guideline recommendations. On 
the other hand, possible over-treatment was found in residents with high 
mortality risk in whom preventive pharmacotherapy might not have still been 
appropriate. The prevalence of pharmacological prevention of osteoporosis 
differed substantially between countries. Efforts are needed to improve 
pharmacotherapy in residents.

Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) comprises a globally important 
waste stream due to the scarcity and value of the materials that it contains; 
annual generation of WEEE is increasing by 3-5% per annum. The effective 
management of WEEE will contribute critically to progress towards (1) 
realisation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, (2) a circular 
economy, and (3) resource efficiency. This comprehensive review paper provides a 
critical and contemporary examination of the current global situation of WEEE 
management and discusses opportunities for enhancement. Trends in WEEE 
generation, WEEE-related policies and legislation are exemplified in detail. 
Four typical future WEEE management scenarios are identified, classified and 
outlined. The European Community is at the forefront of WEEE management, largely 
due to the WEEE Directive (Directive 2012/19/EU) which sets high collection and 
recycling targets for Member States. WEEE generation rates are increasing in 
Africa though collection and recycling rates are low. WEEE-related legislation 
coverage is increasing in Asia (notably China and India) and in Latin America. 
This review highlights emerging concerns, including: stockpiling of WEEE 
devices; reuse standards; device obsolescence; the Internet of Things, the 
potential for collecting space e-debris, and emerging trends in electrical and 
electronic consumer goods. Key areas of concern in regard to WEEE management are 
identified: the partial provision of formal systems for WEEE collection and 
treatment at global scale; further escalation of global WEEE generation 
(increased ownership, and acceleration of obsolescence and redundancy); and 
absence of regulation and its enforcement. Measures to improve WEEE management 
at global scale are recommended: incorporation of circular economy principles in 
EEE design and production, and WEEE management, including urban mining; 
extension of WEEE legislation and regulation, and improved enforcement thereof; 
harmonisation of key terms and definitions to permit consistency and meaning in 
WEEE management; and improvements to regulation and recognition of the informal 
WEEE management sector.

group-labelling and health-gain type? A choice-experiment.

Public health policy has two primary aims: promoting population health and 
reducing health inequalities. When these aims conflict, policy-makers must 
determine the relative importance to place on each in decision-making. We 
conducted a computer-based, face-to-face, choice-experiment to explore how the 
UK-public think government should act in these situations; and to explore how 
"inequality-aversion" may differ depending on the groups between which a health 
inequality exists and type of health an intervention provides. We tested three 
hypotheses: (1) the UK-public are more averse to inequalities in health between 
socioeconomic groups than they are to inequalities in health between neutrally 
labelled groups; (2) this difference is, at least in part, driven by the role 
non-health information plays in determining aversion to inequalities in health 
between socioeconomic groups; and (3) the UK-public are more willing to 
prioritise groups with lower lifetime health over groups with higher lifetime 
health if an intervention improves life-expectancy than if it improves 
quality-of-life. Eighty people participated in Sheffield and Hull in May/June 
2019. Each participant completed three Person-Trade-Off exercises between 
interventions that would improve population health and reduce health 
inequalities, or improve population health by a larger amount but increase 
health inequalities. Participants were randomised to exercises involving 
scenarios with socioeconomic groups or neutrally-labelled groups, and each 
answered questions about three health-benefit types: increased life-expectancy; 
pain-relief; and mobility-improvement. Following the exercises, participants 
provided rationales for their selections. Respondents were (1) more averse to 
inequalities in health between socioeconomic groups than neutrally labelled 
groups. Participant rationales suggest (2) this divergence is partly motivated 
by factors other than health: for example, financial inequality between 
socioeconomic groups. The sample was also (3) more willing to prioritise 
neutrally labelled groups with lower lifetime health if an intervention improves 
life-expectancy rather than if it improves quality-of-life.

CONTEXT: The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends engaging 
community health workers to increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer 
screenings on the basis of strong evidence of effectiveness. This systematic 
review examines the economic evidence of these interventions.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search was performed with a search 
period through April 2019 to identify relevant economic evaluation studies. All 
monetary values were adjusted to 2018 U.S. dollars, and the analysis was 
completed in 2019.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 19 studies were included in the final analysis 
with 3 on breast cancer, 5 on cervical cancer, 9 on colorectal cancer, and 2 
that combined costs for breast and cervical cancers and for breast, cervical, 
and colorectal cancers. For cervical cancer screening, 2 U.S. studies reported 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year saved of $762 and $34,405. For 
colorectal cancer screening, 2 U.S. studies reported both a negative incremental 
cost and an increase in quality-adjusted life years saved with colonoscopy 
screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Engaging community health workers to increase cervical and 
colorectal cancer screenings is cost effective on the basis of estimated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios that were less than the conservative 
$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year threshold. In addition, quality-adjusted 
life years saved from colorectal screening with colonoscopy were associated with 
net healthcare cost savings.

PURPOSE: The phase 2 randomized study SABR-COMET demonstrated that in patients 
with controlled primary tumors and 1 to 5 oligometastatic lesions, SABR was 
associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with standard 
of care (SoC), but with higher costs and treatment-related toxicities. The aim 
of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SABR versus SoC in this 
setting.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov model was constructed to perform a cost-utility 
analysis from the Canadian health care system perspective. Utility values and 
transition probabilities were derived from individual-level data from the 
SABR-COMET trial. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed. Costs were expressed in 2018 CAD. A separate analysis based on US 
payer's perspective was performed. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) was used.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario, SABR was cost-effective at an ICER of 
$37,157 per QALY gained. This finding was most sensitive to the number of 
metastatic lesions treated with SABR (ICER: $28,066 per QALY for 2, increasing 
to $64,429 per QALY for 5), difference in chemotherapy use (ICER: 
$27,173-$53,738 per QALY), and PFS hazard ratio (HR) between strategies (ICER: 
$31,548-$53,273 per QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that SABR 
was cost-effective in 97% of all iterations. Two-way sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between the number of lesions and the PFS 
HR. To maintain cost-effectiveness for each additional metastasis, the HR must 
decrease by approximately 0.047. The US cost analysis yielded similar results, 
with an ICER of $54,564 (2018 USD per QALY) for SABR.
CONCLUSIONS: SABR is cost-effective for patients with 1 to 5 oligometastatic 
lesions compared with SoC.

AIMS: Macrophage is known to readily engulf any particulate material they 
encounter, including invading microbes and nano- or micro-particles. While 
recent studies show that some microparticles (MP) are immunogenic even without 
drug-cargo, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is yet unclear. 
Phagocytosis induces NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX-2) mediated ROS generation that is 
reported to regulate antibacterial autophagy. We therefore, investigated the 
role of NOX-2 derived ROS in phagosomal maturation and autophagy induction in 
response to phagocytic uptake of two kinds of polymeric biodegradable and 
biocompatible microparticles: yeast-derived β-glucan particles (YDGP) and 
poly-(D, L-Lactic Acid) microparticles (PMP).
MAIN METHODS: J774A.1 macrophage wereas exposed to polymeric particles and the 
immune responses: ROS, phagosomal maturation and autophagy induction, were 
examined by assays including NBT, DCFH-DA, NADPH-Oxidase activity, Lysotracker 
and Acridine Orange. Further, the LC3 and NOX-2 expression were validated by 
RT-PCR, immunofluorescence assay and Western blotting. Antimicrobial activity of 
both MP was examined by CFU counting after administration to Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis and Salmonella typhimurium infected macrophage.
KEY FINDINGS: YDGP induces phagosomal maturation and acidic vesicle accumulation 
at 30 min and 24 h post-exposure, much more proficiently than that by PMP. YDGP 
exposure also induced NOX-2 dependent expression of light chain 3 (LC3-II), 
further confirmed as autophagy activation via autophagic flux assay with 
autophagolysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Additionally, YDGP displayed 
superior anti-microbial activity than that by PMP.
SIGNIFICANCE: The induction of NOX-2-dependent autophagy and antimicrobial 
activity exhibited by particulate glucans has significant implications in 
harnessing these drug delivery vehicles as potential 'value-added' 
autophagy-mediated therapeutics in future.

OBJECTIVES: We explored the male-female health-survival paradox in the context 
of health expectancy (HE) at age 65 and thereafter, using three different 
morbidity measures and different severity cut-offs with and without adjustments 
for the share of nursing home residents.
METHODS: HE at ages 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 was estimated with the Sullivan 
method, linking morbidity prevalence from the KORA (Cooperative Health Research 
in the Region of Augsburg)-Age study to 2016 Bavarian mortality data. Morbidity 
measures comprised deficit accumulation (Frailty Index, FI, cut-offs 0.08 and 
0.25), disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, HAQ-DI, 
cut-off >0) and participation (Global Activity Limitation Indicator, GALI, 
"limited" vs "not limited").
RESULTS: Morbidity data were available for 4083 participants (52.7% female). HE 
was lower in women than in men at all ages. Differences in morbidity prevalence, 
absolute HE, and health proportions of life expectancy (relative HE) increased 
with age for FI ≥ 0.25 and GALI, but not for HAQ-DI > 0 and FI > 0.08. 
Accounting for the share of nursing home residents resulted in a slight 
reduction of HE estimates but had no impact on estimated sex differences.
CONCLUSIONS: In HE at age 65 and thereafter, women's health disadvantage was 
larger than their life expectancy advantage over men.

    J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2021 Mar;60(3):346-354.

The National Quality Strategy to transform the US health care system is 
predicated upon Donald Berwick et al.'s "Triple Aim" envisioning the 
simultaneous pursuit of improved care, better population health, and reduced 
costs.1 More recently, emphasis has been placed on improving the value of health 
care as defined by "achieving the best patient health outcomes (quality + 
experience) at the lowest cost."2 US health care expenditures are projected to 
grow at an average annual rate of 5.4% during this decade, reaching 19.7% of the 
gross domestic product or an estimated 6.1 billion dollars by 2028.3 Compared 
with 36 high-income countries, including Canada, the US spends nearly twice as 
much on health care yet has the lowest life expectancy and highest suicide 
rate.4 However, solely targeting reduction in mental health care costs is not a 
solution, because the mental and general health care systems are inextricably 
linked5 and for children span multiple care sectors (eg, schools, child welfare, 
juvenile justice). In this issue of the Journal, Ansari et al.6 validates the 
complexity of physically ill children with a comorbid psychiatric disorder among 
more than 50,000 admissions to an acute-care pediatric specialty hospital within 
Canada's publicly funded health care system. Almost one out of 10 admissions for 
a physical illness had a documented comorbid psychiatric disorder, which is 
consistent with US pediatric hospital discharges.7 Children who were older, more 
clinically complex, and with prior hospitalizations were more likely to be among 
inpatient admissions with a comorbid psychiatric disorder. With outstanding 
methodologic rigor, the data suggest that pediatric inpatient admissions with 
comorbid psychiatric disorders had a nearly 10% longer length of stay and higher 
costs per admission compared with inpatient admissions without a comorbid 
psychiatric disorder---a difference in total cumulative costs of more than 
CAN$11.3 million (equivalent of about US$8.4 million).

Road safety varies significantly across the regions in Europe. To understand the 
factors behind this differentiation and the effects they have, data covering 263 
NUTS-2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) regions across Europe 
(European Union and Norway) have been analysed. The assessment was made using 
Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). As a dependent variable the Road 
Fatality Rate (RFR - number of fatalities in a given year per one million 
population of the region) was used. The GWR was developed from 2014 data and 
took account of variables that characterise economic, infrastructural and social 
development. The model was validated using 2016-2018 data. The following factors 
were found to be statistically significant: gross domestic product per person 
(GDPPC), number of passenger cars per inhabitant (MRPC), share of passenger 
vehicles (PPC), life expectancy at birth (LIFE), as well as variables related to 
the border of the regions, innerborder (IB) and outerborder (OB). Results 
suggest that the GWR has an advantage over the global linear model which does 
not address regional proximity. The model allows for identification of the
