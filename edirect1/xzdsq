Bariatric surgery is a highly effective treatment option for morbid obesity. 
Short- and long-term effects of bariatric surgery are not limited to weight loss 
but include resolution of type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, improvement of 
cardiovascular health, and overall mortality. The long life expectancy of 
patients undergoing bariatric procedures means many of these patients will 
succumb to other diseases. Altered GI anatomy after bariatric procedures could 
prove an obstacle in treatment. We present our management of one such 
occurrence. The patient, who had 5 years previously undergone a Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass, presented after a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage which resulted 
in spastic tetraplegia. He was unable to consume food and was at risk of 
malnutrition. A decision was made to laparoscopically create a percutaneous 
gastrostomy (PEG) into the excluded stomach, allowing for the use of standard 
feeding formula and avoiding the need for parenteral nutrition and prolonged 
hospitalization due to metabolic complications. The growing number of patients 
following bariatric procedures directs the need for novelty treatment options 
suited to the altered anatomy and physiology of the patient post-bariatric 
surgery. Prompt evaluation of long-term complications after cardiovascular 
events in patients operated with bariatric surgical technics reduced nutritional 
complications, rated hospital stay, and improved quality of life. In those 
patients who, due to the localization of the brain defect, are expected to be 
unable to feed independently due to the consequences of the latter and have 
either long-term or lifelong feeding through feeding tubes, it is necessary to 
establish an enteral feeding pathway through which the patient can receive a 
standard nutritional formula. This prevents the patient from developing 
metabolic complications and related complications. At the same time, we enable 
inpatient accommodation without the risk of dietary complications associated 
with bariatric surgery.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by hypoxic episodes 
due to collapse of the airway during sleep and is frequently associated with 
obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). 
There is currently no pharmacological agent approved for the treatment of OSA. 
Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have the potential to both 
increase life expectancy and quality of life of these patients making them 
promising agents for this role. There are relatively few studies investigating 
this possible beneficial relationship between these drugs and OSA.
METHOD: We aimed to increase awareness on the potential benefits of SGLT2 
inhibitors in OSA patients by describing the current evidence on the 
effectiveness of these inhibitors in both overall and cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality. We performed a literature search for articles reporting on the 
use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with OSA and T2DM.
RESULTS: We identified 4 manuscripts studying the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in 475 
OSA patients with T2DM. Among them, 332 patients were administered SGLT2 
inhibitors, and 143 patients were in a control group. SGLT2 inhibitors have many 
potential positive impacts on OSA patients by targeting various mechanisms 
involved in OSA pathogenesis.
CONCLUSION: SGLT2 inhibitors are prime pharmacological candidates for the 
treatment of OSA, and additional studies are needed to better explore mechanisms 
and outcomes unique to this population. Additionally, patients with OSA often 
have multiple comorbidities that are clinical indications for SGLT2 inhibitor 
therapy. Physicians should recognize and encourage the use of these agents in 
such patients.

BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence about lifetime burden of child 
malnutrition. This study aimed to estimate the lifetime impact of being 
underweight or overweight/obese during childhood in Vietnam.
METHODS: We developed a life table model in combination with a Markov model for 
Vietnamese children aged 5-19 years and simulated until they reached 75 years of 
age or died using published data. The starting year was 2019 and the model 
estimated number of deaths, years of life lived and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) with an annual discount rate of 3%. We performed scenario, one-way, and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of uncertainties in 
input parameters.
RESULTS: The model estimated 9.68 million deaths (6.44 million men and 3.24 
million women), 622 million years of life lived (317 million men and 305 million 
women), and 601 million QALYs (308 million men and 293 million women). Scenario 
analyses showed that the reduction in either underweight or overweight/obesity 
alone, and reduction in both underweight and overweight/obesity resulted in 
fewer deaths, more years of life lived and more QALYs gained. In the scenario 
where everyone was a healthy weight, the model estimated 577,267 fewer deaths 
(6.0% less), 2 million more years of life lived (0.3% more), and 3 million QALYs 
gained (0.6% more) over base-case results which represents current situation in 
Vietnam.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that addressing underweight and 
overweight/obesity will contribute to reducing deaths and increasing years of 
life lived and QALYs. Policies and interventions in alignment with Sustainable 
Development Goals to address underweight and overweight/obesity are necessary to 
achieve health for all.

BACKGROUND: The shortage of healthcare workers is becoming a serious global 
problem. The underlying reasons may be specific to the healthcare system in each 
country. Over the past decade, medicine has become an increasingly unpopular 
profession in China due to the heavy workload, long-term training, and inherent 
risks. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has placed the life-saving roles of 
healthcare professionals under the spotlight. This public health crisis may have 
a profound impact on career choices in Chinese population.
METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire-based online survey among 21,085 senior 
high school students and 21,009 parents from 24 provinces (or municipalities) of 
China. We investigated the change of interest in medical study due to the 
outbreak of COVID-19 and the potential motivational factors based on the 
expectancy-value theory framework. Pearson correlation analysis was used to 
assess the correlation of static or dynamic interest in medical career pursuit 
with the reported number of COVID-19 cases. Logistic regression model was 
adopted to analyze the main factors associated with students' choices.
RESULTS: We observed an increased preference for medical study post the outbreak 
of COVID-19 in both students (17.5 to 29.6%) and parents (37.1 to 47.3%). 
Attainment value was found to be the main reason for the choice among students, 
with the contribution to society rated as the top motivation. On the other hand, 
the predominant demotivation in high school students was lack of interest, 
followed by concerns regarding violence against doctors, heavy workload, 
long-term training and heavy responsibility as a doctor. Additionally, students 
who were female, in the resit of final year, had highly educated parents and 
outside of Hubei province were significantly associated with a keen interest in 
pursuing medical study.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first multi-center cross-sectional study exploring the 
positive change and motivations of students' preferences in medical study due to 
the outbreak of COVID-19. Our results may help medical educators, researchers 
and policymakers to restructure medical education to make it more appealing to 
high school students, particularly, to develop a more supportive social and 
working environment for medical professionals to maintain the observed enhanced 
enthusiasm.

Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a severe hereditary disease characterized by 
defective epithelial adhesion causing mucocutaneous fragility. The major types 
are EB simplex (EBS), junctional EB (JEB), dystrophic EB (DEB) and more than 35 
EB subtypes. Another very rare type of EB is Kindler EB (KEB). Clinically, it is 
a very heterogeneous disease which ranges from localized to extensive skin 
lesions with frequent multisystem extra cutaneous involvement. The role of a 
pediatrician-dermatologist cooperation within a multidisciplinary team is 
fundamental for both the diagnosis and management contributing to these 
patients' better life expectancy. Aim of this study is to describe clinical and 
laboratory characteristics of the main EB subtypes focusing on nutritional and 
gastrointestinal aspects, providing information to aid the paediatric management 
of children with EB. This retrospective study reviewed the cases of 160 
pediatric EB patients (76 male and 84 female): 31 patients affected by EBS (mean 
age ± SD: 4.37 ± 7.14), 21 patients affected by JEB (mean age ± SD: 9.26± 17.30) 
and 108 with DEB (mean age ± SD: 11.61 ± 13.48). All patients were admitted at 
the Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital in Rome, between June 2005 to June 2020. 
The reduced gastrointestinal absorption, chronic losses, esophageal stenosis and 
chronic inflammatory state, represent the basis of nutritional problems of EB 
patients. In particular, anemia represents one of the most important 
complications of DEB patients which could require transfusion-dependent 
patterns. Malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies and anemia have been related to 
growth delay in EB patients. A specific diet with a balance of all 
macronutrients is required and improving caloric intake with sugar limitations 
is fundamental to prevent dental caries and tooth decay typical of EB patients. 
While sepsis proved to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in younger 
patients, squamous cell carcinoma was mostly observed in older patients, 
especially those affected by DEB. Patients with EB require regular monitoring 
for complications and sequelae with a frequency of evaluations which varies 
based on age and EB subtypes. Cooperation among medical teams involving 
paediatricians, dermatologists, specialist clinicians including nutritionists 
such as families and patient's association is fundamental to approach the 
disease and improve the quality of life of these patients.

INTRODUCTION: Disaster management (DM) is becoming increasingly complex because 
of technological advancement and the multi-organization and international 
contexts. Effective interoperability and adequate collaboration in DM have the 
potential to spare the human life and to control the economic burden. For those 
reasons, it's becoming important to find a way for systems and organizations 
that exploit, at the same time, the technological interoperability and team's 
interoperability.This study aims to provide an overview of the 
multi-organizational problems and solutions reflecting on achieving 
interoperability in multi-organizational DM.
METHODS: The article is structured as a scoping review based on the Joanna 
Briggs Institute's (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews. The Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was used to report the results. The selected 
papers were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) 
checklists to screen their methodological quality.The scoping review was 
conducted systematically searching the databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web 
of Science. The search algorithm was developed using the three key concepts 
"interoperability; multi-organizational; disaster medicine" translated into 
different possible search and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Studies of 
all research design types were considered.
DISCUSSION: The included literature is reporting experiences on interoperability 
and how it has been applied to health care systems and organizations interacting 
during a disaster event. Twelve articles were included. Specific problems and 
solutions were identified regarding the technological and personnel 
interoperability, such as ineffective integration, technical problems, lack of 
an interoperability language, and data filtering network. The suggested approach 
might involve a focus on both the technological as well the human and personnel 
interoperability with the aim to create a culture of interoperability through 
compatible technological solutions and joint trainings.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified two main approaches during disasters: 
technology versus personnel interoperability. The suggested approach is to 
develop a hybrid culture of interoperability through compatible technological 
solutions combined to joint and multi-disciplinary trainings to achieve the 
development of a common language.Further research will need a solution-focused 
approach on the culture and language of interoperability as thematic gathering 
training, socio-technical networks, and policies/procedural guidelines.

INTRODUCTION: Adults with intellectual disability (ID) have lower physical 
fitness levels than their peers without disabilities, representing a risk to 
their health since physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are directly 
related to better health and quality of life. Therefore, it is essential to 
determine the effects that exercise can have on them, as adults with ID present 
high comorbidities and lower life expectancy, altogether with lower rates of 
physical activity. The current overview of systematic reviews aims to provide an 
outline of the exercise benefits in health-related and skill-related fitness in 
adults with ID.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Research will be conducted in PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, 
PEDro, SPORTDiscus and CINAHL. The search terms will be categorised through 
population (eg, adult, ID); intervention (eg, exercise, physical activity) and 
outcomes (eg, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, muscular strength, 
muscular endurance, flexibility, balance, power, speed, agility, coordination, 
mobility and reaction time). Each database will be searched from their earliest 
available record up to 30 September 2021.Inclusion criteria will be: systematic 
reviews including at least one RCT that compare exercise interventions with a 
control group or another type of intervention; measure of fitness using 
objectives methods; inclusion of adults with ID (≥18 years old), and published 
in any language, with at least their abstract in English, Spanish, French and/or 
Portuguese.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: To our knowledge, our overview will be the first of 
its kind to address the topic in people with ID. The results could be used to 
determine which fitness components can be improved by exercise and to provide a 
valuable tool to develop comprehensive exercise programmes specific to people 
with ID. Ethical approval is not required. The knowledge generated will be 
disseminated electronically and in print and presented at conferences.

Ranunculus (Ranunculus asiaticus L.) is a popular ornamental plant mainly 
cultivated for cut flowers and flowering potted plants. In January 2021, a leaf 
sample of R. asiaticus that showed virus-like symptoms including mosaic, 
yellowing and malformation on leaves was collected from a greenhouse in 
Jangheung, South Korea for disease diagnosis (Fig. S1). Disease incidence was 
greater than 30% in the greenhouse (~1,000 m2). Transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) of symptomatic leaves identified potyvirus-like filamentous virus 
particles of about 800 nm. To confirm the TEM results, a symptomatic leaf sample 
was further analyzed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
using species-specific detection primers for six potyviruses that infect R. 
asiaticus (Sacco et al., 2018). The sample was positive only for ranunculus mild 
mosaic virus (RanMMV). Additional analysis of nine symptomatic R. asiaticus 
plants from the infected greenhouse found that all samples were positive for 
RanMMV. To exclude the presence of the other viruses, next generation sequencing 
(NGS) was carried out. Total RNA was extracted from symptomatic leaves using the 
RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and a transcriptome library was 
generated using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep kit (Illumina, San 
Diego, CA) acccording to the recommended protocol. NGS was performed using an 
Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system (Macrogen Inc., Korea). A total of 75.58 million 
reads were obtained, and the reads were de novo assembled to contigs using 
Trinity software (Grabherr et al., 2011). BLASTn and BLASTx analysis of the 
contigs against the NCBI viral reference database identified the assembled large 
contig of 9,539 nt (5,321 mapped reads, mean read coverage of 84.2 times) as 
RanMMV. This sequence shared 98% nt identity (99% coverage) with the RanMMV NL 
isolate (acc. no. LC604020) isolated from an anemone plant (A. blanda cv. 
Charmer) from Netherlands. To obtain the complete genome sequence, the termini 
sequences were determined by 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) 
methods as reported recently (Imamura et al., 2021). The assembled full-length 
genome sequence of RanMMV-JH is 9,574 nt in length, excluding the poly(A) tail, 
and encoding a polyprotein of 3,074aa. The sequence was deposited in GenBank 
under the accession no. OL742438. RanMMV is transmitted by aphids in a 
nonpersistent manner and has very narrow host range. RanMMV, one of causative 
agents of ranunculus mosaic disease, has been problematic in ranunculus 
production area of Japan (Hayahi et al., 2018; Kamikawa et al., 2022). Recently, 
some perennial weeds from the Ranunculaceae family (e.g. R. japonicus, R. 
silerifolius and R. tachiroei) are known to may act as a virus reservoir 
(Kamikawa et al., 2022). As R. asiaticus is cultivated by vegetative 
propagation, there is need to develop certification system for producing 
virus-free R. asiaticus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of RanMMV 
infection in R. asiaticus in Korea.

BACKGROUND: real-world observations on the long-term benefits of Tai Chi (TC) 
exercise, in terms of physical and cognitive functioning, frailty, quality of 
life (QOL) and mortality are lacking.
METHODS: prospective cohort study participants were community-dwelling adults 
aged 55+, including 5,407 non-frequent TC participants (<1x/week) and 572 
frequent TC participants (≥1x/week). Outcome measures at baseline and 3-5 years 
follow-up included physical performance (Knee Extension Strength, POMA Balance 
and Gait, Timed-up-and-go, Gait Speed) and neurocognitive performance (attention 
and working memory, visual-motor tracking and mental flexibility, verbal 
learning and memory, visual memory, spatial and constructional ability), Frailty 
Index ≥0.10, impaired QOL (SF12 physical and mental component) and all-cause 
mortality from mean 13 years follow-up. Effect estimates were adjusted for 
socio-demographics, other physical activities, nutritional risk and presence of 
cardiometabolic diseases.
RESULTS: frequent TC participation was associated with 0.7-fold lower prevalence 
of impaired physical QOL [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.57-0.91], decreased 
0.4-fold odds of incident prefrailty/frailty among robust participants at 
baseline and 0.7-fold odds of impaired mental QOL at follow-up among 
participants with normal mental QOL at baseline. Lower odds of mortality risk 
(HR = 0.89, 95%CI = 0.72-1.09) were not significant after controlling for 
socioeconomic, behavioural and health factors. Composite indexes of physical 
functional and neurocognitive performance were maintained at high level or 
increased at follow-up among frequent TC participants.
CONCLUSION: TC exercise practised among community-dwelling older adults is 
associated with better physical, cognitive and functional wellbeing.

The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA of bovine viral diarrhoea virus 
(BVDV), an economically significant Pestivirus, is required for the 
cap-independent translation of viral genomic RNA. Thus, it is essential for 
viral replication and pathogenesis. We applied a combination of high-throughput 
biochemical RNA structure probing (SHAPE-MaP) and in silico modelling approaches 
to gain insight into the secondary and tertiary structures of BVDV IRES RNA. Our 
study demonstrated that BVDV IRES RNA in solution forms a modular architecture 
composed of three distinct structural domains (I-III). Two regions within domain 
III are represented in tertiary interactions to form an H-type pseudoknot. 
Computational modelling of the pseudoknot motif provided a fine-grained picture 
of the tertiary structure and local arrangement of helices in the BVDV IRES. 
Furthermore, comparative genomics and consensus structure predictions revealed 
that the pseudoknot is evolutionarily conserved among many Pestivirus species. 
These studies provide detailed insight into the structural arrangement of BVDV 
IRES RNA H-type pseudoknot and encompassing motifs that likely contribute to the 
optimal functionality of viral cap-independent translation element.

University, Nanning 530021, China.

Youth is the core force of social and economic development, once the occurrence 
of youth stroke will place a heavy burden on society and family. However, the 
prevention and control of stroke in China is mainly aimed at middle-aged and 
elderly patients, the part of young stroke is relatively easy to be ignored. 
This article focuses on the characteristics, research progress, prevention and 
control status of young stroke, pointing out the importance of centering on the 
prevention and treatment of young stroke. At the same time, it hopes that the 
industry can concentrate on the prevention and treatment of young stroke, making 
precise policies in the future, and developing secondary prevention guidelines 
for the causes or risk factors of young stroke, so as to improve comprehensive 
stroke prevention and control system. On this basis, the health level of the 
whole population will be improved, and the life expectancy of residents will be 
extended, thus promoting the realization of the strategic goal of "Healthy China 
2030".

INTRODUCTION: the factors determining life expectancy (LE) are crucial for 
policymakers to study in implementing an effective and accurate intervention in 
society. In Oman, the available data over the past four decades were not 
extracted to develop a statistical model to understand how the sociodemographic 
(SD), macroeconomic (ME), and health-status and resources (HSR) factors 
affecting LE. The study was aimed at creating a representative model to explain 
the factors affecting LE in Oman and examine the direct and indirect effects of 
SD, ME, and HSR in LE in Oman.
METHODS: the research was a retrospective, ecological, time-series study design 
to collect the annual published data on SD, ME, and HSR in Oman from all 
available resources from 1978 to 2018. The data were then analyzed with 
structural equation modeling (SEM) method using IBM® SPSS® Amos 24 for the study 
of their impacts in LE.
RESULTS: in Oman, using SEM, the SD, ME, and HSR significantly and directly 
affected LE by the estimate of -0.92 (p < 0.001), -0.15 (p < 0.001), and 0.23 (p 
< 0.001) respectively.
CONCLUSION: the study was the first attempt to analyze all the different aspects 
of LE comprehensively in Oman. In the case of Oman, the health resource is an 
important factor that need to be addressed to increase or to maintain the 
current LE. Hence, during social hardship or economic recession, health-related 
support by the government should be continued or even improved because of its 
positive effect on LE.

Conventional cost-effectiveness analysis-i.e., assessing pharmaceuticals through 
a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) framework-originated from a 
societal commitment to maximize population health given limited resources. This 
"extra-welfarist" approach has produced pricing and reimbursement systems that 
are not well- aligned with the unique considerations of orphan drugs. This 
framework has been slow to evolve along with our increased understanding of the 
impact of rare diseases, which in turn has complicated the assessment of orphan 
drugs meant to treat rare diseases. Herein, we (i) discuss the limitations of 
conventional cost-effectiveness analysis as applied to assessing access to, as 
well as the pricing and reimbursement of, orphan drugs, (ii) critically appraise 
alternative and supplemental approaches, and (iii) offer insights on plausible 
steps forward.

With life expectancy for women on the rise, most women will experience 
menopausal transition and spend a significant number of years of their life in 
the menopausal phase. Menopausal transition involves a myriad of physical, 
endocrine, and psychological changes which are influenced by ethnic, 
psychological, and socio-cultural factors. Every woman's experience of the 
menopausal transition is unique, and a one-size-fits-all approach to the 
management of symptoms does not work. An understanding of the pathophysiology 
and severity of menopausal symptoms and the benefits and risks associated with 
both hormonal and non-hormonal treatments is important when individualising 
treatment options for menopausal symptoms.

Inborn errors of immunity are a group of rare diseases characterized by a wide 
variety of manifestations, including unusually severe infections, cancer 
susceptibility, and exaggerated inflammation that disrupts organ function. As of 
2022, over 450 gene deficiencies have been classified under ten categories, 
where numbers are constantly increasing. The range of inborn errors of immunity 
varies considerably, from mild infections to serious multisystemic disease. 
Whereas patients with T cell defects are liable to a broad range of pathogens, 
selected inborn errors of immunity may predispose hosts merely to a narrow range 
of microorganisms. Dysregulated immune responses often cause autoimmune 
manifestations that may target any organ or lead to severe allergies. Therefore, 
presentation to any medical discipline is possible. Historically, inborn errors 
of immunity have been associated with short life expectancy and poor life 
quality, but intensive research into the field has revolutionized this 
assumption. Especially with the aid of translational investigations, our 
clinical practice has transformed from a predominantly phenotype-driven 
management into one that is reinforced by an etiology-driven therapy. This 
review summarizes the recent advances in molecularly targeted treatment 
approaches in various inborn errors of immunity conditions, with many success 
stories corroborating the power of genomic medicine. The principles of 
applications learned from these rare monogenic traits, in which the functional 
impact of the molecular pathways is clear-cut, may be instructive for developing 
basic concepts toward precision therapy of the common immune-mediated disorders, 
including autoimmunity, infectious diseases, and allergy, which affect mass 
populations.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine cause-specific years of life lost 
(YLL) changes between predisaster and postdisaster in disaster-affected 
municipalities, compared with the national average. We estimated the YLL in Soma 
and Minamisoma cities (the subject area) in Fukushima, Japan, where the tsunami 
and the nuclear accident hit in 2011.
PARTICIPANTS: We used vital registration records from a national survey 
conducted between January 2006 and December 2015. We analysed 6369 death data in 
the predisaster period (2006-2010) and 6258 death data in the postdisaster 
period (2011-2015).
METHODS: We incorporated vital statistics data as follows: age-based, sex-based 
and International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision-based cause-specific 
deaths and calculated YLLs by ages 0, 40, 65 and 75 and sex for attributable 
causes of death for heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia, all 
cancers and specific cancers; breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukaemia, lung 
cancer, stomach cancer and uterine cancer for predisaster and postdisaster in 
the subject area.
RESULTS: YLL attributed to heart diseases for males showed no decrease and YLL 
postdisaster was 0.37 years larger than that of the national average at age 0. 
The difference was -0.17 (95% uncertainty interval: -0.40 to 0.05) years at age 
65. It decreased for females; the difference was 0.37 (0.18-0.57) years after 
the disaster. YLL decrease (that is, difference) in cerebrovascular diseases at 
age 0 was 0.27 (0.09-0.44) years and 0.18 (0.04-0.32) years; however, the YLLs 
postdisaster were still 0.24 and 0.25 years larger than those for the national 
average for males and females, respectively. YLL attributed to cancer did not 
increase even after the nuclear disaster.
CONCLUSIONS: We specified the causes of death to be reduced in disaster-affected 
areas in the future. This study emphasised the importance of understanding how 
the health situation changed for the whole society of the area from a 
comprehensive perspective, rather than focusing only on small mortality 
increases.

Combining remaining life expectancy and time to death as a measure of old-age 
dependency related to health care needs.

Spijker JJA(1).

Public concern about the rising number of older dependent citizens is still 
based mainly on standard population aging indicators. This includes the old-age 
dependency ratio (OADR), which divides the state pension age population by the 
working age population. However, the OADR counts neither the dependent elderly 
nor those who provide for them. This paper builds on previous research to 
propose several alternative indicators, including the health care (HC) 
need-adjusted real elderly dependency ratio and the HC need-adjusted dependent 
population-to-tax rate. These indicators consider improvements in old-age 
survival and time to death in order to better define the health care needs of 
the dependent old-age population and to better approximate their financial 
burden. We define the old-age population dependent on health care as those above 
the age at which remaining life expectancy is 15 years or less and are expected 
to die within 5 years. We use data from the US to illustrate differences between 
the proposed new and standard measures. Results show that, as a share of the 
total population, the old-age population dependent on health care has virtually 
not changed since 1950. Moreover, increases in GDP and state tax revenue have 
outstripped population aging almost continuously since 1970, irrespective of the 
indicator used, and they are expected to continue to do so during the coming 
decade. The demand for health care services is therefore not being fueled by 
population aging but instead by other factors such as progress in medical 
knowledge and technology, costs of hospitalization, and the increasing use of 
long-term care facilities.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relia-bility and 
validity of the lifestyle (Miller-Smith) and life expectancy (Schneider) 
questionnaires in the Italian setting in order to make this instrument available 
for the determination of lifestyle and hope level in the different domains of 
everyday life.
METHOD: Before testing their psychometric properties, the original versions of 
the two questionnaires, lifestyle (Miller-Smith) and life expectancy 
(Schneider), were translated into the Italian language. We tested the 
instrument's psychometric properties on a sample of 18 patients over 60 years 
old with Alzheimer's disease in the Sapienza University of Rome teaching 
hospital, policlinico Umberto 1. Internal consistency was considered to assess 
the reliability of the results across items within the adopted scale by using 
Cronbach's α coefficient. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test, the normality 
distribution was evaluated to guarantee the applicability of a parametric or 
non-parametric test. The software used to analyze data was SPSS version 26 for 
Windows.
RESULTS: According to the outcome of our statistical analysis, the lifestyle 
scale showed high overall internal consistency, and the Cron-bach's α 
coefficient for the total 20-item scale was 0.80 in the Italian population. On 
the other hand, using the 12-item questionnaire about life expectancy resulted 
in a high overall internal consistency of 0.93, according to the Cronbach's 
alpha test.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of our study shows that the Italian versions of the 
lifestyle (Miller-Smith) and life expectancy (Schneider) questionnaires 
demonstrated good psychometric properties and good characteristics of factorial 
validity for future epidemiological studies aimed at evaluating lifestyle and 
lifestyle expectancy in the Italian population and can as well be used in 
clinical practice and research.

BACKGROUND: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) still remains one of the leading 
causes of infant death worldwide, especially in high-income countries. To date, 
however, there is no detailed information on the global health burden of SIDS.
AIMS: To characterize the global disease burden of SIDS and its trends from 1990 
to 2019 and to compare the burden of SIDS according to the socio-demographic 
index (SDI).
DESIGN: Systematic analysis based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 
data.
METHODS: Epidemiological data of 204 countries from 1990 to 2019 were collected 
via various methods including civil registration and vital statistics in the 
original GBD study. Estimates for mortality and disease burden of SIDS were 
modeled. Crude mortality and mortality rates per 100 000 population were 
analyzed. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and DALY rates were also 
assessed.
RESULTS: In 2019, mortality rate of SIDS accounted for 20.98 [95% Uncertainty 
Interval, 9.15-46.16] globally, which was a 51% decrease from 1990. SIDS was
