(1)Project HOPE , HABITS for LIFE Program, Albuquerque, New Mexico .

BACKGROUND: HABITS for Life was a 3-year initiative to broadly deliver a 
statewide biometric and retinal screening program via a mobile unit throughout 
New Mexico at no charge to participants. The program goal-to identify health 
risk and improve population health status-was tested over a 3-year period. Value 
to participants and impact to the healthcare system were measured to quantify 
impact and value of investing in prevention at the community level.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Mobile Health Map Return-on-Investment 
Calculator, a mobile screening unit, biometric screening, retinography, and 
community coordination. Our systems included satellite, DSL, and 3G 
connectivity, a Tanita® (Arlington Heights, IL) automated body mass 
index-measuring scale, the Cholestec® (Alere™, Waltham, MA) system for 
biomarkers and glycosylated hemoglobin, a Canon (Melville, NY) CR-1 Mark II 
camera, and the Picture Archiving Communication System.
RESULTS: In this report for the fiscal year 2011 time frame, 6,426 individuals 
received biometric screening, and 5,219 received retinal screening. A 15:1 
return on investment was calculated; this excluded retinal screening for the 
under-65 year olds, estimated at $10 million in quality-adjusted life years 
saved. Statistically significant improvement in health status evidenced by 
sequential screening included a decrease in total cholesterol level (p=0.002) 
(n=308) and an increase in high-density lipoprotein level after the first and 
second screening (p=0.02 and p=0.01, respectively), but a decrease in mean 
random glucose level was not statistically significant (p=0.62). Retinal results 
indicate 28.4% (n=1,482) with a positive/abnormal finding, of which 1.79% (n=93) 
required immediate referral for sight-threatening retinopathy and 27% (n=1,389) 
required follow-up of from 3 months to 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening programs are cost-effective and provide value in 
preventive health efforts. Broad use of screening programs should be considered 
in healthcare redesign efforts. Community-based screening is an effective 
strategy to identify health risk, improve access, provide motivation to change 
health habits, and improve physical status while returning significant value.

Cost analysis of thyroid lobectomy and intraoperative frozen section versus 
total thyroidectomy in patients with a cytologic diagnosis of "suspicious for 
papillary thyroid cancer".

BACKGROUND: The optimal operation for a patient with a thyroid nodule 
"suspicious for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)" on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) 
is unclear. This study examines the incremental cost-utility of thyroid 
lobectomy with intraoperative frozen section (thyroid lobectomy) versus total 
thyroidectomy.
METHODS: Cost-utility analysis was performed for patients with a cytologic 
diagnosis of "suspicious for PTC" on FNA. Patients underwent either initial 
total thyroidectomy or thyroid lobectomy and, if needed, completion 
thyroidectomy. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR; 
US$/quality-adjusted-life-year [QALY]), was determined from a societal 
perspective.
RESULTS: The base-case ICUR of thyroid lobectomy is $90,776/QALY, strongly 
favoring total thyroidectomy as a more cost-effective modality. On sensitivity 
analyses, the model is sensitive to the accuracy of frozen section and to the 
rate of injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). Thyroid lobectomy is more 
cost-effective only if both frozen section and final pathology are benign in 
≥92% of patients (ICUR $47,959/QALY at 92%). With increasing rates of unilateral 
(>5%) or bilateral (>2%) RLN injury associated with total thyroidectomy, there 
is a trend toward thyroid lobectomy being more cost effective ($53,127 and 
$51,325/QALY, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In our model, initial total thyroidectomy is cost-effective for 
patients with a single thyroid nodule suspicious for PTC on FNA. Our results 
strongly support total thyroidectomy for initial treatment; thyroid lobectomy is 
preferred only when complications reach unacceptable levels.

Renal tumor ablation.

Georgiades C(1), Rodriguez R.

Author information:

g_christos@hotmail.com.

Percutaneous, image-guided ablation for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an 
important treatment option for many patients. With more than 60,000 new cases 
every year and nearly three-fourths of those presenting as stage 1A, minimally 
invasive, nephron-sparing therapies have become the standard of care. Stage 1 A 
(<4cm, organ confined) disease presents the best scenario for percutaneous 
ablation. Various other factors influence the decision-making tree, such as 
patient age, life expectancy, comorbid condition, renal function, and the risk 
of metachronous lesions. Preparation aims at minimizing risks and has been 
discussed in detail. Computed tomography guidance remains the best option, and 
conscious sedation is adequate for most cases. Ultrasound and more recently 
magnetic resonance guidance are becoming viable alternatives. Whether 
radiofrequency or cryoablation are chosen, a margin of at least 5mm and up to 
10mm is recommended. Various maneuvers required for optimum outcome, including 
hydrodissection and preoperative embolization are also discussed. Most renal 
ablations can be performed on an outpatient basis. Reasons to admit include 
complications, high-risk patients, and the need for symptom management. 
Follow-up aims at (1) ensuring complete ablation and (2) monitoring against a 
metachronous lesion. For the former, a 3-month contrast computed tomography or 
magnetic resonance imaging is required and for the latter an annual examination 
is recommended. Though partial nephrectomy remains the gold standard, 
image-guided, percutaneous ablation for RCC can result in very similar outcomes. 
Over the last 10 years, there have been numerous studies reporting the efficacy 
and safety of ablation, and more recently, long-term studies have confirmed 
those numbers. Overall, the efficacy for percutaneous ablation for RCC stands at 
90%-95% with a complication rate of 6%-7%. The most important factors for 
positive outcome are patient or tumor selection and operator experience.

cell carcinoma in Serbia.

BACKGROUND: New targeted therapeutics for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) 
enable an increment in progression-free survival (PFS) ranging from 2 to 6 
months. Compared with best supportive care, everolimus demonstrated an 
additional PFS of 3 months in patients with mRCC whose disease had progressed on 
sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The only targeted therapy for mRCC currently 
reimbursed in Serbia is sunitinib.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness and the 
budget impact of the introduction of everolimus in Serbia in comparison to best 
supportive care, for mRCC patients refractory to sunitinib.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed corresponding with Serbian treatment 
protocols. A health care payer perspective was taken, including direct costs 
only. Treated and untreated cohorts were followed up over 18 cycles, each cycle 
lasting 8 weeks, which covered the lifetime horizon of mRCC patients refractory 
to the first-line treatment. Annual discounted rates of 1.5% for effectiveness 
and 3% for costs were applied. Transitions between health states were modeled by 
time-dependent probabilities extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS 
and overall survival (OS). Utility values were obtained from the appraisals of 
other mRCC treatments. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were done 
to test the robustness and uncertainty of the base-case estimate. Lastly, the 
potential impacts of everolimus on the overall health care expenditures on 
annual and 4-year bases were estimated in the budget-impact analysis.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for everolimus was estimated 
at €86,978 per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analysis identified the 
hazard multiplier, a statistical approximator of OS gain, as the main driver of 
everolimus cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
revealed a wide 95% CI around the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
estimate (€32,594-€425,258 per quality-adjusted life-year). Finally, an average 
annual budgetary impact of everolimus in first 4 years after its potential 
reimbursement would be around €270,000, contributing to <1% of the total budget 
in Serbian oncology.
CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus as a second-line treatment of mRCC is not likely to be a 
cost-effective option under the present conditions in Serbia, with a relatively 
limited impact on its budget in oncology. A major constraint on the estimation 
of the cost-effectiveness of everolimus relates to the uncertainty around the 
everolimus effect on extending OS. However, prior to a final decision on the 
acceptance/rejection of everolimus, reassessment of the whole therapeutic group 
might be needed to construct an economically rational treatment strategy within 
the mRCC field.

Biomedical Research Unit, RKCSB, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.

OBJECTIVE: The lower procedural risk associated with endovascular aneurysm 
repair (EVAR) compared with open aneurysm repair (OAR) is well known. Younger 
patients are likely to represent a group at low perioperative risk. The 
long-term durability and late complications following EVAR may have more 
significance when considering the optimal treatment for young patients with a 
longer life expectancy. This study examined perioperative and long-term outcomes 
of young patients undergoing aneurysm repair by either open surgical or 
endovascular means.
METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively collated database was 
performed. Patients undergoing elective aneurysm repair at the age of 65 years 
or younger between January 2000 and September 2010 were included. All EVAR 
patients were followed up in a nurse-led clinic. Data regarding long-term 
outcomes for patients undergoing open repair were gathered from case note 
review.
RESULTS: There were 99 patients who underwent open repair and 59 patients who 
underwent endovascular repair. Groups were well matched in terms of demographics 
and co-morbidities. 30-day mortality was 1% after open repair. There were no 
perioperative deaths after endovascular repair. Overall, 30-day complication 
rates were 15% after open repair and 12% after EVAR. The nature of complications 
differed between the two groups with the EVAR group experiencing endoleaks and 
the OAR group demonstrating more cardiorespiratory complications. Mean follow-up 
was 75.5 months and there was a 14% reintervention rate after EVAR compared with 
7% after OAR.
CONCLUSION: Young patients are likely to have a lower procedural risk for EVAR 
and OAR than described in published figures. Although mortality and complication 
rates in these two groups were similar, the nature of complications occurring 
following open surgery were often more significant than those occurring after 
EVAR. There remains a risk of late reintervention following either form of 
repair.

PURPOSE: Surgical conditions represent a significant source of global disease 
burden. Little is known about the epidemiology of inguinal hernia in 
resource-poor settings. We present a method to estimate inguinal hernia disease 
burden in Tanzania.
METHODS: Using data from the United States National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) prospective cohort study and Tanzanian demographic 
figures, we calculated inguinal hernia incidence and prevalence in Tanzanian 
adults under three surgical rate scenarios. Gender-specific incidence figures 
from NHANES data were adjusted according to Tanzanian population age structure. 
Hernia duration was adjusted for Tanzanian life expectancy within each age 
group.
RESULTS: The prevalence of inguinal hernia in Tanzanian adults is 5.36% while an 
estimated 12.09% of men had hernias. Today, 683,904 adults suffer from 
symptomatic inguinal hernia in Tanzania. The annual incidence of symptomatic 
hernias in Tanzanian adults is 163 per 100,000 population. At Tanzania's current 
hernia repair rate, a backlog of 995,874 hernias in need of repair will develop 
over 10 years. 4.4 million disability-adjusted life-years would be averted with 
repair of prevalent symptomatic hernias in Tanzania.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate the extent of inguinal hernia disease burden in 
Tanzania. By adjusting our figures for the age structure of Tanzania, we have 
demonstrated that while the incidence of symptomatic cases may be lower than 
previously thought, prevalence of inguinal hernia in Tanzania remains high. This 
approach provides an update to our previously described methodology for 
calculation of inguinal hernia epidemiology in resource-poor settings that may 
be used in multiple country contexts.

Thoughts on the start and withdrawal of dialysis.

[Article in English, Spanish]

Sánchez-Tomero JA.

Increased life expectancy and the availability of treatments provided by modern 
medicine have given rise to a new situation in which survival may be prolonged 
without the patient having an acceptable quality of life. Renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) to treat End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) may involve the use of 
aggressive techniques designed to improve and prolong the lives of patients with 
high comorbidity and very low short term survival expectancy. RRT often means 
lowering patients&rsquo; quality of life, it is a significant burden on families 
and survival expectancy is low. Patients must actively participate in 
decision-making, but to do so, the information about the prognosis of their 
disease and how the treatment will affect their quality of life must be more 
comprehensive. As nephrologists, we will be able to contribute better to 
decision-making by improving prognostic tools and participating collectively 
with the patient and their family in the final decision. It is necessary to 
offer appropriate care to patients who opt for conservative treatment by 
implementing multidisciplinary teams within ESRD units.

A flexible semiparametric transformation model for recurrent event data.

Dong L(1), Sun L.

Author information:
(1)Institute of Applied Mathematics, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, 
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing , 100190, People's Republic of China.

In this article, we propose a class of semiparametric transformation models for 
recurrent event data, in which the baseline mean function is allowed to depend 
on covariates through an additive model, and some covariate effects are allowed 
to be time-varying. For inference on the model parameters, estimating equation 
approaches are developed, and the asymptotic properties of the resulting 
estimators are established. In addition, a lack-of-fit test is presented to 
assess the adequacy of the model. The finite sample behavior of the proposed 
estimators is evaluated through simulation studies, and an application to a 
bladder cancer study is illustrated.

Lifespan variation by occupational class: compression or stagnation over time?

van Raalte AA(1), Martikainen P, Myrskylä M.

Author information:
(1)Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany, 
vanRaalte@demogr.mpg.de.

Cross-sectional analyses of adult lifespan variation have found an inverse 
association between socioeconomic position and lifespan variation, but the 
trends by social class are unknown. We investigated trends in lifespan variation 
over four decades (1971-2010) by occupational social class (manual, lower 
nonmanual, upper nonmanual, other) using Finnish register data. We performed age 
and cause-of-death decompositions of lifespan variation for each sex (a) by 
occupational class over time and (b) between occupational classes at a shared 
level of life expectancy. Although life expectancy increased in all classes, 
lifespan variation was stable among manual workers and decreased only among 
nonmanual classes. These differences were caused by early-adult mortality: 
older-age lifespan variation declined for all the classes, but variation in 
early-adult mortality increased for all classes except the highest. The manual 
class's high and stagnant lifespan variation was driven by declines in 
circulatory diseases that were equally spread over early mortality-compressing 
and older mortality-expanding ages, as well as by high early-adult mortality 
from external causes. Results were similar for men and women. The results of 
this study, which is the first to document trends in lifespan variation by 
social class, suggest that mortality compression is compatible with increasing 
life expectancy but currently achieved only by higher occupational classes.

A model-based economic evaluation of improved primary care management of 
patients with type 2 diabetes in Australia.

Haji Ali Afzali H(1), Gray J, Beilby J, Holton C, Karnon J.

Adelaide, Level 7, 178 North Terrace, Adelaide, SA, 5005, Australia,

BACKGROUND: There are few studies investigating the economic value of the 
Australian practice nurse workforce on the management of chronic conditions. 
This is particularly important in Australia, where the government needs evidence 
to inform decisions on whether to maintain or redirect current financial 
incentives that encourage practices to recruit practice nurses.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with two models of practice nurse 
involvement in clinical-based activities (high and low level) in the management 
of type 2 diabetes within the primary care setting.
METHODS: A previously validated state transition model (the United Kingdom 
Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model) was adapted, which uses baseline 
prognostic factors (e.g. gender, haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]) to predict the risk of 
occurrence of diabetes-related complications (e.g. stroke). The model was 
populated by data from Australian and UK observational studies. Costs and 
utility values associated with complications were summed over patients' 
lifetimes to estimate costs and QALY gains from the perspective of the health 
care system. All costs were expressed in 2011 Australian dollars (AU$). The 
base-case analysis assumed a 40-year time horizon with an annual discount rate 
of 5 %.
RESULTS: Relative to low-level involvement of practice nurses in the provision 
of clinical-based activities, the high-level model was associated with lower 
mean lifetime costs of management of complications (-AU$8,738; 95 % confidence 
interval [CI] -AU$12,522 to -AU$4,954), and a greater average gain in QALYs 
(0.3; 95 % CI 0.2-0.4). A range of sensitivity analyses were performed, in which 
the high-level model was dominant in all cases.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the high-level model is a dominant 
management strategy over the low-level model in all modelled scenarios. These 
findings indicate the need for effective primary care-based incentives to 
encourage general practices not only to employ practice nurses, but to better 
integrate them into the provision of clinical services.

The cost effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators: a systematic 
review of economic evaluations.

Health, 196 Alexandras Avenue, 115 21, Athens, Greece.

BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the most common cause of death in 
developed countries, with more than 3 million people dying yearly. Implantable 
cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are considered to be an effective treatment 
in the primary and secondary prevention of SCD; however, their cost is 
considerable and this poses questions regarding whether they are worth the 
investment relative to less expensive pharmacotherapy.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to investigate existing evidence 
regarding the cost effectiveness of ICD therapy and to identify the key drivers 
of cost effectiveness, for the purpose of informing interested policy and 
decision makers.
METHODOLOGY: A systematic review of the literature concerning the cost 
effectiveness of ICDs was undertaken. Electronic databases, including PubMed, 
Cochrane and Health Economic Evaluations Database were searched based on 
appropriate terms and their combinations. Economic evaluation studies that 
examined the cost effectiveness of ICDs were selected and 34 were included for 
evaluation.
RESULTS: Findings from the present analysis show that ICD therapy, in properly 
selected patients who are at high risk of sudden cardiac death, is associated 
with similar or better cost-effectiveness ratios compared with other well 
accepted conventional treatments. The cost effectiveness of ICDs is influenced 
by several factors, including ICD efficacy and safety, impact on patient quality 
of life, device original implantation cost, frequency and cost of battery 
replacement, patient demographics and risk profile and analysis time horizon.
CONCLUSION: ICDs may represent a cost-effective option relative to 
pharmacotherapy in appropriately selected patient groups. The cost-effectiveness 
ratios appear to be at acceptable and comparable levels to other established 
treatments in cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases. However, cost 
effectiveness is highly related to several factors and hence economic efficiency 
is highly dependent on conditions that need to be fulfilled for each individual 
case in medical practice. The aforementioned factors and technological advances 
imply that to ensure cost-effective use of ICD therapy, continuous research is 
needed.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on 
insulin therapy have inadequate glycaemic control. In such cases, Dutch 
guidelines recommend unlimited up-titration of insulin, yet in practice many 
patients never reach their glycaemic target. Clinical evidence shows that 
dapagliflozin-a highly selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor-meets 
a need for these patients, i.e. by reducing glycated haemoglobin levels and 
bodyweight. We estimated the cost effectiveness and cost utility of adding 
dapagliflozin to insulin compared with not adding dapagliflozin in patients with 
T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control while on insulin.
METHODS: The cost effectiveness of dapagliflozin was estimated using the Cardiff 
Diabetes Model, using direct comparative efficacy data from a randomized 
placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00673231). In this 
trial, up-titration of insulin was allowed in case of severe glycaemic 
imbalance. Risk factor progression and the occurrence of future vascular events 
were estimated using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 68 risk 
equations. Costs and utilities were derived from the literature. The analysis 
was conducted from the societal perspective, simulating the remaining lifetime 
of the patients.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of macro- and microvascular complications was 
lower, and life expectancy was greater (19.43 versus 19.35 life-years [LYs]) in 
patients receiving dapagliflozin than in those not receiving dapagliflozin. 
Patients in the dapagliflozin arm obtained an incremental benefit of 0.42 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The lifetime incremental cost per patient 
in the dapagliflozin arm was €2,293, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €27,779 per LY gained and an incremental 
cost-utility ratio of €5,502 per QALY gained. Sensitivity and scenario analyses 
showed that the results were insensitive to variations in modelling assumptions 
and input variables.
CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin in combination with insulin was estimated to be a 
cost-effective treatment option for patients with T2DM whose insulin treatment 
regimen does not provide adequate glycaemic control in a Dutch healthcare 
setting.

CONTEXT: Acromegaly is associated with reduced life expectancy, which has been 
reported to be normalized if treatment is successful in controlling GH/IGF-I 
levels.
OBJECTIVE: Most previous studies have invariably used the last available 
GH/IGF-I, which may be biased as it only assesses exposure at a single point in 
time. We compared the last available GH/IGF-I analysis to a "time-dependent" and 
cumulative method, during follow-up to assess risk of mortality in the West 
Midlands Acromegaly study (n = 501).
RESULTS: Using the last available GH, there was a statistically significant 
increase in mortality comparing groups as low as GH ≤ 1 μg/L vs >1 μg/L 
(relative risks [RR] 1.8, P = .03). This was not the case when using the 
"time-dependent method," where only comparisons of GH values of GH ≤5 μg/L vs >5 
μg/L were suggestive of being associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR 
= 1.5, P = .08). When the time-dependent GH method of analysis was used, the RR 
of mortality at each level was lower and the associated P value was less 
significant. Irrespective of using the last available or time-dependent method, 
when IGF-I was divided into levels according to quartile or arbitrary cutoffs, 
there was no significant increase in mortality with higher levels.
CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the potential bias of using the latest 
available GH/IGF-I levels to predict mortality. Our study again highlights the 
limitations of IGF-I in predicting mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abiraterone, cabazitaxel, and 
enzalutamide compared to placebo for treatment of metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A decision-tree model compared three treatment options for 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients over 18 months from a 
societal perspective in 2012 USD. Chance nodes included baseline pain as a 
severity indicator, significant adverse effects (neutropenia, cardiac events, or 
seizures), and survival. Probabilities, survival rates, and health utilities 
were from clinical trials (COU-AA, TROPIC, and AFFIRM) and other published 
studies. Survival of enzalutamide was adjusted to match placebo groups across 
trials. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses, acceptability curves and net benefit 
calculations were performed.
RESULTS: Abiraterone was the most cost-effective of the treatments ($123.4 
K/quality-adjusted life year) compared to placebo, enzalutamide was $437.6 
K/quality-adjusted life year compared to abiraterone, and cabazitaxel was $351.9 
K/quality-adjusted life year compared to enzalutamide. Enzalutamide and 
cabazitaxel were not cost-effective compared to placebo at $154.3 
K/quality-adjusted life year and $163.2 K/quality-adjusted life year, 
respectively. Acceptability curves showed abiraterone was cost-effective 29.3% 
of the time with a willingness to pay threshold of $100 K. The model was 
sensitive to changes in cost of the drugs, life expectancy, and survival rate. 
Sensitivity analysis shows that enzalutamide can become the most cost-effective 
option if the price of the medication decreased by 26% and other drug costs 
remained the same.
CONCLUSION: Based on the cost-effective analysis, and survival adjustments 
necessary to match placebo groups, we would recommend abiraterone for treatment 
of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer despite not quite falling 
under the usually accepted willingness to pay threshold. Further analysis should 
examine comparative survival across the three drugs.

USA.

Diuretics have been recommended as first-line treatment of hypertension and are 
also valuable in the management of hypervolemia and electrolyte disorders. This 
review summarizes the key features of the most commonly used diuretics. We then 
provide an update of clinical trials for diuretics during the past 5 years. 
Compared to other classes of medications, thiazide diuretics are at least as 
effective in reducing cardiovascular events (CVEs) in patients with hypertension 
and are more effective than β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors in reducing stroke. Observational cohort data and a network analysis 
have shown that CVEs are lowered by one-fifth from chlorthalidone when compared 
to the commonly used thiazide, hydrochlorothiazide. Relative to placebo, 
chlorthalidone increases life expectancy. In those aged 80 years and older, the 
diuretic, indapamide, lowers CVEs relative to placebo. The aldosterone 
antagonist, eplerenone, lowers total mortality in early congestive heart 
failure. The benefit of eplerenone following acute myocardial infarction (MI) is 
limited to administration within 3 to 6 days post-MI. Aldosterone antagonists 
have been shown to lower the incidence of sudden cardiac death and to reduce 
proteinuria. In the setting of heart failure, long acting loop diuretics 
azosemide and torasemide are more effective in improving heart failure outcomes 
than the far more commonly used short acting furosemide. Evening dosing of 
diuretics appears to lower CVEs relative to morning dosing. In conclusion, 
diuretics are a diverse class of drugs that remain extremely important in the 
management of hypertension and hypervolemic states.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease with autosomal recessive inheritance 
and is common in Caucasian people. The prevalence of this disease is between 
1/2,000 and 1/3,500 live births, and the incidence varies between populations. 
Although the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene is expressed in the 
kidneys, renal involvement is rare. With advances in the treatment of CF, life 
expectancy has increased, and some previously unobserved disease associations 
are now seen in patients with CF. It is important to follow patients with CF for 
possible abnormalities that may accompany CF. In this paper, we present two rare 
cases of CF accompanied by nephrotic syndrome.

BACKGROUND: In dementia screening, most studies have focused on early cognitive 
impairment by comparing patients suffering from mild dementia or mild cognitive 
impairment with normal subjects. Few studies have focused on modifications over 
time of the cognitive function in the healthy elderly. The objective of the 
present study was to analyze the cognitive function changes of two different 
samples, born > 15 years apart.
METHOD: A first sample of 204 cognitively normal participants was recruited in 
the memory clinic of Broca hospital between 1991 and 1997. A second sample of 
177 cognitively normal participants was recruited in 2008-2009 in the same 
institution. Both samples were from the same districts of Paris and were 
assessed with the same neuropsychological test battery. Mean cognitive test 
scores were compared between 1991 and 2008 samples, between < 80 years old and ≥ 
80 years old in 1991 and 2008 samples, and finally between subjects < 80 year 
old of 1991 sample and subjects ≥ 80 years old of the 2008 sample. Means were 
compared with T-tests stratified on gender, age-groups and educational level.
RESULTS: Cognitive scores were significantly higher in the 2008 sample. 
Participants < 80 years old outperformed those ≥ 80 in both samples. However, 
participants < 80 years old in 1991 sample and subjects ≥ 80 in the 2008 sample, 
born on average in 1923, performed mostly identically.
CONCLUSION: This study showed a significant increase of cognitive scores over 
time. Further, contemporary octogenarians in the later sample performed like 
septuagenarians in the former sample. These findings might be consistent with 
the increase in life expectancy and life span in good health. The study 
highlights the necessity to take into account factors which may contaminate and 
artificially inflate the age-related differences in favor of younger to the 
older adults.

HIV-1 Tat-mediated induction of CCL5 in astrocytes involves NF-κB, AP-1, C/EBPα 
and C/EBPγ transcription factors and JAK, PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK signaling 
pathways.

The incidence of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND) has increased 
during recent years even though the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 
has significantly curtailed the virus replication and increased the life 
expectancy among HIV-1 infected individuals. These neurological deficits have 
been attributed to HIV proteins including HIV-1 Tat. HIV-1 Tat is known to 
up-regulate CCL5 expression in mouse astrocytes, but the mechanism of 
up-regulation is not known. The present study was undertaken with the objective 
of determining the mechanism(s) underlying HIV-1 Tat-mediated expression of CCL5 
in astrocytes. SVGA astrocytes were transiently transfected with a plasmid 
encoding Tat, and expression of CCL5 was studied at the mRNA and protein levels 
using real time RT-PCR and multiplex cytokine bead array, respectively. HIV-1 
Tat showed a time-dependent increase in the CCL5 expression with peak mRNA and 
protein levels, observed at 1 h and 48 h post-transfection, respectively. In 
order to explore the mechanism(s), pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA against 
different pathway(s) were used. Pre-treatment with SC514 (NF-κB inhibitor), 
LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor) and Janex-1 (JAK3 inhibitor) 
showed partial reduction of the Tat-mediated induction of CCL5 suggesting 
involvement of JAK, PI3K/Akt and NF-κB in CCL5 expression. These results were 
further confirmed by knockdown of the respective genes using siRNA. Furthermore, 
p38 MAPK was found to be involved since the knockdown of p38δ but not other 
isoforms showed partial reduction in CCL5 induction. This was further confirmed 
at transcriptional level that AP-1, C/EBPα and C/EBPγ were involved in CCL5 
up-regulation.

Arabidopsis AtRRP44A is the functional homolog of Rrp44/Dis3, an exosome 
component, is essential for viability and is required for RNA processing and 
degradation.

The RNA exosome is a multi-subunit complex that is responsible for 3' to 5' 
degradation and processing of cellular RNA. Rrp44/Dis3 is the catalytic center 
of the exosome in yeast and humans. However, the role of Rrp44/Dis3 homologs in 
plants is still unidentified. Here, we show that Arabidopsis AtRRP44A is the 
functional homolog of Rrp44/Dis3, is essential for plant viability and is 
required for RNA processing and degradation. We characterized AtRRP44A and 
AtRRP44B/SOV, two predicted Arabidopsis Rrp44/Dis3 homologs. AtRRP44A could 
functionally replace S. cerevisiae Rrp44/Dis3, but AtRRP44B/SOV could not. 
rrp44a knock-down mutants showed typical phenotypes of exosome function 
deficiency, 5.8S rRNA 3' extension and rRNA maturation by-product 
over-accumulation, but rrp44b mutants did not. Conversely, AtRRP44B/SOV mutants 
showed elevated levels of a selected mRNA, on which rrp44a did not have 
detectable effects. Although T-DNA insertion mutants of AtRRP44B/SOV had no 
obvious phenotype, those of AtRRP44A showed defects in female gametophyte 
development and early embryogenesis. These results indicate that AtRRP44A and 
AtRRP44B/SOV have independent roles for RNA turnover in plants.

Are lifestyle interventions in primary care cost-effective?--An analysis based 
on a Markov model, differences-in-differences approach and the Swedish Björknäs 
study.

BACKGROUND: Lifestyle interventions affect patients' risk factors for metabolic 
syndrome (MeSy), a pre-stage to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and related 
complications. An effective lifestyle intervention is the Swedish Björknäs 
intervention, a 3-year randomized controlled trial in primary care for MeSy 
patients. To include future disease-related cost and health consequences in a 
cost-effectiveness analysis, a simulation model was used to estimate the 
short-term (3-year) and long-term (lifelong) cost-effectiveness of the Björknäs 
study.
METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A Markov micro-simulation model was used to 
predict the cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for MeSy-related 
diseases based on ten risk factors. Model inputs were levels of individual risk 
factors at baseline and at the third year. The model estimated short-term and 
long-term costs and QALYs for the intervention and control groups. The 
cost-effectiveness of the intervention was assessed using 
differences-in-differences approach to compare the changes between the groups in 
the health care and societal perspectives, using a 3% discount rate. A 95% 
confidence interval (CI), based on bootstrapping, and sensitivity analyses 
describe the uncertainty in the estimates. In the short-term, costs are 
predicted to increase over time in both groups, but less in the intervention 
group, resulting in an average cost saving/reduction of US$-700 (in 2012, 
US$1=six point five seven SEK) and US$-500, in the societal and health care 
perspectives. The long-term estimate also predicts increased costs, but 
considerably less in the intervention group: US$-7,300 (95% CI: US$-19,700 to 
US$-1,000) in the societal, and US$-1,500 (95% CI: US$-5,400 to US$2,650) in the 
health care perspective. As intervention costs were US$211 per participant, the 
intervention would result in cost saving. Furthermore, in the long-term an 
estimated 0.46 QALYs (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.69) per participant would be gained.
CONCLUSIONS/ SIGNIFICANCE: The Swedish Björknäs study appears to reduce demands 
on societal and health care resources and increase health-related quality of 
life.

Estimating EQ-5D and OAB-5D health state utilities for patients with overactive 
bladder.

BACKGROUND: Limited utility data on patients suffering from overactive bladder 
(OAB) are available in the literature. The objectives of this study were to 
estimate utility values in patients with OAB using the generic EQ-5D 
questionnaire and the OAB-5D disease specific questionnaire, to investigate the 
relationship between utilities and symptoms, and to evaluate the sensitivity of 
the two instruments to changes in symptom severity.
METHODS: Analyses were based on pooled data from three large multicenter 
randomized 12-week placebo-controlled trials (SCORPIO, ARIES, CAPRICORN). 
Patients completed a micturition diary, EQ-5D and OAB-q (a quality of life 
questionnaire from which OAB-5D is derived) at baseline and at weeks 4, 8 and 
12. Time trade-off tariffs elicited from UK population were applied to obtain 
utilities from both instruments. Repeated measures regressions were used to 
estimate EQ-5D and OAB-5D utilities by micturition frequency and incontinence 
severity level. As a test of sensitivity of the instruments, utility changes 
from baseline to week 12 were estimated by symptomatic response (improvement, 
stable or worsening).
RESULTS: The sample included 4427 patients. Mean utilities (± standard 
deviation) across all visits were 0.82 (± 0.21) for EQ-5D and 0.86 (±0.09) for 
OAB-5D. Correlation between EQ-5D and OAB-5D was 0.34 (p < 0.0001). Both OAB-5D 
and EQ-5D utilities increased as OAB symptoms improved. Utility values were 
similar for severe levels of symptoms, but higher with OAB-5D than with EQ-5D 
for mild cases. Micturitions and incontinence had similar impact on EQ-5D 
utilities, but micturitions had greater impact on OAB-5D utilities than 
incontinence. Changes from baseline in OAB-5D utilities differed significantly 
according to symptomatic response. Changes in EQ-5D utilities were not 
significantly associated with changes in micturition frequency and weakly 
associated with changes in incontinence severity among patients with mild 
symptoms at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that both EQ-5D and OAB-5D can detect changes in 
severity of OAB, especially in severe cases. However, OAB-5D is more sensitive 
than EQ-5D in measuring differences between treatments in milder cases. Both 
OAB-5D and EQ-5D-although leading to different results-may be useful to derive 
utilities from clinical trial data and perform cost-effectiveness analyses.
