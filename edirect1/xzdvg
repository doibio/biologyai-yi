CONCLUSIONS: The overall mortality and DALYs of TBL cancer burden related to OCs 
showed a decreasing trend between 1990 and 2019, whereas death number increased. 
Asbestos accounted for the highest death number. TBL cancer burden related to 
OCs decreased to different degrees in high, low, low-middle, and middle SDI 
countries, which showed variable levels of TBL cancer burden related to exposure 
to OCs (except asbestos).

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the trends in disease burden of diabetes-related chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) by year, age, gender and types of diabetes in China from 
1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data on prevalence, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
for diabetes-related CKD were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
2019 study. Analyses were performed by year, age, gender and types of diabetes.
RESULTS: In China, the numbers of deaths and DALYs of diabetes-related CKD 
continuously increased but the age-standardized rates (per 100,000 population) 
decreased over 30 years, in which the numbers of deaths and DALYs attributable 
to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)-related CKD barely changed and the 
age-standardized rates decreased over the years; and the number of deaths and 
DALYs attributable to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-related CKD continuously 
increased, but the age-standardized rates also decreased. In 2019, 76.03 
(58.24-95.61) thousand deaths and 2.13 (1.65-2.67) million DALYs were 
attributable to diabetes-related CKD, of which, T2DM accounted for 83.32% and 
77.0% respectively, and T1DM accounted for the rest. Increasing gender disparity 
was seen, with males being more heavily impacted. The burden of diabetes-related 
CKD varied among different age groups, with the numbers of deaths and DALYs 
attributable to T1DM-related CKD peaking between 45 and 54 years of age and 
T2DM-related CKD peaking between 75 and 79 years of age; and the crude rates of 
deaths and DALYs attributable to T1DM-related CKD peaking between 70 and 79 
years of age and 40 to 54 years of age, respectively, and T2DM-related CKD 
peaking over 90 years of age. Among neighboring and G20 countries, the burden of 
diabetes-related CKD in China was relatively controlled reflected by the ranking 
of adjusted death and DALYs rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of diabetes-related CKD in China worsens and shows 
gender disparities and different age distribution. Greater efforts are needed to 
improve the health outcomes of these patients, especially among males.

Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disease characterized by a worldwide 
distribution and a natural tendency towards progression. According to the many 
clinical forms, the extension of the disease and the many comorbidities, almost 
the 20% of the patients require a systemic treatment. Biologics have greatly 
changed the ongoing of psoriasis and the quality of life of psoriasis patients. 
After the anti-TNF-alpha, which were the first biologics in use for psoriasis, 
the improvement in knowledge of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the 
disease has led to the development of a series of more specific therapies for 
psoriasis. This "second generation" of biologics includes the interleukin 
(IL)-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab, IL-17 inhibitors (secukinumab and ixekizumab), 
the IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) antagonist brodalumab, and the IL-23 inhibitors 
guselkumab, risankizumab and tildrakizumab. This study represents an update of 
the Tuscany consensus focused on the use of new drugs, such as anti-IL-17 and 
anti-IL-23 in moderate-to-severe psoriasis and their correct place in therapy 
according to specific clinical requests and in full respect of the current 
financial restrictions.

A series of σ-π extended octamethyltetrasilanes, which have phenothiazine, 
9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine, or phenoxazine (1, 2, and 3) groups as donor 
moieties and thienopyrazine or benzothiadiazole (a and b) groups as acceptor 
fragments, has been prepared, and their optical properties have been studied as 
an extension of our work. All six compounds exhibited fluorescence in the solid 
state with maximum wavelengths centered in the range of 400 and 650 nm upon 
excitation by a UV lamp. Compound 2b showed apparent dual emission behavior in 
solution, which depends on solvent polarity, and a reversible photoluminescent 
change under mechanical and thermal stimuli in the solid state. Quantum chemical 
calculations suggest the contribution of a quasi-axial conformer of the 
9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine moiety in 2b to the dual emission in solution 
and the mechanofluoroluminescence in the solid state, similarly to 1a. These 
studies provide new insight into the preparation of disilane-bridged triads 
capable of responding to multiple stimuli.

Chemoradiotherapy.

Esophageal cancer (EC) is the eighth most prevalent malignancy and the sixth 
leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The proportion of older adults 
with EC has increased dramatically in recent decades due to increased life 
expectancy. Older patients with EC are at a highest risk of malnutrition and 
this predicts early death. In older patients with EC, dysphagia is a common 
symptom; additionally, comorbidities, polypharmacy, and physiological changes of 
aging such as decreased muscle mass and geriatric issues including altered 
cognition, mobility, and mood contribute to malnutrition. Chemoradiotherapy 
(CRT) is the primary treatment for unresectable locally advanced EC patients, as 
it successfully reduces local recurrence and distant metastases while also 
extending survival. In older patients with EC, nutrition is an interventional 
condition, unlike many other geriatric risk factors. Optimizing nutritional 
support may reduce treatment toxicity and facilitate the completion of 
definitive or neoadjuvant CRT. The relevance of nutritional status and food 
intake is becoming more widely acknowledged, and it now encompasses the entire 
spectrum of EC treatment in older patients, from diagnosis to perioperative care 
to long-term care. This review aims to discuss the current research on 
nutritional support in older patients with esophageal cancer undergoing CRT.

Although attenuated IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) signaling has 
long been viewed to promote longevity in model organisms, adverse effects on the 
heart have been the subject of major concern. We observed that IGF1R is 
overexpressed in cardiac tissues from patients with end-stage non-ischemic heart 
failure, coupled to the activation of the IGF1R downstream effector AKT/protein 
kinase B and inhibition of ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1). 
Transgenic overexpression of human IGF1R in cardiomyocytes from mice initially 
induces physiological cardiac hypertrophy and superior function, but later in 
life confers a negative impact on cardiac health, causing 
macroautophagy/autophagy inhibition as well as impaired oxidative 
phosphorylation, thus reducing life expectancy. Treatment with the autophagy 
inducer and caloric restriction mimetic spermidine ameliorates most of these 
IGF1R-induced cardiotoxic effects in vivo. Moreover, inhibition of IGF1R 
signaling by means of a dominant-negative phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) 
mutant induces cardioprotective autophagy, restores myocardial bioenergetics and 
improves late-life survival. Hence, our results demonstrate that IGF1R exerts a 
dual biphasic impact on cardiac health, and that autophagy mediates the 
late-life geroprotective effects of IGF1R inhibition in the heart.

Difference in Cost-Effectiveness between First-Line and Third-Line or Later 
Nivolumab Therapy in Patients with HER2-Negative, Unresectable, Advanced or 
Recurrent Gastric or Gastro-Esophageal Junction Cancer in Japan.

Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University.

A model-based, cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to evaluate the 
difference in cost-effectiveness of nivolumab (NIVO), between first-line therapy 
in combination with chemotherapy and third-line or later monotherapy for 
patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent gastric or gastro-esophageal 
junction cancer, with the aim of supporting the economic evaluation of 
healthcare in Japan. Data on overall survival and progression-free survival were 
obtained from the phase 3 clinical trials, ATTRACTION-4 and ATTRACTION-2. A 
partitioned survival model was developed to predict costs and outcomes. Direct 
medical costs were considered from the perspective of the Japanese national 
health insurance (NHI) payer. The model time horizon was set to 10 years. Health 
outcomes were defined as life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NIVO compared 
to the control group was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
assess the uncertainty of parameter setting. A willingness-to-pay threshold of 
15 million JPY (Japanese yen) was used. Compared to each control group, the 
ICERs for NIVO treatment per 1 LY gained were 65745714 JPY for first-line 
treatment, 7420202 JPY for third-line or later treatment, and 74750097 JPY and 
10496602 JPY per QALY gained, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
estimated that the probability of NIVO treatment being cost-effective for 
first-line and third-line treatment was 23.5 and 74.3%, respectively. From the 
perspective of the Japanese NHI payer, NIVO was cost-effective as third-line or 
later monotherapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer, but not in 
combination with first-line chemotherapy.

High-quality affinity probes are critical for sensitive and specific protein 
detection, in particular for detection of protein biomarkers in the early phases 
of disease development. Proximity extension assays (PEAs) have been used for 
high-throughput multiplexed protein detection of up to a few thousand different 
proteins in one or a few microliters of plasma. Clonal affinity reagents can 
offer advantages over the commonly used polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) in terms of 
reproducibility and standardization of such assays. Here, we explore nanobodies 
(Nbs) as an alternative to pAbs as affinity reagents for PEA. We describe an 
efficient site-specific approach for preparing high-quality oligo-conjugated Nb 
probes via enzyme coupling using Sortase A (SrtA). The procedure allows 
convenient removal of unconjugated affinity reagents after conjugation. The 
purified high-grade Nb probes were used in PEA, and the reactions provided an 
efficient means to select optimal pairs of binding reagents from a group of 
affinity reagents. We demonstrate that Nb-based PEA (nano-PEA) for interleukin-6 
(IL6) detection can augment assay performance, compared to the use of pAb 
probes. We identify and validate Nb combinations capable of binding in pairs 
without competition for IL6 antigen detection by PEA.

Health care spending effectiveness is the ratio of an increase in spending per 
case of illness or injury to an increase in disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) averted per case. We report US spending-effectiveness ratios, using 
comprehensive estimates of health care spending from the Disease Expenditure 
Project and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. We decomposed 
changes over time to estimate spending per case and DALYs averted per case, 
controlling for changes in population size, age-sex structure, and incidence or 
prevalence of cases. Across all causes of health care spending and disease 
burden, median spending was US$114,339 per DALY averted between 1996 and 2016. 
Twelve of thirty-four causes with the highest spending or highest burden had 
median spending that was less than $100,000 per DALY averted. Using 
decomposition results, we calculated an outcome-adjusted health care price index 
by assigning a dollar value to DALYs averted per case. When we used $100,000 as 
the dollar value per DALY averted, prices increased by 4 percent more than the 
broader economy; when we used $150,000 per DALY averted, relative prices fell by 
13 percent, meaning that much of the growth in health care spending over time 
has purchased health improvements.

INTRODUCTION: Peptides are widely recognized as therapeutic agents in the 
treatment of a wide range of diseases, such as cancer and diabetes. However, 
their use has been limited by their short half-life, due to significant 
metabolism by exo- and endo-peptidases as well as their inherent poor physical 
and chemical stability. Research with the aim of improving their half-life in 
the body and thus improving patient compliance (by decreasing the frequency of 
injections) has gained significant attention.
AREAS COVERED: This review outlines the current landscape and industrial 
approaches to achieve extended peptide exposure and reduce dosing frequency. 
Emphasis is placed on identifying challenges in drug product manufacturing and 
desirable critical quality attributes that are essential for activity and 
safety, providing insights into chemistry and design aspects impacting peptide 
release, and summarizing important considerations for CMC developability 
assessments of sustained release peptide drugs.
EXPERT OPINION: Bring the patient and disease perspective early into 
development. Substantial advances have been made in the field of sustained 
delivery of peptides despite their complexity. The article will also highlight 
considerations for early-stage product design and development, providing an 
industrial perspective on risk mitigation in developing sustained release 
peptide drug products.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been shown to be effective and generally safe 
across a continually expanding list of therapeutic areas. We describe the 
advantages and limitations of mAbs as a therapeutic option compared with small 
molecules. Specifically, we discuss a novel mAb in the treatment of hereditary 
angioedema (HAE), a rare and potentially life-threatening condition 
characterized by recurrent unpredictable swelling attacks. HAE is mediated by 
dysregulation of plasma kallikrein activity leading to overproduction of 
bradykinin. Current prophylactic treatment for HAE includes androgens or 
replacement of the endogenous plasma kallikrein inhibitor, C1 inhibitor. 
However, there remains an unmet need for an effective, less burdensome treatment 
option. Lanadelumab is a fully human mAb targeting plasma kallikrein. Results 
from clinical trials, including a pivotal Phase 3 study and its ensuing 
open-label extension study, demonstrated that lanadelumab is associated with few 
treatment-related adverse events and reduced the rate of HAE attacks. This novel 
treatment option has the potential to significantly improve the lives of 
patients with HAE.

INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) greatly impacts quality of 
life and eventually leads to premature death from respiratory failure. Inhaled 
treprostinil was associated with improvements in forced vital capacity (FVC) and 
reduced exacerbations of underlying lung disease in post hoc analyses from a 
phase 3 study in patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension due to 
interstitial lung disease. These results, combined with preclinical evidence of 
treprostinil's antifibrotic activity, support its investigation in the treatment 
of IPF.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The TETON programme consists of two replicate, 52-week, 
randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies, each enrolling 396 
subjects (NCT04708782, NCT05255991). Eligible subjects must have a diagnosis of 
IPF confirmed by central imaging review, along with an FVC ≥45%. Stable 
background use of pirfenidone or nintedanib is allowed. The primary endpoint is 
change in absolute FVC at week 52. Secondary endpoints include time to clinical 
worsening (first event of death, respiratory hospitalisation or ≥10% decline in 
% predicted FVC), time to first acute exacerbation of IPF, overall survival, 
change in % predicted FVC and change in the King's Brief Interstitial Lung 
Disease Questionnaire at week 52. Safety parameters include adverse events, 
hospitalisations, oxygenation and laboratory parameters. Patients who complete 
week 52 will be eligible to enter an open-label extension study.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Studies will be conducted in accordance with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 
Declaration of Helsinki principles, and local regulatory, ethical and legal 
requirements. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed publication.

BACKGROUND: Residential wood combustion (RWC) is one of the largest sources of 
fine particles (PM2.5) in the Nordic cities. The current study aims to calculate 
the related health effects in four studied city areas in Sweden, Finland, 
Norway, and Denmark.
METHODS: Health impact assessment (HIA) was employed as the methodology to 
quantify the health burden. Firstly, the RWC induced annual average PM2.5 
concentrations from local sources were estimated with air pollution dispersion 
modelling. Secondly, the baseline mortality rates were retrieved from the 
national health registers. Thirdly, the concentration-response function from a 
previous epidemiological study was applied. For the health impact calculations, 
the WHO-developed tool AirQ + was used.
RESULTS: Amongst the studied city areas, the local RWC induced PM2.5 
concentration was lowest in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (population-weighted 
annual average concentration 0.46 µg m- 3) and highest in Oslo (2.77 µg m- 3). 
Each year, particulate matter attributed to RWC caused around 19 premature 
deaths in Umeå (95% CI: 8-29), 85 in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (95% CI: 
35-129), 78 in Copenhagen (95% CI: 33-118), and 232 premature deaths in Oslo 
(95% CI: 97-346). The average loss of life years per premature death case was 
approximately ten years; however, in the whole population, this reflects on 
average a decrease in life expectancy by 0.25 (0.10-0.36) years. In terms of the 
relative contributions in cities, life expectancy will be decreased by 0.10 (95% 
CI: 0.05-0.16), 0.18 (95% CI: 0.07-0.28), 0.22 (95% CI: 0.09-0.33) and 0.63 (95% 
CI: 0.26-0.96) years in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Umeå, Copenhagen and 
Oslo respectively. The number of years of life lost was lowest in Umeå (172, 95% 
CI: 71-260) and highest in Oslo (2458, 95% CI: 1033-3669).
CONCLUSIONS: All four Nordic city areas have a substantial amount of domestic 
heating, and RWC is one of the most significant sources of PM2.5. This 
implicates a substantial predicted impact on public health in terms of premature 
mortality. Thus, several public health measures are needed to reduce the RWC 
emissions.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that the pathophysiological impact of 
acute burn injuries may have chronic health consequences. We conducted a 
systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between burn 
injuries and long-term mortality in patients surviving to initial discharge from 
hospital.
METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched on 22 October 2021. Studies 
were eligible for inclusion if they compared long-term mortality amongst burn 
survivors to non-injured controls from the general population. When the same 
output metrics related to mortality were reported, meta-analyses were undertaken 
using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs 
Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool.
RESULTS: Following an extensive literature search, six studies (seven articles) 
were identified for inclusion. They were predominantly based in high-income 
countries, with each comparing burns' survivors to matched non-injured controls 
from the general population. The four studies included in the meta-analysis had 
a combined unadjusted odds ratio of 2.65 (1.84 - 3.81; 95 % confidence interval) 
and adjusted mortality rate ratio of 1.59 (1.31 - 1.93; 95 % confidence 
interval). Thus, burn survivors demonstrated greater mortality rates when 
compared to their non-injured counterparts. Similar findings were illustrated in 
the remaining studies not included in the meta-analysis, with the exception of 
one study which found no significant difference between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that acute burn injuries may be associated with 
greater long-term mortality rates (unadjusted and adjusted). The underlying 
mechanism is unclear and further work is required to establish the role of 
certain factors such as biological ageing processes, to improve outcomes for 
burn patients.

Manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD) begin early in childhood and cause 
morbidity and decreased life expectancy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT) is curative but associated with risk of mortality attributable to the 
transplant. This risk should be counterbalanced with SCD morbidity and 
mortality. A severity score using a Bayesian network model was previously 
validated to predict the risk of death in adult individuals with SCD. The 
objective of this study is to calculate the severity scores of participants in a 
multicenter cohort of Brazilians with SCD, using a previously published Bayesian 
network-derived score, associated with risk of death and then compare the 
severity scores between participants with and without an indication for HSCT as 
defined by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) criteria. This is an 
observational, retrospective study. We analyzed 2063 individuals with sickle 
cell anemia from the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III 
Brazil SCD cohort and applied a Bayesian network-derived score to compare 
candidates and non-candidates for HSCT according to the Brazilian MoH transplant 
criteria. Classical statistical methods were used to analyze data and make 
comparisons. We compared severity scores between cohort members with (n = 431) 
and without (n = 1632) HSCT indications according to Brazilian MoH. Scores were 
not different in adult participants with ≥1 HSCT indication when compared to 
those with no indication (mean 0.342 versus 0.292; median 0.194 versus 0.183, 
P = .354) and receiver operating characteristic curves did not demonstrate an 
obvious threshold to differentiate participants with or without HSCT 
indications. Severity score may predict risk of death but does not differentiate 
HSCT candidates. Current indications should be evaluated to ensure that patients 
with more severe disease who might benefit from HSCT are appropriately 
identified.

Frailty, a state of reduced physiological reserve, has not been studied in 
consumers with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, despite known elevated rates 
of comorbidity and psychosocial impairment. This study applies a frailty index 
to the electronic medical records of 78 adults with treatment-resistant 
schizophrenia, aged 18-64 years, to determine the prevalence and characteristics 
of frailty (defined as a frailty index score > 0.21). The mean frailty index 
score was 0.24 (SD = 0.091, range = 0.061-0.54), with 52.6% of the population 
categorised as frail (40.0% in those aged 18-39 years). Frailty was positively 
correlated with age and psychiatric illness severity. This study provides novel 
evidence that individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia have a high 
rate of frailty and become frail at a younger age. Routine frailty assessments 
could be used to trigger the delivery of appropriate interventions, which have 
the potential to improve life expectancy and quality of life.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition, characterised by 
joint pain, damage and disability, which can be addressed in a high proportion 
of patients by timely use of targeted biologic treatments. However, the 
patients, non-responsive to the treatments often suffer from refractoriness of 
the disease, leading to poor quality of life. Additionally, the biologic 
treatments are expensive. We obtained plasma samples from N = 144 participants 
with RA, who were about to commence anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) 
therapy. These samples were sent to Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden, where 
proximity extension assays of 4 panels, containing 92 proteins each, were 
performed. A total of n = 89 samples of patients passed the quality control of 
anti-TNF treatment response data. The preliminary analysis of plasma protein 
expression values suggested that the RA population could be divided into two 
distinct molecular sub-groups (endotypes). However, these broad groups did not 
predict response to anti-TNF treatment, but were significantly different in 
terms of gender and their disease activity. We then labelled these patients as 
responders (n = 60) and non-responders (n = 29) based on the change in disease 
activity score (DAS) after 6 months of anti-TNF treatment and applied machine 
learning (ML) with a rigorous 5-fold nested cross-validation scheme to filter 17 
proteins that were significantly associated with the treatment response. We have 
developed a ML based classifier ATRPred (anti-TNF treatment response predictor), 
which can predict anti-TNF treatment response in RA patients with 81% accuracy, 
75% sensitivity and 86% specificity. ATRPred may aid clinicians to direct 
anti-TNF therapy to patients most likely to receive benefit, thus save cost as 
well as prevent non-responsive patients from refractory consequences. ATRPred is 
implemented in R.

IMPORTANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin, 
characterized by formation of long chains of hemoglobin when deoxygenated within 
capillary beds, resulting in sickle-shaped red blood cells, progressive 
multiorgan damage, and increased mortality. An estimated 300 000 infants are 
born annually worldwide with SCD. Most individuals with SCD live in sub-Saharan 
Africa, India, the Mediterranean, and Middle East; approximately 100 000 
individuals with SCD live in the US.
OBSERVATIONS: SCD is diagnosed through newborn screening programs, where 
available, or when patients present with unexplained severe atraumatic pain or 
normocytic anemia. In SCD, sickling and hemolysis of red blood cells result in 
vaso-occlusion with associated ischemia. SCD is characterized by repeated 
episodes of severe acute pain and acute chest syndrome, and by other 
complications including stroke, chronic pain, nephropathy, retinopathy, 
avascular necrosis, priapism, and leg ulcers. In the US, nearly all children 
with SCD survive to adulthood, but average life expectancy remains 20 years less 
than the general population, with higher mortality as individuals transition 
from pediatric to adult-focused health care systems. Until 2017, hydroxyurea, 
which increases fetal hemoglobin and reduces red blood cell sickling, was the 
only disease-modifying therapy available for SCD and remains first-line therapy 
for most individuals with SCD. Three additional therapies, L-glutamine, 
crizanlizumab, and voxelotor, have been approved as adjunctive or second-line 
agents. In clinical trials, L-glutamine reduced hospitalization rates by 33% and 
mean length of stay from 11 to 7 days compared with placebo. Crizanlizumab 
reduced pain crises from 2.98 to 1.63 per year compared with placebo. Voxelotor 
increased hemoglobin by at least 1 g/dL, significantly more than placebo (51% vs 
7%). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the only curative therapy, but it is 
limited by donor availability, with best results seen in children with a matched 
sibling donor. While SCD is characterized by acute and chronic pain, patients 
are not more likely to develop addiction to pain medications than the general 
population.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the US, approximately 100 000 people have SCD, 
which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, acute and chronic pain, acute chest 
syndrome; increased incidence of stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy; and a 
life span that is 20 years shorter than the general population. While 
hydroxyurea is first-line therapy for SCD, L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and 
voxelotor have been approved in the US since 2017 as adjunctive or second-line 
treatments, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant with a matched sibling donor 
is now standard care for severe disease.

In daily life, we frequently encounter actions performed by other people. Here 
we aimed to examine the key categories and features underlying the organization 
of a wide range of actions in three behavioral experiments (N = 378 
participants). In Experiment 1, we used a multi-arrangement task of 100 
different actions. Inverse multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering 
revealed 11 action categories, including Locomotion, Communication, and 
Aggressive actions. In Experiment 2, we used a feature-listing paradigm to 
obtain a wide range of action features that were subsequently reduced to 59 key 
features and used in a rating study (Experiment 3). A direct comparison of the 
feature ratings obtained in Experiment 3 between actions belonging to the 
categories identified in Experiment 1 revealed a number of features that appear 
to be critical for the distinction between these categories, e.g., the features 
Harm and Noise for the category Aggressive actions, and the features Targeting a 
person and Contact with others for the category Interaction. Finally, we found 
that a part of the category-based organization is explained by a combination of 
weighted features, whereas a significant proportion of variability remained 
unexplained, suggesting that there are additional sources of information that 
contribute to the categorization of observed actions. The characterization of 
action categories and their associated features serves as an important extension 
of previous studies examining the cognitive structure of actions. Moreover, our 
results may serve as the basis for future behavioral, neuroimaging and 
computational modeling studies.
