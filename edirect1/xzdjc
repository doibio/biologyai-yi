BACKGROUND: Metabolic-bariatric surgery delivers substantial weight loss and can 
induce remission or improvement of obesity-related risks and complications. 
However, more robust estimates of its effect on long-term mortality and life 
expectancy-especially stratified by pre-existing diabetes status-are needed to 
guide policy and facilitate patient counselling. We compared long-term survival 
outcomes of severely obese patients who received metabolic-bariatric surgery 
versus usual care.
METHODS: We did a prespecified one-stage meta-analysis using patient-level 
survival data reconstructed from prospective controlled trials and high-quality 
matched cohort studies. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE (via Ovid) for 
randomised trials, prospective controlled studies, and matched cohort studies 
comparing all-cause mortality after metabolic-bariatric surgery versus 
non-surgical management of obesity published between inception and Feb 3, 2021. 
We also searched grey literature by reviewing bibliographies of included studies 
as well as review articles. Shared-frailty (ie, random-effects) and stratified 
Cox models were fitted to compare all-cause mortality of adults with obesity who 
underwent metabolic-bariatric surgery compared with matched controls who 
received usual care, taking into account clustering of participants at the study 
level. We also computed numbers needed to treat, and extrapolated life 
expectancy using Gompertz proportional-hazards modelling. The study protocol is 
prospectively registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42020218472.
FINDINGS: Among 1470 articles identified, 16 matched cohort studies and one 
prospective controlled trial were included in the analysis. 7712 deaths occurred 
during 1·2 million patient-years. In the overall population consisting 174 772 
participants, metabolic-bariatric surgery was associated with a reduction in 
hazard rate of death of 49·2% (95% CI 46·3-51·9, p<0·0001) and median life 
expectancy was 6·1 years (95% CI 5·2-6·9) longer than usual care. In subgroup 
analyses, both individuals with (hazard ratio 0·409, 95% CI 0·370-0·453, 
p<0·0001) or without (0·704, 0·588-0·843, p<0·0001) baseline diabetes who 
underwent metabolic-bariatric surgery had lower rates of all-cause mortality, 
but the treatment effect was considerably greater for those with diabetes 
(between-subgroup I2 95·7%, p<0·0001). Median life expectancy was 9·3 years (95% 
CI 7·1-11·8) longer for patients with diabetes in the surgery group than the 
non-surgical group, whereas the life expectancy gain was 5·1 years (2·0-9·3) for 
patients without diabetes. The numbers needed to treat to prevent one additional 
death over a 10-year time frame were 8·4 (95% CI 7·8-9·1) for adults with 
diabetes and 29·8 (21·2-56·8) for those without diabetes. Treatment effects did 
not appear to differ between gastric bypass, banding, and sleeve gastrectomy (I2 
3·4%, p=0·36). By leveraging the results of this meta-analysis and other 
published data, we estimated that every 1·0% increase in metabolic-bariatric 
surgery utilisation rates among the global pool of metabolic-bariatric 
candidates with and without diabetes could yield 5·1 million and 6·6 million 
potential life-years, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: Among adults with obesity, metabolic-bariatric surgery is 
associated with substantially lower all-cause mortality rates and longer life 
expectancy than usual obesity management. Survival benefits are much more 
pronounced for people with pre-existing diabetes than those without.
FUNDING: None.

BACKGROUND: Aging is an inevitable physiological process, associated with a 
decline in cognitive function. Recently, metformin, as the first-line treatment 
for type II diabetes, has been shown to increase the life expectancy of diabetic 
patients. Therefore, researchers are paying increasing attention to its 
anti-aging properties. Oxygen free radicals are responsible for oxidative 
stress, which is a prominent factor in age-associated diseases. This study aimed 
to evaluate the effects of long-term administration of metformin on 
age-dependent oxidative stress and cognitive function.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 32 normal (nondiabetic) male Wistar rats 
were randomly assigned into control and metformin groups (n = 16 per group). The 
metformin group received 100 mg/kg of metformin in drinking water daily for six 
months. The shuttle box test was used for the passive avoidance task in 
24-month-old rats. For the biochemical assay, the total antioxidant capacity 
(TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level were measured. Nissl and TUNEL staining 
were also used for histopathological assessments. Data were analyzed using 
independent t-test.
RESULTS: The present findings revealed that metformin significantly reduced the 
MDA level and increased the TAC in the hippocampus of the metformin group 
(p < 0.05). The survival of hippocampal CA1 neurons was significantly higher in 
the metformin group as compared to the control group, while the number of 
TUNEL-positive neurons decreased significantly (p < 0.05). On the other hand, 
metformin markedly improved the passive avoidance memory in the metformin group 
as compared to the control group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that long-term metformin intake, by modulating 
the oxidant/antioxidant mechanisms, prevents the loss of hippocampal neurons 
caused by age-dependent oxidative stress and improves memory.

PURPOSE: With nearly two-thirds of chronic disease attributed to lifestyle, 
there is a need for physician assistants (PA) to develop competencies in 
Lifestyle Medicine (LM). The purpose of this study was to assess PA students' 
skill competencies in exercise and dietary prescription to guide curriculum 
implementation efforts.
METHODS: An online survey was administered to PA students at a single 
institution.
RESULTS: Overall, 74 (63%) students completed the survey, self-reporting 
moderate competence (range: 1-6) in conducting a physical exam to approve an 
exercise program (4.17 ± 1.22), designing a nutritional plan (3.76 ± 1.32), and 
designing an exercise prescription (3.50 ± 1.32). Only about half of the 
clinical students felt competent in conducting a physical examination to approve 
an exercise program (56%), determine maximal heart rate (54%), and design a 
nutritional plan (58%), and only 25% reported competence in designing an 
exercise prescription. Additionally, 84% of clinical students reported time 
spent on LM in their program as "poor" or inadequate, and 100% wanted to learn 
more.
CONCLUSIONS: PA students reported inadequate competence and knowledge in LM but 
expressed an unanimous interest in learning more about LM during their 
educational training.

AIMS: Percutaneous coronary intervention reduces mortality in acute coronary 
syndrome patients but the cost-utility of increasing its use in elderly acute 
coronary syndrome patients is unknown.
METHODS: We assessed the efficiency of increased percutaneous coronary 
intervention use compared to current practice in patients aged ≥75 years 
admitted for acute coronary syndrome in France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal 
and Spain with a semi-Markov state transition model. In-hospital mortality 
reduction estimates by percutaneous coronary intervention use and costs were 
derived from the EUROpean Treatment & Reduction of Acute Coronary Syndromes cost 
analysis EU project (n = 28,600). Risk of recurrence and out-of-hospital 
all-cause mortality were obtained from the Information System for the 
Development of Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) database from North-Eastern 
Spain (n = 55,564). In-hospital mortality was modelled using stratified 
propensity score analysis. The 8-year acute coronary syndrome recurrence risk 
and out-of-hospital mortality were estimated with a multistate survival model. 
The scenarios analysed were to increase percutaneous coronary intervention use 
among patients with the highest, moderate and lowest probability of receiving 
percutaneous coronary intervention based on the propensity score analysis.
RESULTS: France, Greece and Portugal showed similar total costs/1000 individuals 
(7.29-11.05 m €); while in Germany, Italy and Spain, costs were higher 
(13.53-22.57 m €). Incremental cost-utility ratios of providing percutaneous 
coronary intervention to all patients ranged from 2262.8 €/quality adjusted life 
year gained for German males to 6324.3 €/quality adjusted life year gained for 
Italian females. Increasing percutaneous coronary intervention use was 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 10,000 €/quality adjusted 
life year gained for all scenarios in the six countries, in males and females.
CONCLUSION: Compared to current clinical practice, broadening percutaneous 
coronary intervention use in elderly acute coronary syndrome patients would be 
cost-effective across different healthcare systems in Europe, regardless of the 
selected strategy.

AIMS: An exhaustive and updated estimation of cardiovascular disease burden and 
vascular risk factors is still lacking in European countries. This study aims to 
fill this gap assessing the global Italian cardiovascular disease burden and its 
changes from 1990 to 2017 and comparing the Italian situation with European 
countries.
METHODS: All accessible data sources from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease 
study were used to estimate the cardiovascular disease prevalence, mortality and 
disability-adjusted life years and cardiovascular disease attributable risk 
factors burden in Italy from 1990 to 2017. Furthermore, we compared the 
cardiovascular disease burden within the 28 European Union countries.
RESULTS: Since 1990, we observed a significant decrease of cardiovascular 
disease burden, particularly in the age-standardised prevalence (-12.7%), 
mortality rate (-53.8%), and disability-adjusted life years rate (-55.5%). 
Similar improvements were observed in the majority of European countries. 
However, we found an increase in all-ages prevalence of cardiovascular diseases 
from 5.75 m to 7.49 m Italian residents. Cardiovascular diseases still remain 
the first cause of death (34.8% of total mortality). More than 80% of the 
cardiovascular disease burden could be attributed to known modifiable risk 
factors such as high systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, high low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, and impaired kidney function.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a decline in cardiovascular mortality and 
disability-adjusted life years, which reflects the success in reducing 
disability, premature death and early incidence of cardiovascular diseases. 
However, the burden of cardiovascular diseases is still high. An approach that 
includes the cooperation and coordination of all stakeholders of the Italian 
National Health System is required to further reduce this burden.

We use harmonized household panel data from Europe and the US and a three-state 
survival model to provide comparable measurements of education and gender 
inequalities in total, healthy, and unhealthy life expectancies at age 50. 
Common across countries, the education advantage in total life expectancy is 
larger for males but the education advantage in (fewer) unhealthy years is 
larger for females. Counterfactual decompositions show that these results arise 
because the education advantage in conditional survival rates is relatively more 
important for males, while the education advantage in better health transitions 
is relatively more important for females. Across countries, the US stands out 
with the largest education gradient in healthy life expectancy.

Hamburg, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Loneliness and social isolation both have been linked to morbidity 
and mortality. However, there is a lack of studies investigating whether these 
factors are associated with expectations of longevity. Therefore, we aimed to 
clarify this association.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were taken from a nationally representative sample 
of middle-aged and older individuals (analytical sample, n = 4857). 
Well-established scales were used to measure loneliness and social isolation. 
Equally to other large cohort studies, expectations of longevity were assessed 
using the question 'What age do you think you will live to?' It was adjusted for 
various socioeconomic and health-related factors.
RESULTS: After adjusting for various socioeconomic and health-related 
covariates, multiple linear regressions showed that both loneliness (total 
sample: β = -0.97, P < 0.001; men: β = -1.04, P < 0.001; women: β = -0.97, 
P < 0.01) and social isolation (total sample: β = -0.93, P < 0.001; men: 
β = -0.86, P < 0.001; women: β = -0.91, P < 0.01) were associated with lower 
expectations of longevity in the total sample and stratified by gender. 
Furthermore, lower expectations of longevity were consistently associated with 
younger age (β = 0.32, P < 0.001), being retired (β = -2.39, P < 0.001), not 
being employed (β = -1.97, P < 0.001), worse self-rated health (β = -1.31, 
P < 0.001), and a higher number of chronic illnesses (β = -0.38, P < 0.001) in 
the total sample, and in both genders.
CONCLUSIONS: Even after adjusting for various covariates, findings still 
indicate an association between both loneliness and social isolation and 
markedly lower expectations of longevity. Future studies based on longitudinal 
data are required to gain further insights.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease which impacts the 
quality of life in elderly patients and imposes a significant burden to families 
and caregivers. The prolonged life expectancy and rapidly increasing world 
population significantly increased the morbidity. Although it has been widely 
reported that the aggregation of Beta amyloid and neurofilaments is the most 
significant pathological change. Currently, there is no effective drug therapy 
for AD, and the potential risks of pharmacotherapy remain concerns. This article 
reviews the recent research on Doll therapy (DT), a widely used non-drug therapy 
on AD patients, especially its clinical effectiveness and precautions in 
treating AD, with an attempt to further alleviate the mental symptoms and 
improve the health status of AD patients. Thus, nonpharmacological treatments of 
AD have become an area of intense research interest in recent years. DT is a 
person-centered therapy that can improve both the mental and cognitive status 
and the quality of life in AD patients. Although there remains ethical 
controversy about the DT on AD patients, its positive effect has been proved. 
Moreover, a standards manual is required to stipulate the range of application, 
the time course for treatment and withdraw the toy from the patients.

Aims: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding prolonged-release 
(PR)-fampridine to best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone for the 
improvement of walking ability in patients with MS.Methods: A cost-utility 
analysis based on a Markov model was developed to model responders and timed 
25-foot walk (T25FW) scores, accumulated costs, and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALY) in adults with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores 
between 4 and 7. The analysis was conducted from a Swedish societal 
perspective.Results: In the base-case analysis, PR-fampridine plus BSC led to a 
higher QALY gain than BSC alone. The largest direct cost was professional care 
provision followed by hospital inpatient stays while the indirect cost was the 
loss of earnings due to days off work. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) for PR-fampridine plus BSC compared with BSC alone was 57,109 Swedish 
Kronor (kr)/QALY (€5,607/QALY [1 kr = €0.0981762 on 8 April 2021] and 
$6,675/QALY [1 kr = $0.116890 on 8 April 2021]). All sensitivity analyses 
performed resulted in ICERs below 500,000 kr (€49,088 and $58,445).Limitations: 
Resource use data were not specific to the Swedish market.Conclusions: 
PR-fampridine represents a cost-effective treatment for MS-related walking 
impairment in Sweden, due to improvements in patients' quality of life and 
reduced healthcare resource utilization.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to develop a Markov model and apply it for 
the evaluation of three different treatment scenarios for adult patients with 
severe to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective Observational Study.
SETTINGS: Hospital.
PATIENTS: A clinical group of 22 adult patients (59.1% men, 40.9% women) aged 
from 59.13 ± 8.9 years were included in the study. The study comprised two arms: 
patients in group 1 received the second cochlear implant one to three months 
after the first implant; while patients in group 2 got the second cochlear 
implant approximately one year after the first implant.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All participants were first asked to complete an AQoL-8D 
questionnaire. For the cost-effectiveness analyses, a Markov model analyzed as 
microsimulation was developed to compare the different treatment options.
RESULTS: The analyses show that bilateral cochlear implantation strategies are 
cost-effective compared to the 'no treatment' alternative when having a 10-year 
model time horizon. When all three model scenarios are compared, the bilateral 
simultaneous cochlear implantation strategy (Scenario 3) compared to the 'no 
treatment' option is even more cost-effective than the Scenarios 1 and 2, 
compared with the 'no treatment' alternative.
CONCLUSIONS: The model results summarize that bilateral (sequential and 
simultaneous) cochlear implantation that are represented in the model scenarios, 
are cost-effective strategies for Polish adult patients with bilateral severe to 
profound sensorineural hearing loss.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare genetic disease that affects several organs, but 
lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. The gene responsible 
for CF, the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene, has 
been discovered in 1989. Since then, gene therapy i.e., defective gene 
replacement by a functional one, remained the ultimate goal but unfortunately, 
it has not yet been achieved. However, patients care and symptomatic treatments 
considerably increased CF patients' life expectancy ranging from 5 years old in 
the 1960s to 40 today. In the last decade, research works on CFTR protein 
structure and activity led to the development of new drugs which, by 
readdressing CFTR to the plasma membrane (correctors) or by enhancing its 
transport activity (potentiators), allow, alone or in combination, an 
improvement of CF patients' lung function and quality of life. While expected, 
it is not yet known whether taking these drugs from an early age and for years 
will improve the quality of life of CF patients in the long term and further 
increase their life expectancy. Besides, these molecules are not available 
(specific variants of CFTR) or accessible (national health policies) for all 
patients and there is still no curative treatment. Another alternative that 
could benefit from new technologies, such as gene therapy, is therefore still 
attractive, although it is not yet offered to patients. Faced with the 
development of new CFTR correctors and potentiators, the question arises as to 
whether there is still a place for gene therapy and this is discussed in this 
perspective.

As important electron carriers, ferredoxin (Fd) proteins play important roles in 
photosynthesis, and the assimilation of CO2, nitrate, sulfate, and other 
metabolites. In addition to the well-studied Fds, plant genome encodes two 
Fd-like protein members named FdC1 and FdC2, which have extension regions at the 
C-terminus of the 2Fe-2S cluster. Mutation or overexpression of FdC genes caused 
alterations in photosynthetic electron transfer rate in rice and Arabidopsis. 
Maize genome contains one copy of each FdC gene. However, the functions of these 
genes have not been reported. In this study, we identified the ZmFdC2 gene by 
forward genetics approach. Mutation of this gene causes impaired photosynthetic 
electron transport and collapsed chloroplasts. The mutant plant is 
seedling-lethal, indicating the indispensable function of ZmFdC2 gene in maize 
development. The ZmFdC2 gene is specifically expressed in photosynthetic tissues 
and induced by light treatment, and the encoded protein is localized on 
chloroplast, implying its specialized function in photosynthesis. Furthermore, 
ZmFdC2 expression was detected in both mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells, 
the two cell types specialized for C4 and C3 photosynthesis pathways in maize. 
Epigenomic analyses showed that ZmFdC2 locus was enriched for active histone 
modifications. Our results demonstrate that ZmFdC2 is a key component of the 
photosynthesis pathway and is crucial for the development of maize.

Introduction  The routine practice of neck dissection in the surgical management 
of oral carcinoma has evolved into a more functionally conservative approach. 
Over time, the rationale for removal of the submandibular gland has been 
questioned. Routine extirpation of the submandibular gland can aggravate the 
xerostomia experienced by many patients, significantly affecting their quality 
of life. Objective  The objective of the present study was to determine the 
incidence of submandibular gland metastases in oral cavity carcinoma and to 
identify possible factors that may affect their involvement. Methods  A total of 
149 cases of oral carcinoma presenting at a private tertiary care hospital in 
Karachi, Pakistan, over the course of 1 year were reviewed retrospectively. 
Results  Histopathological data showed that the submandibular gland was involved 
in 7 (4.7%) cases. Involvement of level I lymph nodes was found in all of the 
cases. Direct extension of primary tumor was noted in two cases when the primary 
tumor was in the floor of the mouth. Conclusion  The results suggest that 
preservation of the submandibular gland during neck dissection for oral 
carcinoma can be practiced safely when there is no evidence of direct extension 
of the primary tumor toward the submandibular gland or when there is no clinical 
or radiological evidence of neck disease in level I. Presence of pathological 
lymph nodes in level I requires caution when contemplating preservation of the 
submandibular gland.

Background: This study estimates the total discounted value of human lives lost 
(TDVHL) due to COVID-19 in France as of 14 September 2020. Methods: The human 
capital approach (HCA) model was used to estimate the TDVHL of the 30,916 human 
lives lost due to COVID-19 in France; i.e., assuming a discount rate of 3% and 
the national average life expectancy at birth of 83.13 years. To test the 
robustness of the estimated TDVHL, the model was rerun (a) using 5% and 10% 
discount rates, while holding the French average life expectancy constant; and 
(b) consecutively substituting national life expectancy with the world average 
life expectancy of 73.2 years and the world highest life expectancy of 88.17 
years.  Results: The human lives lost had a TDVHL of Int$10,492,290,194, and an 
average value of Int$339,381 per human life lost. Rerun of the HCA model with 5% 
and 10% discount rates decreased TDVHL by Int$1,304,764,602 (12.4%) and 
Int$3,506,938,312 (33%), respectively. Re-calculation of the model with the 
world average life expectancy decreased the TDVHL by Int$7,750,187,267 (73.87%). 
Contrastingly, re-estimation of the model with the world's highest life 
expectancy augmented TDVHL by Int$3,744,263,463 (35.7%). Conclusions: The 
average discounted economic value per human life lost due to COVID-19 of 
Int$339,381 is 8-fold the France gross domestic product per person. Such 
evidence constitutes an additional argument for health policy makers when making 
a case for increased investment to optimise France's International Health 
Regulation capacities and coverage of essential health services, and safely 
managed water and sanitation services.

Objectives Falls are a serious problem that can reduce living autonomy and 
health-related quality of life of older adults. A decrease in the muscular 
strength of the lower limbs and the deterioration of balance or motor 
performance deficits may lead to falls. "Motor Control Home Ergonomics 
Elderlies' Prevention of Falls" (McHeELP) is a novel motor control exercise 
program combined with ergonomic arrangements of the home environment. This pilot 
trial is conducted in order to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the 
McHeELP program, the selection of the most appropriate outcome measures, and the 
exact sample size calculation that should be used for the randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) with Clinical Trial Identifier: ISRCTN15936467. Patients and methods 
Twenty older adults (aged ≥65 years) who had experienced at least one 
fall-incident in the past 12 months have participated in the trial; they were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the McHeELP group (McHeELP-G) and the Control group 
(CG). The McHeELP-G received a personalized therapeutic motor control and 
learning exercise program performed three times per week for 12 weeks. Regarding 
McHeELP - home modification, a booklet that contained basic advice and tips on 
the modification for their inside and outside home environment was provided to 
the participants. Objective and self-reported outcome measures, collected at 
baseline and post-intervention (end of the third month), included functional, 
fear of falling, and quality of life measurements. Results The McHeELP 
intervention was very feasible and acceptable to the participants, and the 
adherence was excellent (100%). The majority of outcome measures seemed 
appropriate and significant differences were also revealed between the two 
groups. Specifically, post-intervention statistically significant improvement 
was found in the 4 meters walking test, Timed Up and Go test, Sit to Stand test, 
Tandem Stance test, Functional Reach test, Foot tapping test, EuroQoL-5D-5L - 
visual analog scale (VAS), Lower Extremity Functional Scale, Falls Self-Efficacy 
International Scale, and Home Falls and Accidents Screening Tool (HOMEFAST) 
questionnaire of McHeELP-G (all p-values ≤0.002). No statistically significant 
difference was observed in the mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort subscales of Euro QoL-5D-5L (all p-values >0.05), except the 
anxiety/depression subscale of McHeELP-G (p=0.008). Moreover, no statistically 
significant improvement was found regarding McHeELP participants' knee 
flexion/extension restriction and ankle dorsiflexion/plantar-flexion 
restrictions. Regarding CG, no statistically significant difference was found 
(p>0.05), except the Tandem Stance test (p=0.003) and HOMEFAST (p<0.001). 
Referring to the future McHeELP RCT, it was estimated that a sample size of 25 
evaluable patients per group is required. Conclusions This pilot trial's 
findings suggest that it is feasible to deliver an RCT of the McHeLP program to 
this population. Exercise programs that are easy to administer need to be 
developed and implemented to reduce the burden of falls in older adults.

Narrative review of: risk stratification and implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in adults with congenital heart disease.

Fortunately, the population of adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) is 
growing due to improved operation techniques. Life expectancy is continuously 
rising, nevertheless, sudden cardiac death is one of the leading causes of 
mortality in ACHD late after initial diagnosis. Risk stratification in ACHD 
remains challenging as large study results are missing, congenital defects and 
operation methods differ considerably between individual patients and results 
from acquired heart diseases are often not conferrable. The purpose of this 
narrative review is to objectively summarize the current knowledge on 
arrhythmogenic risk of ACHD and to give an overview on implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in this collective. Remarkable progress 
has been made in electrophysiological understanding of critical areas of slow 
conduction especially in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF). In patients 
with transposition of the great arteries after atrial baffling (Mustard/Senning 
procedure) atrial arrhythmias play a crucial role in sudden cardiac death. ICD 
therapy in ACHD may pose special technical challenges due to limited access for 
intracardiac leads. The introduction of the totally subcutaneous ICD improved 
therapeutic options for ACHD especially when contraindications for transvenous 
leads are present. Risk stratification in ACHD has to be seen as a team 
approach, requires thorough understanding of congenital heart defects and the 
operation techniques and needs unconventional technical approaches in some 
cases.

The main goal of this article is to demonstrate the impact of environmental and 
socio-economic factors on the spreading of COVID-19. In this research, data has 
been collected from 70 cities/provinces of different countries around the world 
that are affected by COVID-19. In this research, environmental data such as 
temperatures, humidity, air quality and population density and socio-economic 
data such as GDP (PPP) per capita, per capita health expenditure, life 
expectancy and total test in each of these cities/provinces are considered. This 
data has been analyzed using statistical models such as Poisson and negative 
binomial models. It is found that a negative binomial regression model is the 
best fit for our data. Our results reveal higher population density to be an 
important factor for the quick spread of COVID-19 as maintenance of social 
distancing requirements are more difficult in urban areas. Moreover, GDP (PPP) 
and PM2.5 are linked with fewer cases of COVID-19 whereas PM10, and total number 
of tests are strongly associated with the increase of COVID-19 case counts.

PURPOSE: To evaluate nodule management guidelines in a simulated cohort of Lung 
Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) 4 nodules based on real-world data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 100 000 patients were 
simulated from 151 patients with Lung-RADS 4 nodules (from January 2010 to 
August 2018). Each patient in the simulation was managed with each algorithm, 
and health outcomes were accumulated based on interventions and delays to cancer 
diagnosis. If the algorithm missed a cancer, it was diagnosed at the next annual 
screening round, although it would grow in the interim. Patient age-specific or 
cancer-specific mortality was assigned depending on whether the nodule was 
malignant, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated. Costs of 
interventions and cancer treatment were accumulated. One-way sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The most effective algorithm was the British Thoracic Society (BTS; 
10.041 QALYs), followed by the American College of Chest Physicians (10.035 
QALYs) and Lung-RADS (10.021 QALYs). Only the BTS and Lung-RADS were on the 
efficient frontier, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$52 634 (95% CI: $45 122, $60 619). Under nearly all sensitivity analyses, the 
only algorithms on the efficient frontier were BTS and Lung-RADS. The ICERs for 
BTS versus Lung-RADS were under $100 000 for all scenarios except an increased 
life expectancy in patients without cancer, in which case the ICER was $109 273.
CONCLUSION: The BTS algorithm and Lung-RADS were cost-effective for managing 
category 4 nodules, with BTS yielding greater QALYs.Supplemental material is

This functional joint model paper is motivated by a chronic kidney disease study 
post kidney transplantation. The available kidney organ is a scarce resource 
because millions of end-stage renal patients are on the waiting list for kidney 
transplantation. The life of the transplanted kidney can be extended if the 
progression of the chronic kidney disease stage can be slowed, and so a major 
research question is how to extend the transplanted kidney life to maximize the 
usage of the scarce organ resource. The glomerular filtration rate is the best 
test to monitor the progression of the kidney function, and it is a continuous 
longitudinal outcome with repeated measures. The patient's survival status is 
characterized by time-to-event outcomes including kidney transplant failure, 
death with kidney function, and death without kidney function. Few studies have 
been carried out to simultaneously investigate these multiple clinical outcomes 
in chronic kidney disease stage patients based on a joint model. Therefore, this 
paper proposes a new functional joint model from this clinical chronic kidney 
disease study. The proposed joint models include a longitudinal sub-model with a
