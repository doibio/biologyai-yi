An understanding of the main causes of mortality among captive gorillas is 
imperative to promoting their optimal care, health, and welfare. A retrospective 
observational review of mortality among the European zoo-housed western lowland 
gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla gorilla) population from 2004 to 2014 was carried out. 
This is the first published study of mortality in this population. Relevant 
postmortem data were requested from each collection reporting a death during the 
study period. Age at death enabled grouping into discrete age categories. Deaths 
were classified according to cause. The main causes of death overall and for 
each age category and sex were identified. In total, 151 gorillas from 50 
European collections died during the study period. Postmortem data were 
available for 119 (79%) of the deaths, of which 102 (86%) were classified by 
cause. Diseases of the digestive system were responsible for most (23%) deaths 
overall. Also of significance (each accounting for 15% overall mortality) were 
deaths due to external causes (especially trauma) among young gorillas and 
cardiovascular disease among adult and aged animals. Being a male gorilla was 
associated with an 8.77- and 5.40-fold increase in risk of death due to 
cardiovascular and respiratory disease, respectively. Death due to external 
causes was 4.45 times more likely among females than males. There was no 
statistically significant difference in life expectancy between male and female 
gorillas. The authors conclude that further work is needed to understand risk 
factors involved in the main causes of death and suggest a need for 
standardization with regard the approach to postmortem examination and data 
collection, sample collection, and storage across European zoos.

Although currently moderate and high intensity concurrent physical exercise is 
prescribed in populations with special needs due to its greater effect on 
physical condition and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), there are no data 
in the liver transplantation (LT) setting. The aim of this study is to evaluate 
changes in maximal strength, aerobic capacity, body composition, liver function, 
and HRQOL in LT patients after a moderate-to-high intensity combined 
resistance-endurance training. Six months after LT, 54 patients were randomized 
into 2 groups: intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). A total of 50 
patients completed the study with repeat testing at 6 and 12 months after LT. 
The IG completed a 6-month exercise training program, consisting of exercising 2 
days for 24 weeks in the hospital facilities, whereas the CG followed usual care 
recommendations. Patients completed a 5-multijoint exercise circuit with elastic 
bands involving the major muscle groups. The effects of the concurrent training 
program on maximal oxygen consumption, overall and regional maximal strength, 
body composition, liver function, and HRQOL were analyzed. The IG showed a 
significant improvement (P < 0.05) in outcome measurements compared with the CG 
in aerobic capacity, hip extension, elbow flexion, overall maximal strength, 
physical functioning, and vitality of HRQOL, whereas no changes were observed in 
body composition and liver function tests. In conclusion, this is the first 
study that combines supervised resistance and aerobic training performed at 
moderate-to-high intensity in LT recipients. It results in significant 
improvements in aerobic capacity, maximal strength, and HRQOL. Liver

Expectancy.

Purpose The benefits of annual surveillance mammography in older breast cancer 
survivors with limited life expectancy are not known, and there are important 
risks; however, little is known about mammography use among these women. 
Materials and Methods We used National Health Interview Study data from 2000, 
2005, 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2015 to examine surveillance mammography use among 
women age ≥ 65 years who reported a history of breast cancer. Using 
multivariable logistic regression, we assessed the probability of mammography 
within the last 12 months by 5- and 10-year life expectancy (using the validated 
Schonberg index), adjusting for survey year, region, age, marital status, 
insurance, educational attainment, and indicators of access to care. Results Of 
1,040 respondents, 33.7% were age ≥ 80 years and 88.6% were white. Approximately 
8.6% and 35.1% had an estimated life expectancy of ≤ 5 and ≤ 10 years, 
respectively. Overall, 78.9% reported having routine surveillance mammography in 
the last 12 months. Receipt of mammography decreased with decreasing life 
expectancy ( P < .001), although 56.7% and 65.9% of those with estimated ≤ 
5-year and ≤ 10-year life expectancy, respectively, reported mammography in the 
last year. Conversely, 14.1% of those with life expectancy > 10 years did not 
report mammography. In adjusted analyses, lower ( v higher) life expectancy was 
significantly associated with lower odds of mammography (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% 
CI, 0.3 to 0.8 for ≤ 5-year life expectancy and OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.6 for 
≤ 10-year life expectancy). Conclusion Many (57%) older breast cancer survivors 
with an estimated short life expectancy (< 5 years) receive annual surveillance 
mammography despite unknown benefits, whereas 14% with estimated life expectancy 
> 10 years did not report mammography. Practice guidelines are needed to 
optimize and tailor follow-up care for older patients.

Missed Opportunities: Adapting the HIV Care Continuum to Reduce HIV-Related 
Deaths.

INTRODUCTION: With advances in HIV care, persons with HIV/AIDS (PWHA) can lead 
healthy lives, but avoidable HIV-related deaths continue to occur in New York 
City (NYC).
METHODS: We selected PWHA from our surveillance registry who died between 2007 
and 2013, resided in NYC, and survived ≥15 months after diagnosis to generate an 
HIV Mortality Reduction Continuum of Care (HMRCC) describing predeath care 
patterns among PWHA. We used HIV laboratory test reports to measure care 
outcomes during an "intervenable period" during which deaths may have been 
avoided. The continuum was stratified by the underlying cause of death 
(HIV-related vs. other), and the HIV-related HMRCC was stratified by demographic 
characteristics.
RESULTS: Eleven thousand one hundred eighty-seven analysis-eligible PWHA died 
during 2007-2013. Ninety-eight percent linked to care; 80% were retained in care 
during the intervenable period; 66% were prescribed antiretroviral therapy; 47% 
had viral load ≤1500 copies/mL; and 40% achieved viral suppression (VS). Half 
(47%) of the deaths were HIV-related. Retention was higher among HIV-related 
cause of death (83% vs. 78%) but VS was lower (34% vs. 46%). The HIV-related 
HMRCC revealed disparities in VS. Despite comparable retention rates, whites had 
the highest VS (42%, vs. 32% blacks and 33% Latinos/Hispanics). In addition, 
retention and VS increased with increasing age. People with a history of 
injection drug use had relatively high rates of retention (88%) and VS (37%).
DISCUSSION: The HMRCC is a novel framework for evaluating predeath care patterns 
among PWHA and identifying opportunities to reduce preventable deaths. In NYC, 
reducing mortality will require increasing VS among those already in care, 
particularly for blacks and Latinos/Hispanics.

BACKGROUND: Early initiation of antiviral therapy in elderly patients with 
influenza is associated with reduced risk of extra clinic visit, hospitalization 
and death. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of molecular POCT for 
detection of influenza viruses in Hong Kong elderly patients with influenza-like 
illness (ILI) in the outpatient clinics.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to simulate outcomes of a 
hypothetical cohort of elderly patients presented with ILI at outpatient clinics 
during peak season of influenza with two diagnostic approaches: Rapid molecular 
assay (POCT-PCR group) and clinical judgement with no POCT. Outcome measures 
included influenza-associated direct medical cost, hospitalization and mortality 
rates, quality-adjusted life year loss (QALY loss), and incremental cost per 
QALY saved (ICER).
RESULTS: In base-case analysis, POCT-PCR group was expected to reduce 
hospitalization (1.38% versus 2.85%) and mortality rate (0.08% versus 0.16%) and 
save 0.00112 QALYs at higher cost (by USD33.2 per ILI patient), comparing with 
clinical judgement group. The ICER of POCT-PCR was 29,582 USD/QALY saved. 
One-way sensitivity analyses found ICER sensitive to: Hospitalization rate 
without prompt antiviral therapy; odds ratio of hospitalization with prompt 
therapy; influenza prevalence; patient age and mortality rate of hospitalized 
patients. POCT-PCR was cost-effective in 60.6% and 99.4% of 10,000 Monte Carlo 
simulations at willingness-to-pay threshold of 1x and 3x gross domestic product 
per capita of Hong Kong, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular POCT for influenza detection in elderly patients with ILI 
at outpatient clinics during peak influenza season appeared to be cost-effective 
in Hong Kong.

BACKGROUND: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) or CD18 deficiency is an 
autosomal recessive immunodeficiency which has been described in people, cattle, 
dogs, and knockout mice.
OBJECTIVES: The study goals were to characterize the clinicopathologic, 
immunologic, and molecular genetic features of feline LAD (FLAD) in a neutered 
male adult Domestic Longhair cat with severe leukocytosis and recurrent 
infections.
METHODS: Flow cytometry evaluated surface expression of CD18 on neutrophils. In 
vitro functional assays assessed CD18-dependent neutrophil adhesion and T-cell 
proliferation. Genomic DNA and cDNA were used to identify a causative mutation 
in the coding sequence of the integrin β2 subunit (ITGB2) gene.
RESULTS: The affected cat developed periodontitis during the first months of 
life followed by recurrent infections poorly responsive to antibiotic therapy, 
accompanied by extreme neutrophilia. Neutrophils from the proband, compared to 
feline controls, did not express any CD18 on the cell surface. Adhesion of 
affected neutrophils was severely impaired with and without 
phorbol-myristate-acetate activation. The proband's T-cells proliferated weakly 
to 1 pg but normally to 100 pg staphylococcal enterotoxin A, suggesting a 
CD18-independent T-cell response at higher doses. Molecular genetic analysis of 
the ITGB2 gene revealed a 24 bp deletion at the exon 2 to intron 2 boundary 
(c.46_58 + 11del), predicting premature translational termination due to 
abnormal splicing of exon 1 to exon 3 or 4.
CONCLUSIONS: Feline LAD exhibits features similar to LAD in other species. 
However, clinical episodes in FLAD appeared milder allowing for an extended life 
expectancy under long-term antimicrobial therapy, possibly due to an 
alternative, CD18-independent T-cell proliferation pathway.

A case study utilizing myofascial release, acupressure and trigger point therapy 
to treat bilateral "Stringhalt" in a 12 year old Akhal-Teke horse.

"Stringhalt" is a horse condition that causes one or both hind legs to spasm 
when walking, trotting or backing. The condition is thought to be related to a 
neurological cause from either plant toxicity or peripheral nerve injury. The 
prognosis is poor and the horse's performance and quality of life can be 
affected. Treatment has included surgically cutting the digital extensors with 
varied results. The objective of the study is to utilize soft tissue release via 
acupressure, trigger point and myofascial release to decrease symptoms of 
stringhalt. The case study is a 12 year old Akhal-Teke horse of excellent 
pedigree. In 2011, she was caught in barbed wire overnight and sustained 
lacerations to the bone in her hindlimbs. Shortly after the injury the horse was 
placed in a stall for several months and was unable to walk or run, developing 
stringhalt. Currently, her condition is aggravated by stress and alleviated by 
certain types of massage (myofascial, acupressure, and trigger point release). 
The incidence of stringhalt occurs every 3-5 min, with more frequent and severe 
symptoms on the right hindlimb. The horse is unable to run or back up. Six 1 to 
1½ hour bi-weekly treatments were performed. The treatments consisted of 
myofascial release at the cervical, sacrum and iliums, acupressure of the 
bladder meridian (including c-spine, t-spine, l-spine, and hamstring), and 
trigger point release of the iliacus. The stringhalt symptoms were monitored for 
30 min prior to each of the 6 treatment sessions. After 6 treatments, the horse 
was observed running and standing in a position that promotes hip extension. She 
has not been able to do either since the injury. The frequency and severity of 
the spasms have decreased to every 10-20 min. The horse's owners report that her 
disposition, stress and quality of life are much improved. The results suggest 
that myofascial release, acupressure and trigger point therapy may be utilized 
to provide a positive treatment outcome in the case of stringhalt. However, 
please note that the scope of practice varies by state and special training is 
needed to work with the equine population.

Trends in inequality in length of life in India: a decomposition analysis by age 
and causes of death.

BACKGROUND: Studies dealing with trends in inequality in length of life in India 
are rare. Studies documenting the contribution of age and causes of death to the 
inequality in length of life are more limited.
OBJECTIVE: The study aims to examine the trends in inequality in length of life 
in India and 15 major states of India and to decompose the inequality in length 
of life into the contributions of age and causes of death.
METHOD: We use life table Gini coefficient (G0) to measure the inequality in 
length of life. We use the formulae developed by Shkolnikov, Andreev, and Begun 
(DR 8(11):305-358, 2003) to decompose the differences between Gini coefficients 
by age and cause of death.
RESULT: The G0 for men has declined from 0.32 in 1981 to 0.19 in 2011. For 
women, G0 has decreased from 0.31 in 1981 to 0.22 in 2011. Mortality decline in 
the age group 0-1 year has contributed most to the decrease in G0. In contrast, 
mortality decline in 60+ has tended to increase the G0. The state-wide 
variations in the age-specific contributions to decrease in G0 were stark. The 
contribution of noncommunicable diseases to the male-female gap in G0 has 
increased between 1990 and 2010. Injuries at ages from 20 to 39 years also 
contributed to the male-female difference in G0 in 2010.
CONCLUSION: Future studies must analyze inequality in life expectancy for 
assessing the performance of societies regarding length of life.
CONTRIBUTION: This is the first study that provides compelling evidence on 
inequality in length of life in India and its major states.

An Approach to the Estimation of Chronic Air Pollution Effects Using 
Spatio-Temporal Information.

There is substantial observational evidence that long-term exposure to 
particulate air pollution is associated with premature death in urban 
populations. Estimates of the magnitude of these effects derive largely from 
cross-sectional comparisons of adjusted mortality rates among cities with 
varying pollution levels. Such estimates are potentially confounded by other 
differences among the populations correlated with air pollution, for example, 
socioeconomic factors. An alternative approach is to study covariation of 
particulate matter and mortality across time within a city, as has been done in 
investigations of short-term exposures. In either event, observational studies 
like these are subject to confounding by unmeasured variables. Therefore the 
ability to detect such confounding and to derive estimates less affected by 
confounding are a high priority. In this article, we describe and apply a method 
of decomposing the exposure variable into components with variation at distinct 
temporal, spatial, and time by space scales, here focusing on the components 
involving time. Starting from a proportional hazard model, we derive a Poisson 
regression model and estimate two regression coefficients: the "global" 
coefficient that measures the association between national trends in pollution 
and mortality; and the "local" coefficient, derived from space by time 
variation, that measures the association between location-specific trends in 
pollution and mortality adjusted by the national trends. Absent unmeasured 
confounders and given valid model assumptions, the scale-specific coefficients 
should be similar; substantial differences in these coefficients constitute a 
basis for questioning the model. We derive a backfitting algorithm to fit our 
model to very large spatio-temporal datasets. We apply our methods to the 
Medicare Cohort Air Pollution Study (MCAPS), which includes individual-level 
information on time of death and age on a population of 18.2 million for the 
period 2000-2006. Results based on the global coefficient indicate a large 
increase in the national life expectancy for reductions in the yearly national 
average of PM2.5. However, this coefficient based on national trends in PM2.5 
and mortality is likely to be confounded by other variables trending on the 
national level. Confounding of the local coefficient by unmeasured factors is 
less likely, although it cannot be ruled out. Based on the local coefficient 
alone, we are not able to demonstrate any change in life expectancy for a 
reduction in PM2.5. We use additional survey data available for a subset of the 
data to investigate sensitivity of results to the inclusion of additional 
covariates, but both coefficients remain largely unchanged.

Aortic stenosis is one of the most frequent valvular diseases in developed 
countries, and its impact on public health resources and assistance is 
increasing. A substantial proportion of elderly people with severe aortic 
stenosis is not eligible to surgery because of the advanced age, frailty, and 
multiple co-morbidities. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) enables 
the treatment of very elderly patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk 
considered ineligible for surgery and with an acceptable life expectancy. 
However, a significant percentage of patients die or show no improvement in 
quality of life (QOL) in the follow-up. In the decision-making process, it is 
important to determine: (i) whether and how much frailty of the patient 
influences the risk of procedures; (ii) how the QOL and the individual patient's 
survival are influenced by aortic valve disease or from other associated 
conditions; and (iii) whether a geriatric specialist intervention to evaluate 
and correct frailty or other diseases with their potential or already manifest 
disabilities can improve the outcome of surgery or TAVI. Consequently, in 
addition to risk stratification with conventional tools, a number of factors 
including multi-morbidity, disability, frailty, and cognitive function should be 
considered, in order to assess the expected benefit of both surgery and TAVI. 
The pre-operative optimization through a multidisciplinary approach with a Heart 
Team can counteract the multiple damage (cardiac, neurological, muscular, 
respiratory, and kidney) that can potentially aggravate the reduced 
physiological reserves characteristic of frailty. The systematic application in 
clinical practice of multidimensional assessment instruments of frailty and 
cognitive function in the screening and the adoption of specific care pathways 
should facilitate this task.

AIM: We conducted a matched-cohort study to assess mortality in schizophrenia 
and the relationship of mortality with comorbid somatic conditions and suicide 
attempts.
METHOD: A full-population register-based prospective matched-cohort study was 
performed including all eligible patients with schizophrenia in Hungary between 
01/01/2005 and 31/12/2013. Control subjects were individually matched to 
patients with schizophrenia at a 5:1 ratio. The principal outcome measure was 
death due to any reason. A non-parametric approach was used for descriptive 
statistical purposes, the Kaplan-Meier model for survival analysis, and the Cox 
proportional-hazards regression model for inferential statistics.
RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia (n=65,169) had substantially higher risk of 
all-cause mortality than the control subjects (n=325,435) (RR=2.4; P<0.0001). 
Comorbidities and suicide attempts were associated with significantly increased 
mortality in both groups. As compared to the controls, 20-year old males with 
schizophrenia had a shorter life expectancy by 11.5years, and females by 
13.7years; the analogous numbers for 45-year old schizophrenics were 8.1 and 
9.6years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant mortality gap - mainly associated with somatic 
comorbidities - was detected between patients with schizophrenia and 
individually matched controls. Improved medical training to address the 
disparity in mortality, and many other factors including lack of resources, 
access to and model of medical care, lifestyle, medication side effects, 
smoking, stigma, need for early intervention and adequate health care 
organization could help to better address the physical health needs of patients 
with schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND: The use of primary androgen deprivation therapy (PADT) is common in 
elderly men with early-stage prostate cancer (PCa), despite the absence of 
guideline recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: To examine survival patterns of octo- and nonagenarian men with 
organ-confined PCa exposed to PADT, to assess whether their life expectancy 
warrants androgen deprivation therapy use.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results-Medicare-linked database, we identified 14 785 octo- and nonagenarian 
organ-confined PCa patients treated with PADT between 1991 and 2009.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The smoothed cumulative incidence 
method was used to examine 10-yr overall mortality, cancer-specific mortality 
(CSM), and other-cause mortality (OCM) rates. Multivariable Cox regression 
analyses focused on the combined effect of age and Charlson comorbidity index 
(CCI) after adjusting for different confounders.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of all the deaths observed during the study period, 80% 
were due to non-cancer causes and 20% were due to PCa. The 10-yr overall 
survival (OS) rate in the overall population was 15.4%. The 10-yr OS rates 
ranged from 19.9% in patients aged 80-84 yr to 3.1% in those aged ≥90 yr. 
Similarly, the 10-yr OS rates ranged from 18.7% in patients with CCI=0 to 11.5% 
in those with CCI≥2. The 10-yr OCM rate in the overall population was 68.2%. The 
10-yr OCM rates ranged from 64.6% in patients aged 80-84 yr to 77.2% in patients 
aged ≥90 yr. Similarly, the 10-yr OCM rates ranged from 62.1% in patients with 
CCI=0 to 75.2% in those with CCI≥2. The 10-yr CSM rate in the overall population 
was 16.4%. The 10-yr CSM rates ranged from 15.5% in patients aged 80-84 yr to 
19.7% in those aged ≥90 yr, and from 19.2% in patients with CCI=0 to 13.3% in 
those with CCI≥2.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the elderly patients with organ-confined PCa exposed to PADT, 
only 15% survive at 10-yr follow-up. Mortality related to non-cancer causes is 
the leading cause of death in the same follow-up period. These figures question 
the rationale for PADT in elderly men with organ-confined PCa.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study, we looked at the survival patterns of octo- and 
nonagenarians treated with primary androgen deprivation therapy for 
organ-confined prostate cancer. We found that a small proportion of patients who 
received primary androgen deprivation therapy remain alive at 10-yr follow-up, 
and the leading cause of death was not attributable to prostate cancer.

The study aims to determine the spatial and temporal variation of a longevous 
region and explore the correlation between longevity and socioeconomic 
development. Population data at the township level were obtained from the last 
four population censuses (1982-2010). Five main lifespan indicators and the 
Human Development Index (HDI) were calculated. Getis-Ord G*, Gravity modeling, 
and Pearson's r between lifespan indicators and HDI were applied. In this study, 
a stable longevous gathering area was discovered in Hechi during different 
periods. Under the influence of social and economic development, more longevous 
areas appeared. However, the effects of genetic and natural environmental 
factors on longevity were always dominant in this remote and mountainous city. 
Furthermore, longevity indicators lacked any significant correlation with life 
expectancy. No significant positive correlation was detected between lifespan 
indicators and HDI. Thus, we conclude that lifespan indicators can determine the 
spatial distribution and variation pattern of longevity from multiple 
dimensions. The geographical scope of longevity in Hechi City is gradually 
expanding, and significant spatial clustering was detected in southwestern, 
southern, and eastern parts of Hechi. This study also found that social economic 
development is likely to have a certain impact on new longevous areas, but their 
role on extreme longevity is not significant.

Complex decision making in patients with dementia in an internal medicine 
department.

Republic. ladislav.kabelka.mobilni@gmail.com.

With the increase of polymorbidity, extending life expectancy and improving 
treatment options for chronic diseases, the care for dementia is moving into 
other areas of medicine. The length and quality of life with advanced dementia 
is directly dependent on the quality of medical and nursing care, early 
detection and treatment of complications, nutritional support and palliative 
care plan. Significant is also the support for family carers. The key 
coordinators of care for patients with dementia are general practitioners (GPs), 
geriatricians, psychiatrists, and an increasingly important role play 
internists. Case reports of patients admitted to an internal medicine 
department. Description of clinical experiences with caring on patients with 
dementia. In the internal departments of regional hospitals, there is a room for 
adjustment of the care plan, for comprehensive assessment of the patient and for 
making crucial decisions regarding nutrition, treatment of chronic diseases, 
consideration of previously expressed wishes in the context of the patient 
condition, and potential prognostic indicators. This assessment must result in a 
comprehensive documentation and communication with patients, and in the case of 
advanced dementia with their family members. The general internal medicine is 
very often the first place where the patient has a chance to hear about 
indication for palliative care. Without the availability of a multidisciplinary 
assessment, good communication and documentation, it is unrealistic to expect 
that the hospital would provide comprehensive care for patients with dementia.

AIMS: The link between deformational plagiocephaly and psychomotor development 
is a recurrent question in medical publications. Main publications concentrate 
on term infants, but there is a lack of data on the impact of deformational 
plagiocephaly on the long-term neurodevelopment of premature infants. We 
attempted to establish a possible relation between deformational plagiocephaly 
during the 1st year of life and the psychomotor score at 4 years in prematurely 
born infants. Other risk factors potentially impacting the psychomotor score 
were also studied.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of the files of the children 
followed by the "Naître et Devenir Région PACA Ouest Corse Sud" healthcare 
network and included in the database allowed us to select a cohort of 
594 infants born prematurely at under 33 weeks of gestational age. These 
children were developmentally evaluated during the 1st year of life and at 
4 years or age using the "EVAL Mater" test. The "Naître et Devenir" network is 
following up infants born prematurely at under 33 weeks of gestation in the West 
Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur and South Corsica region, from discharge to 7 years. 
A group of 170 specially trained pediatricians follow these infants 
developmentally at term, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months of corrected age and 3, 
4 5, 6, and 7 years. Data are collected in a specially designed database.
RESULTS: There was no significant link between deformational plagiocephaly 
during the 1st year of life and a pathological psychomotor score at age 4, but 
some risk factors were demonstrated: male gender, birth at under 28 weeks of 
gestational age, weight at birth under 1000g, having a Latal and Ferriero 
neuromotor score equal to or greater than 2 at 3 months of corrected age, and to 
a lesser extent having a prescription for physiotherapy during the 1st year.
CONCLUSION: The research on deformational plagiocephaly in the full-term infant 
suggests a relation between deformational plagiocephaly and developmental delay 
predominantly on the motor side, with an increased rate of special needs 
services at school age. The question is raised of whether deformational 
plagiocephaly is the cause of the delay or an early sign of cerebral anomaly 
with an early motor delay in full-term infants. The results suggest that 
deformational plagiocephaly in the prematurely born infant may not be related to 
neurodevelopmental delay but simply to the extended time spent in the supine 
position because of the early birth associated with physiological hypotonia and 
axial extension. Other risk factors such as male gender, birth before 28 weeks 
of gestation, weight less than 1000g, a Latal and Ferriero neuromotor score 
greater than 2 at 3 months of corrected age, and having a prescription for 
physiotherapy during the 1st year of life are strongly related to delayed 
psychomotor development at age 4.

BACKGROUND: Conditional survival is the life expectancy from a point in time for 
a patient who has survived a specific period after presentation. The aim of the 
study was to estimate conditional survival for patients with unresectable 
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.
METHODS: Patients with unresectable perihilar cholangiocarcinoma from two 
academic hospitals in the Netherlands between 2002 and 2012 were assessed. A 
multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to identify risk 
factors associated with overall survival. Survival was estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method to evaluate factors associated with overall survival.
RESULTS: In total, 572 patients were included. Overall survival was 42% at one 
year and 6% at three years. The conditional chance of surviving three years was 
15% at 1 year and increased to 38% at 2 years. Independent poor prognostic 
factors for overall survival were age ≥65 years, tumor size >3 cm on imaging, 
bilirubin levels (>250 μmol/L), CA19-9 level at presentation (>1000 U/ml), and 
suspected distant metastases on imaging. The conditional survival of patients 
with and without these prognostic factors was comparable after patients survived 
the first two or more years.
CONCLUSION: The conditional chance of surviving for patients with unresectable 
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma increases with time. Poor prognostic factors become 
less relevant once patients have survived two years.

BACKGROUND: Heavy menstrual bleeding affects up to one third of women in the 
United States, resulting in a reduced quality of life and significant cost to 
the health care system. Multiple treatment options exist, offering different 
potential for symptom control at highly variable initial costs, but the relative 
value of these treatment options is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the relative 
cost-effectiveness of 4 treatment options for heavy menstrual bleeding: 
hysterectomy, resectoscopic endometrial ablation, nonresectoscopic endometrial 
ablation, and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system.
STUDY DESIGN: We formulated a decision tree evaluating private payer costs and 
quality-adjusted life years over a 5 year time horizon for premenopausal women 
with heavy menstrual bleeding and no suspected malignancy. For each treatment 
option, we used probabilities derived from literature review to estimate 
frequencies of minor complications, major complications, and treatment failure 
resulting in the need for additional treatments. Treatments were compared in 
terms of total average costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to 
understand the range of possible outcomes if model inputs were varied.
RESULTS: The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system had superior 
quality-of-life outcomes to hysterectomy with lower costs. In a probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system was 
cost-effective compared with hysterectomy in the majority of scenarios (90%). 
Both resectoscopic and nonresectoscopic endometrial ablation were associated 
with reduced costs compared with hysterectomy but resulted in a lower average 
quality of life. According to standard willingness-to-pay thresholds, 
resectoscopic endometrial ablation was considered cost effective compared with 
hysterectomy in 44% of scenarios, and nonresectoscopic endometrial ablation was 
considered cost effective compared with hysterectomy in 53% of scenarios.
CONCLUSION: Comparing all trade-offs associated with 4 possible treatments of 
heavy menstrual bleeding, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system was 
superior to both hysterectomy and endometrial ablation in terms of cost and 
quality of life. Hysterectomy is associated with a superior quality of life and 
fewer complications than either type of ablation but at a higher cost. For women 
who are unwilling or unable to choose the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine 
system as a first-course treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding, consideration 
of cost, procedure-specific complications, and patient preferences can guide the 
decision between hysterectomy and ablation.

PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and safety of panzyga® (intravenous 
immunoglobulin 10%) in preventing serious bacterial infections (SBIs) in 
patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs), a prospective, 
open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study and an open-label extension study were 
undertaken.
METHODS: Initially, the study drug (infusion rate ≤0.08 mL/kg/min) was 
administered at intervals of 3 or 4 weeks for 12 months, followed by 3 months of 
panzyga® at infusion rates increasing from 0.08 to 0.14 mL/kg/min. The primary 
endpoint in the main study was the rate of SBIs per patient-year on treatment. 
Secondary outcomes included non-serious infections, work/school absence, 
episodes of fever, quality of life, and adverse events (AEs).
RESULTS: The main study enrolled 51 patients (35% female, mean age 26.8 years), 
with 21 participating in the extension study. The rate of SBIs per patient-year 
was 0.08 in the total population; there were four SBIs in the 4-weekly treatment 
group (2/30 patients) and none in the 3-weekly group (n = 21). Compared with 
4-weekly treatment, 3-weekly treatment was associated with a higher rate of 
upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs), ear infections, and work/school 
absences, but a lower rate of lower RTIs and fever. Treatment was generally well 
tolerated; no AE led to treatment withdrawal or death.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the use of panzyga® in patients with antibody-deficient 
PID was associated with a low rate of AEs and was effective in preventing SBIs, 
exceeding US FDA and European Medicines Agency recommendations for efficacy.

However, due to treatment with NTBC, tyrosine concentrations greatly increase. 
As a consequence to possible neurocognitive problems, the main objective of 
dietary therapy in HT1 is to provide adequate nutrition allowing normal growth 
and development while strictly controlling tyrosine levels in blood (and 
tissues). Although no well-defined target levels exist, tyrosine concentrations 
below 400 μmol/L are considered to be safe. To achieve this aim a diet 
restricted in natural protein and supplemented with a special tyrosine and 
phenylalanine-free amino acid mixture is necessary.Dietary management could be 
strenuous at diagnosis due to several different problems. If vomiting and 
diarrhea are a major issue at diagnosis, frequent feeding with additional energy 
from low protein food is needed for catch-up growth. Initiation of dietary 
treatment is usually easier if diagnosis is directly after birth. Based on 
newborn screening when infants are still reasonable healthy. If presenting 
clinically infants may experience serious difficulties in taking the amino acid
