Due to increasing reports on poor-quality palm oil in the market, there has been 
a continual decrease in demand and revenue cum product rejection of palm oil 
sold in Jos, Nigeria. Hence, the significance of this work aims to moderate the 
microbial and physical qualities of crude palm oil sold in different major 
markets in order to increase revenue through quality control and quality 
assurance protocols. The intent is to create awareness among government 
monitoring agencies, buyers (exporters and importers), and to promote standard 
processing procedures among manufacturers. The study was carried out to 
ascertain the levels of mold contamination and physicochemical properties of 
crude palm oil sold in Jos and its environ. A total of 90 samples were collected 
in sterile containers. Molds were isolated and identified using standard 
identification procedures. The physicochemical properties: free fatty acids 
(FFA), peroxide value (PV), iodine value (IV), moisture content (MC), and 
impurity level were determined. The assessment of mold isolated from the study 
sites recognized some life-threatening genera capable of producing carcinogenic 
toxins. Candida sp. (51%) had the highest percentage of occurrence followed by 
Aspergillus sp. (45%) while Fusarium sp. (3%) was the least occurring mold. The 
mean mold count for all the palm oil samples ranges from 3.18 × 104 
(cfu/mL)-4.56 × 104 (cfu/mL). Physicochemical findings showed that the average 
FFA (3.43-6.88%), PV (6.96-13.63 mEq/kg), IV (39.7-67.5 wijs), and MC 
(0.44-0.72%) values were within the SON acceptable limit, except the impurity 
level (0.28-0.44%) which was higher than the acceptable SON range in all the 
sites. There was a significant difference (P ≤ 0.05) in the mold and 
physicochemical properties of crude palm oil in almost all the samples analyzed 
when compared to both local and international permissible limits of the tested 
parameters recommended for edible palm oil. There was compliance between the 
permissible limits (local and international) of the physicochemical values of 
the parameters we tested for in the edible palm oil except the impurity level, 
while the mold count did not meet (was higher) with the required permissible 
limit of the SON mold count.

Model-based economic evaluation was performed to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of zoledronic acid. Although zoledronic acid was dominated by alendronate, the 
incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was quite small in extent. 
Considering the advantage of once-yearly injection of zoledronic acid in 
persistence, zoledronic acid might be a cost-effective treatment option compared 
to once-weekly oral alendronate.
INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of once-yearly injection of zoledronic acid for the treatment of osteoporosis in 
Japan.
METHODS: A patient-level state-transition model was developed to predict the 
outcome of patients with osteoporosis who have experienced a previous vertebral 
fracture. The efficacy of zoledronic acid was derived from a published network 
meta-analysis. Lifetime cost and QALYs were estimated for patients who had 
received zoledronic acid, alendronate, or basic treatment alone. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of zoledronic acid was estimated.
RESULTS: For patients 70 years of age, zoledronic acid was dominated by 
alendronate with incremental QALY of -0.004 to -0.000 and incremental cost of 
430 USD to 493 USD. Deterministic sensitivity analysis indicated that the 
relative risk of hip fracture and drug cost strongly affected the 
cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid compared to alendronate. Scenario analysis 
considering treatment persistence showed that the ICER of zoledronic acid 
compared to alendronate was estimated to be 47,435 USD, 27,018 USD, and 10,749 
USD per QALY gained for patients with a T-score of -2.0, -2.5, or -3.0, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although zoledronic acid is dominated by alendronate, the 
incremental QALY is quite small in extent. Considering the advantage of annual 
zoledronic acid treatment in compliance and persistence, zoledronic acid may be 
a cost-effective treatment option compared to alendronate.

We assessed the health state utility value (HSUV) reductions associated with 
vertebral fractures using data collected in the Japanese Osteoporosis 
Intervention Trial-03 (JOINT-03). Our analysis revealed that assessment of HSUVs 
after morphometric vertebral fracture is important to capture the burden of 
vertebral fractures.
INTRODUCTION: Evaluation of the HSUV after fracture is important to calculate 
the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of osteoporosis patients, which is 
essential information in the context of health economic evaluation.
METHODS: JOINT-03 study patients were aged ≥65 years and treated with 
risedronate and vitamin K2 or risedronate alone. Radiographic information and 
patient-reported outcomes measured by EQ-5D and a visual analogue scale (VAS) 
were assessed at registration and followed up after 6, 12, and 24 months. 
According to differences among the dates of these assessments and the 
radiographic information, we classified the follow-up HSUVs calculated based on 
EQ-5D results into before or after fracture categories regardless of clinical 
symptoms.
RESULTS: Among 2922 follow-up HSUVs, 201 HSUVs were categorized as HSUVs that 
were observed after incident vertebral fractures on X-ray films. The median time 
from the detection of an incident vertebral fracture until the EQ-5D assessment 
was 53 days (25th percentile, 0 day; 75th percentile, 357 days). The impact of 
incident vertebral fractures on HSUVs was quantified as -0.03. Among the five 
health profile domains on the EQ-5D, an incident vertebral fracture had 
significant effects on anxiety/depression, self-care, and usual activities.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that incident morphometric vertebral fracture 
was associated with impairment of the HSUV for patients with osteoporosis not 
only immediately but also several months after the fracture.

The life history traits of blow fly Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius, 1775) was 
studied under semi-controlled laboratory conditions at 29.14°C temperature, 
72.53% relative humidity, and 12-h photoperiod. The raw data were analyzed based 
on the age-stage, two-sex life table, considering the development rates among 
individuals of both sexes. Cochliomyia macellaria survival rate was 0.43 (♂) and 
0.40 (♀), while life expectancy was 17.9 (♂) and 20.9 (♀) days, for adult males 
and females, respectively. The total fecundity was 681.15 eggs/female, with an 
average of 3.65 batches/female and 199 eggs/batch. The intrinsic rate of 
increase (r) was 0.327 days-1, the finite rate of population increase (λ) was 
3.35 days-1, the mean generation time (T) was 17.15 days, and the net 
reproduction rate (R 0 ) was 272.46 offspring/individual. The population 
parameters found here corroborates that C. macellaria population act as a r 
selected species under laboratory conditions. Additionally, development data and 
accumulated degree days (ADD) for each stage of C. macellaria are provided and 
its implications for the forensic use are discussed.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has 
increased the life expectancy of patients with HIV infection, allowing them to 
live longer with this chronic medical condition and consequently experiencing 
conditions such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Several studies have 
investigated the increased risk of CVD in people living with HIV (PLWH). 
However, less is known about the exact mechanisms involved in this increased 
risk. Also, specific guidelines for management of CVD in PLWH have not been 
developed yet. In this article, we review the recent literature on the 
mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of CVD in PLWH, with an emphasis on coronary 
artery disease (CAD).
RECENT FINDINGS: Although initial studies suspected the increased prevalence of 
traditional CVD risk factors and side effects of ART to be involved in the 
increased CVD risk in PLWH, recent studies have uncovered the important role of 
chronic persistent inflammation in this increased risk. In addition, biomarkers 
of inflammation have been associated with both CVD events and subclinical CAD in 
this population. Lastly, recent studies and ongoing clinical trials have been 
investigating medical interventions that aim to reduce inflammation and 
cardiovascular events. Different mechanisms of inflammation have been examined 
in PLWH, including subclinical viremia, microbial translocation, and coinfection 
with other pathogens such as cytomegalovirus. Although inflammatory biomarkers 
have been consistently associated with CVD and subclinical CVD outcomes, their 
prognostic value is unknown. Recent and ongoing trials are exploring the 
benefits of anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and antimicrobial translocation 
drugs on both inflammation and CVD risk among PLWH.

BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, progress in prevention and treatment of 
caries and periodontal diseases has been translated to better oral health and 
improved tooth retention in the adult population. The ageing population and the 
increasing expectations of good oral health-related quality of life in older age 
pose formidable challenges to clinical care and healthcare systems.
AIMS: The objective of this workshop was to critically review scientific 
evidence and develop specific recommendations to: (i) prevent tooth loss and 
retain oral function through prevention and treatment of caries and periodontal 
diseases later in life and (ii) increase awareness of the health benefits of 
oral health as an essential component of healthy ageing.
METHODS: Discussions were initiated by three systematic reviews covering aspects 
of epidemiology of caries and periodontal diseases in elders, the impact of 
senescence on caries and periodontal diseases and the effectiveness of 
interventions. Recommendations were developed based on evidence from the 
systematic reviews and expert opinion.
RESULTS: Key messages included: (i) the ageing population, trends in risk 
factors and improved tooth retention point towards an expected increase in the 
total burden of disease posed by caries and periodontal diseases in the older 
population; (ii) specific surveillance is required to monitor changes in oral 
health in the older population; (iii) senescence impacts oral health including 
periodontitis and possibly caries susceptibility; (iv) evidence indicates that 
caries and periodontal diseases can be prevented and treated also in older 
adults; (v) oral health and functional tooth retention later in life provides 
benefits both in terms of oral and general quality of life and in terms of 
preventing physical decline and dependency by fostering a healthy diet; (vi) 
oral healthcare professionals and individuals should not base decisions 
impacting tooth retention on chronological age but on level of dependency, life 
expectancy, frailty, comfort and quality of life; and (vii) health policy should 
remove barriers to oral health care for vulnerable elders.
CONCLUSIONS: Consensus was reached on specific actionable priorities for public 
health officials, oral healthcare professionals, educators and workforce 
planners, caregivers and relatives as well as for the public and ageing 
patients. Some priorities have major implications for policymakers as health 
systems need to adapt to the challenge by systemwide changes to enable (promote) 
tooth retention later in life and management of deteriorating oral health in 
increasingly dependent elders.

Iatrogenic Flatback and Flatback Syndrome: Evaluation, Management, and 
Prevention.

Flatback syndrome can be a significant source of disability, affecting stance 
and gait, and resulting in significant pain. Although the historical 
instrumentation options for thoracolumbar fusion procedures have been commonly 
regarded as the etiology of iatrogenic flatback, inappropriate selection, or 
application of modern instrumentation can similarly produce flatback 
deformities. Patients initially compensate with increased lordosis at adjacent 
lumbar segments and reduction of thoracic kyphosis. As paraspinal musculature 
fatigues and discs degenerate, maintaining sagittal balance requires increasing 
pelvic retroversion and hip extension. Ultimately, disc degeneration at adjacent 
levels overcomes compensatory mechanisms, resulting in sagittal imbalance and 
worsening symptoms. Nonoperative management for sagittally imbalanced (sagittal 
vertical axis>5 cm) flatback syndrome is frequently unsuccessful. Despite 
significant complication rates, surgical management to recreate lumbar lordosis 
using interbody fusions and/or osteotomies can significantly improve quality of 
life.

Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of liver resection followed by 
adjuvant systemic therapy relative to systemic therapy alone for patients with 
breast cancer liver metastasis.
BACKGROUND: Data on cost-effectiveness of liver resection for advanced breast 
cancer with liver metastasis are lacking.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of liver resection followed by postoperative conventional 
systemic therapy (strategy A) versus conventional therapy alone (strategy B) 
versus newer targeted therapy alone (strategy C). The implications of using 
different chemotherapeutic regimens based on estrogen receptor and human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status was also assessed. Outcomes included 
quality-adjusted life months (QALMs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and 
net health benefit (NHB).
RESULTS: NHB of strategy A was 10.9 QALMs compared with strategy B when 
letrozole was used as systemic therapy, whereas it was only 0.3 QALMs when 
docetaxel + trastuzumab was used as a systemic therapy. The addition of newer 
biological agents (strategy C) significantly decreased the cost-effectiveness of 
strategy B (conventional systemic therapy alone). The NHB of strategy A was 31.6 
QALMs versus strategy C when palbociclib was included in strategy C; similarly, 
strategy A had a NHB of 13.8 QALMs versus strategy C when pertuzumab was 
included in strategy C. Monte-Carlo simulation demonstrated that the main factor 
influencing NHB of strategy A over strategy C was the cost of systemic therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Liver resection in patients with breast cancer liver metastasis 
proved to be cost-effective when compared with systemic therapy alone, 
particularly in estrogen receptor-positive tumors or when newer agents were 
used.

Natural selection presumably conserved mechanisms that allow females to block or 
terminate gestation when environmental circumstances threaten the survival of 
offspring. One example of this adaptive reproductive suppression, the Bruce 
effect, has been identified in several species, both in the laboratory and in 
the wild. Although descriptive epidemiology reports low fertility among women 
experiencing stressful circumstances, attempts to detect a Bruce effect in 
humans have been rare and limited. We contribute to this limited work by 
examining the relationship between the odds of child death and the sex ratio at 
birth in Sweden for the years 1751-1840. We find evidence of a generalized Bruce 
effect in humans in that unexpected changes in child mortality predict opposite 
unexpected changes in the secondary sex ratio in the following year, even after 
adjusting for period life expectancy. Our analysis broadens the scope of the 
Bruce effect literature to include humans, suggesting that women, through 
noncognitive decisional biology, adjust reproductive strategies and investments 
in response to changing environmental conditions.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is widely accepted to be the major causative pathogen 
of cervical cancer, warts, and other epithelial tumors. Virus infection and 
subsequent disease development can be prevented by vaccination with HPV vaccines 
derived from eukaryotic expression systems. Here, we report the soluble 
expression of the major capsid protein L1 of HPV31, a dominant carcinogenic HPV 
genotype, in Escherichia coli. HPV31 L1 protein and its elongated form (L1+) 
were observed in SDS-PAGE and CE-SDS analysis, generated by the native HPV31 L1 
gene with a TAA stop codon. Replacing the TAA with TAG but not TGA could 
completely terminate protein translation. Mass spectrometry sequencing showed 
that L1+ comprised L1 with a C-terminal extension of 38 amino acids (aa). RNA 
folding analysis revealed that the unfaithful L1+ expression may result from 
translational read-through, as TAG is more stable and accessible than the other 
stop codons. The 38-aa elongated fragment perturbs self-assembly of HPV31 L1+, 
as shown in size and morphology analyses. By 3D cryo-electron microscopy 
structure determination, we show self-assembly of purified HPV31 L1 (TAG) VLPs 
into T = 7 icosahedral symmetry particles, resembling the native HPV virion. 
Finally, through additional characterization and antigenicity/immunogenicity 
assays, we verified that the E.coli-derived HPV31 VLPs are an ideal immunogen 
for HPV vaccine development. Our findings outline a codon optimization stratagem 
for protein expression and provide a method for the in-depth investigation of

BACKGROUND: Feicheng County is a high-risk area for esophageal cancer in 
Shandong province, China. It is important to determine the long-term 
spatio-temporal trends in epidemiological characteristics and the burden of 
esophageal cancer, especially since the implementation of the national 
esophageal cancer screening program for early detection and treatment in 2005.
METHODS: The data collected in Feicheng County from 2001 to 2012 was extracted 
from the whole-population cancer registry system. The incidence, mortality, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and changing trends in esophageal cancer 
according to age and sex were calculated and described.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of esophageal cancer in Feicheng was consistently 
high, and increased significantly for male, but not for female from 2001 to 
2012, according to the joinpoint regression analysis. The highest and lowest 
yearly crude incidence rates were 160.78 and 95.97 per 100000 for males, and 
81.36 and 52.17 per 100000 for females. The highest and lowest crude yearly 
mortality rates were 122.26 and 94.40 per 100000 for males, and 60.75 and 49.35 
per 100000for females. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was the main pathology 
type and the tumor location changed significantly from 2001 to 2012. Overall, 
the DALY remained roughly stable and was estimated as 11.50 for males and 4.90 
for females per 1000 people. The burden was mainly caused by premature death. 
There is an obvious spatial pattern in the distribution of incidence density and 
burden.
CONCLUSION: Esophageal cancer remains a public health issue in Feicheng County 
with a high incidence, mortality and disease burden. The incidence and burden 
have obvious spatial heterogeneity, and further studies should be conducted to 
identify geographical risk factors for precise local prevention and control 
measures.

Associations Between Early Implant Failure, Patient Age, and Patient Mortality: 
A 15-Year Follow-Up Study on 2,566 Patients Treated with Implant-Supported 
Prostheses in the Edentulous Jaw.

Jemt T, Nilsson M, Olsson M, Stenport VF.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to report the distribution of patients with 
early implant failures after implant treatment in the edentulous jaw with regard 
to age at surgery and association with patient mortality over a 15-year period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutively treated patients treated in the 
edentulous jaw at a single specialist clinic from 1986 to 1997 were included and 
followed up for 1 year for implant failures and for 15 years with regard to 
patient mortality. Patients were arranged into age groups, and life tables for 
patients and reference groups of patients with comparable age (based on national 
population data) were calculated. Log rank test was used to test differences in 
patient survival between those with reported early implant failures and those 
with no early failures. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test was used to test 
association between proportions of implant failures and age groups.
RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were excluded because they were not living in 
Sweden (nonresidents/emigrated). Altogether, 2,566 patients were included, with 
a mean age of 65 years (SD: 11). Of these, 988 patients were deceased during the 
15 years of follow-up (38%), and 291 presented an early implant failure (11.3%), 
most of them before prosthesis placement (72%). Patients with early implant 
failures presented higher mortality rates than patients with no failures (P < 
.05), and failure rates decreased consistently from younger to higher age groups 
(P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Patients in the younger age groups showed an increased mortality 
compared with the reference group (P < .05) and a higher prevalence of early 
failures compared with older patients (P < .05). Older patients showed an 
opposing pattern of lower mortality compared with reference groups of comparable 
age (P < .05), but both younger and older patients with early failures showed a 
higher mortality compared to patients with no failures (P < .05).

This study was performed to evaluate the effect of different doses (0, 1.5, 3, 
and 4.5 kGy) of e-beam irradiation on the quality parameters (pH, Hunter's 
parameter, and heme pigment) and stability qualifiers (peroxide value [POV], 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARSs], and total volatile basic 
nitrogen [TVBN]) of smoked duck meat during 40 d of storage under vacuum 
packaging at 4 °C. The initial populations of total bacteria (7.81 log CFU/g) 
and coliforms (5.68 log CFU/g) were reduced by approximately 2 to 5 log cycles 
with respect to irradiation doses. The results showed that pH, myoglobin, 
met-myoglobin, L* , a* , and b* showed significant differences with respect to 
different doses and storage intervals; a* and b* did not vary significantly 
because of storage. Higher pH was found in samples treated with 4.5 kGy at 40 d, 
while the minimum was observed in nonirradiated samples at day 0 of storage. 
Higher POV (2.31 ± 0.03 meq peroxide/kg) and TBARS (5.24 ± 0.03 mg MDA/kg) 
values were found in 4.5 kGy-treated smoked meat at 40 d and the lowest was 
reported in 0 kGy-treated meat at initiation of storage (0 d). However, 
irradiation suppressed TVBN during storage and higher TVBN (7.09 ± 0.32 mg/100 
mL) was found in duck meat treated with 0 kGy at 40 d. The electronic nose 
(e-nose) effectively distinguished flavor profiles during the different storage 
intervals. The results showed that different sensory attributes did not vary 
significantly with respect to the dose of irradiation. We conclude that low dose 
of e-beam irradiation and vacuum packaging is beneficial for safety and shelf 
life extension without affecting the sensory characteristics of smoked duck 
meat.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is complex, 
lengthy, and involves a minimum of four drugs termed a background regimen (BR), 
that have not previously been prescribed or that have proven susceptible to 
patient sputum culture isolates. In recent years, promising new treatment 
options have emerged as add-on therapies to a BR. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the long-term costs and effectiveness of adding the novel or group 5 
interventions bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid to a background regimen (BR) 
of drugs for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis (MDR-TB), within their marketing authorisations, from a German 
healthcare cost-effectiveness perspective.
METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was developed to simulate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of bedaquiline plus BR, delamanid plus BR, or linezolid 
plus BR versus BR alone in the treatment of MDR-TB, over a 10-year time horizon. 
Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated in Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) 
and Life-Years Gained (LYG), using inputs from clinical trials for bedaquiline 
and delamanid and from a German observational study for linezolid. Cost data 
were obtained from German Drug Directory costs (€/2015), published literature, 
and expert opinion. A 3% yearly discount rate was applied. Probabilistic and 
deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The total discounted costs per-patient were €85,575 for bedaquiline 
plus BR, €81,079 for delamanid plus BR, and €80,460 for linezolid plus BR, 
compared with a cost of €60,962 for BR alone. The total discounted QALYs 
per-patient were 5.95 for bedaquiline plus BR, 5.36 for delamanid plus BR, and 
3.91 for linezolid plus BR, compared with 3.68 for BR alone. All interventions 
were therefore associated with higher QALYs and higher costs than BR alone, with 
incremental costs per QALY gained of €22,238 for bedaquiline, €38,703 for 
delamanid, and €87,484 for linezolid, versus BR alone. In a fully incremental 
analysis, bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment option at 
thresholds greater than €22,000 per QALY gained. In probabilistic analyses, the 
probability that bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment 
strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 was 54.5%, compared with 
22.9% for BR alone, 18.2% for delamanid plus BR, and 4.4% for linezolid.
CONCLUSIONS: In Germany, the addition of bedaquiline, delamanid, or linezolid to 
a BR would result in QALY gains over BR alone. Based on this analysis, 
bedaquiline is likely to be the most cost-effective intervention for the 
treatment of MDR-TB, when added to a BR regimen at thresholds greater than 
€22,000 per QALY.

When making decisions regarding vascular access creation, the clinician and 
vascular access team must evaluate each patient individually with consideration 
of life expectancy, timelines for dialysis start, risks and benefits of access 
creation, referral wait times, as well as the risk for access complications. The 
role of the multidisciplinary team in facilitating access choice is reviewed, as 
well as the clinical evaluation of the patient.

Publisher: Au moment de prendre la décision de créer un accès vasculaire, le 
médecin traitant et l’équipe qui le soutient se doivent d’évaluer chaque patient 
de façon individuelle et tenir compte de plusieurs facteurs. Ces derniers 
incluent l’espérance de vie du patient, l’échéancier à respecter pour le 
démarrage de la dialyse, les risques et les avantages liés à la création d’un 
accès vasculaire, les temps d’attente à prévoir pour la consultation, de même 
que les risques de complications encourus à la suite de la procédure. Ce 
chapitre évalue le rôle de facilitateur que joue l’équipe multidisciplinaire 
dans la prise de décision de créer un accès vasculaire, de même que l’examen 
clinique du patient.

BACKGROUND: Weight gain and other metabolic sequelae of antipsychotic 
medications can lead to medication non-adherence, reduced quality of life, 
increased costs, and premature mortality. Of the approaches to address this, 
behavioral interventions are less invasive, cost less, and can result in 
sustained long-term benefits.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated behavioral weight management interventions for 
veterans with mental illness across four medical centers within the Veterans 
Affairs (VA) Healthcare System.
DESIGN: We conducted a 12-month, multi-site extension of our previous 
randomized, controlled study, comparing treatment and control groups.
PARTICIPANTS: Veterans (and some non-veteran women) diagnosed with mental 
illness, overweight (defined as having a BMI over 25), and required ongoing 
antipsychotic therapy.
INTERVENTIONS: One group received "Lifestyle Balance" (LB; modified from the 
Diabetes Prevention Program) consisting of classes and individual nutritional 
counseling with a dietitian. A second group received less intensive "Usual Care" 
(UC) consisting of weight monitoring and provision of self-help.
MAIN MEASURES: Participants completed anthropometric and nutrition assessments 
weekly for 8 weeks, then monthly. Psychiatric, behavioral, and physical 
assessments were conducted at baseline and months 2, 6, and 12. Metabolic and 
lipid laboratory tests were performed quarterly.
KEY RESULTS: Participants in both groups lost weight. LB participants had a 
greater decrease in average waist circumference [F(1,1244) = 11.9, p < 0.001] 
and percent body fat [F(1,1121) = 4.3, p = 0.038]. Controlling for gender 
yielded statistically significant changes between groups in BMI 
[F(1,1246) = 13.9, p < 0.001]. Waist circumference and percent body fat 
decreased for LB women [F(1,1243) = 22.5, p < 0.001 and F(1,1221) = 4.8, 
p = 0.029, respectively]. The majority of LB participants kept food and activity 
journals (92%), and average daily calorie intake decreased from 2055 to 1650 
during the study (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral interventions specifically designed for individuals with 
mental illness can be effective for weight loss and improve dietary behaviors. 
"Lifestyle Balance" integrates well with VA healthcare's patient-centered "Whole 
Health" approach. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01052714.

Many studies have focused on determining the effect of the body mass index (BMI) 
on the mortality in different cohorts. In this article, we propose an 
additive-multiplicative mean residual life (MRL) model to assess the effects of 
BMI and other risk factors on the MRL function of survival time in a cohort of 
Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. The proposed model can simultaneously manage 
additive and multiplicative risk factors and provide a comprehensible 
interpretation of their effects on the MRL function of interest. We develop an 
estimation procedure through pseudo partial score equations to obtain parameter 
estimates. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and 
conduct simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The 
application of the procedure to a study on the life expectancy of type 2 
diabetic patients reveals new insights into the extension of the life expectancy 
of such patients.

The combination of modern interventional and preventive medicine has led to an 
epidemic of ageing. While this phenomenon is a positive consequence of an 
improved lifestyle and achievements in a society, the longer life expectancy is 
often accompanied by decline in quality of life due to musculoskeletal pain and 
disability. The Aarhus Regenerative Orthopaedics Symposium (AROS) 2015 was 
motivated by the need to address regenerative challenges in an ageing population 
by engaging clinicians, basic scientists, and engineers. In this position paper, 
we review our contemporary understanding of societal, patient-related, and basic 
science-related challenges in order to provide a reasoned roadmap for the future 
to deal with this compelling and urgent healthcare problem.

Significance to human health of carbamazepine detected in fruits and vegetables 
irrigated with recycled water.

The relevance and significance of the findings of chemicals of emerging concern 
at nanogram concentrations in recycled water is critically important for the 
consumers of these crops. The relevance and significance of these chemicals at 
these concentrations is placed in perspective in terms of the number of years of 
consumption necessary to accrue one acceptable daily intake every day, over a 
lifetime, specifically for carbamazepine. In this paper, the number of years is 
calculated and found to far exceed the maximum human life expectancy, even 
assuming that the individual consumes a mix of fruits and vegetables irrigated 
with recycled water throughout an 80-year life span, excluding other food crops 
free from carbamazepine.

Performance of IUCN proxies for generation length.

One of the criteria used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature 
(IUCN) to assess threat status is the rate of decline in abundance over 3 
generations or 10 years, whichever is longer. The traditional method for 
calculating generation length (T) uses age-specific survival and fecundity, but 
these data are rarely available. Consequently, proxies that require less 
information are often used, which introduces potential biases. The IUCN 
recommends 2 proxies based on adult mortality rate, T̂d = α + 1/d, and 
reproductive life span, T̂z = α + z* RL, where α is age at first reproduction, d 
is adult mortality rate, RL is reproductive life span, and z is a coefficient 
derived from data for comparable species. We used published life tables for 78 
animal and plant populations to evaluate precision and bias of these proxies by 
comparing T̂d and T̂z with true generation length. Mean error rates in 
estimating T were 31% for T̂d and 20% for T̂z, but error rates for T̂d were 16% 
when we subtracted 1 year ( T̂d( adj )=T̂d-1 ), as suggested by theory; T̂d( adj 
) also provided largely unbiased estimates regardless of the true generation 
length. Performance of T̂z depends on compilation of detailed data for 
comparable species, but our results suggest taxonomy is not a reliable indicator 
of comparability. All 3 proxies depend heavily on a reliable estimate of age at 
first reproduction, as we illustrated with 2 test species. The relatively large 
mean errors for all proxies emphasized the importance of collecting the detailed 
life-history information necessary to calculate true generation length. 
Unfortunately, publication of such data is less common than it was decades ago. 
We identified generic patterns of age-specific change in vital rates that can be 
used to predict expected patterns of bias from applying T̂d( adj ).
