Currently, the forest plantations of Castanea sativa Mill. are largely damaged 
by phytopathogenic organisms, of which Cryphoneciria parasitica (Murrill) М. Е. 
Barr. has the most negative impact. The spread of this type of disease reduces 
the vital state and significantly reduces the life expectancy of C. sativa 
trees. For the first time, using dendrochronological analysis, the specificity 
of distribution and degree of phytopathogenic damage to C. sativa trunk tissues 
were assessed. It was revealed that in its lower part the dieback of the 
peripheral layers of wood occurs fairly evenly with a total degradation of 
cellular structures in the amount of 18-20%. In the middle segments of the trunk 
this figure increases almost twice. And the greatest degree of wood dieback is 
observed in the upper part of damaged trees. It was found that climatic changes 
of the last decades determine the strengthening of destructive processes in the 
woodland of C. sativa of the Caucasus.

Diaphania indica (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is an important 
phytophagous pest of Trichosanthes anguina L. in India. We studied life table 
parameters by age-stage, two-sex, amylolytic and proteolytic activities, and 
food utilization parameters of D. indica on the leaves of three T. anguina 
cultivars (Baruipur Long, Polo No. 1 and MNSR-1). Further, nutrients (total 
carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, amino acids and nitrogen) and antinutrients 
(total phenols, flavonols and tannins) in leaves were determined. The 
development time (egg to adult emergence) was the shortest on MNSR-1 (19.79 d) 
and the longest on Polo No. 1 (25.72 d). Fecundity was the highest and lowest on 
MNSR-1 (259 eggs) and Polo No. 1 (151.22 eggs), respectively. The lowest 
intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and net reproductive rate (R0) of D. indica on 
Polo No. 1 were 0.1112 d-1 and 27.22 offspring individual-1, respectively. The 
mean generation time (T) was the shortest on MNSR-1 (23.99 days) and the longest 
on Polo No. 1 (29.70 d). The larvae of D. indica fed with MNSR-1 had the highest 
level of amylolytic and proteolytic activities, and the lowest activities were 
in the larvae fed with Polo No. 1. The fifth-instar larvae fed with Polo No. 1 
had the lowest consumption index and growth rate. The higher larval development 
time and lower fecundity of D. indica on Polo No. 1 were due to the lower level 
of nutrients and a higher level of antinutrients than other cultivars. Our 
results concluded that Polo No. 1 cultivar could be suggested for cultivation.

DNA damage and epigenetic marks are well established to have profound influences 
on genome stability and cell phenotype, yet there are few technologies to obtain 
high-resolution genomic maps of the many types of chemical modifications of DNA. 
Here we present Nick-seq for quantitative, sensitive, and accurate mapping of 
DNA modifications at single-nucleotide resolution across genomes. Pre-existing 
breaks are first blocked and DNA modifications are then converted enzymatically 
or chemically to strand-breaks for both 3'-extension by nick-translation to 
produce nuclease-resistant oligonucleotides and 3'-terminal transferase tailing. 
Following library preparation and next generation sequencing, the complementary 
datasets are mined with a custom workflow to increase sensitivity, specificity 
and accuracy of the map. The utility of Nick-seq is demonstrated with genomic 
maps of site-specific endonuclease strand-breaks in purified DNA from Eschericia 
coli, phosphorothioate epigenetics in Salmonella enterica Cerro 87, and 
oxidation-induced abasic sites in DNA from E. coli treated with a sublethal dose 
of hydrogen peroxide. Nick-seq applicability is demonstrated with strategies for 
>25 types of DNA modification and damage.

PURPOSE: Worldwide cervical and breast cancers are among the most commonly 
diagnosed cancers and are leading cause of cancer deaths among females in low- 
and middle-income countries. In Guatemala, breast and cervical cancers are the 
main cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to determine the years of potential life lost (YPLL) as an indicator 
of premature deaths as a result of breast and cervical cancers.
METHODS: Data on the number of deaths as a result of breast and cervical cancers 
(International Classification of Diseases [10th revision] codes C50 and C53) 
between 2012 and 2016 and age composition by quinquennials were retrieved from 
the Health Information System of the Guatemalan Health Ministry. On the basis of 
each individual's age at death, YPLL was estimated for females between 20 and 70 
years of age.
RESULTS: A total of 1,476 deaths related to breast and cervical cancers was 
reported over the study period. The trend in breast cancer mortality rate and 
YPLL did not change from 2012 to 2016. The cervical cancer mortality rate has 
decreased to 10 deaths per 1 million habitants (P = .046). There has been a 
reduction in YPLL because of cervical cancer, from 50.18 YPLL in 2012 to 29.19 
YPLL by 2016, mainly in women between 30 and 34 years of age, in whom YPLL 
decreased from 600 to 112.50 (P = .046).
CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer screening has significantly reduced the mortality 
rate of this malignancy, and screening of breast cancer must include creating 
awareness of the disease and providing access to women at risk.

INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs are established to be cost-effective 
before implementation. WHO recommends HPV vaccination for girls aged 9-13 years 
to tackle the high burden of cervical cancer. This review examined the existing 
evidence on the cost-effectiveness of the 9-valent HPV vaccine within a global 
context.
METHODS: The literature search covering a period of January 2000 to 31 July 2019 
was conducted in PubMed and Scopus bibliographic databases. A combined checklist 
(i.e., WHO, Drummond and CHEERS) was used to examine the quality of eligible 
studies. A total of 12 studies were eligible for this review and most of them 
were conducted in developed countries.
RESULTS: Despite some heterogeneity in approaches to measure cost-effectiveness, 
ten studies concluded that 9vHPV vaccination was cost-effective and two did not. 
The addition of adolescent boys into immunisation programs was cost effective 
when vaccine price and coverage was comparatively low. When vaccination coverage 
for females was more than 75%, gender neutral HPV vaccination was less 
cost-effective than vaccination targeting only girls aged 9-18 years. Multi 
cohort immunization approach was found cost-effective in the age range of 9-14 
years. However, the upper age limit at which vaccination was found not 
cost-effective requires further evaluation. This review identified duration of 
vaccine protection, time horizon, vaccine price, coverage, healthcare costs, 
efficacy and discounting rates as the most dominating parameters in determining 
cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications in extending HPV immunization 
programs whether switching to the 9-valent vaccine or the inclusion of 
adolescent boys' vaccination or extending the age of vaccination. Further, this 
review also supports extending vaccination programs to low-resource settings 
where vaccine prices are competitive, donor funding is available, burden of 
cervical cancer is high and screening options are limited.

Nowadays, the shelf-life extension of foods is a topic of major interest because 
of its environmental and economic benefits. For this purpose, various methods 
like deep-freezing, ultra-high-temperature pasteurization, drying methods, use 
of chemicals, controlled-atmosphere preservation, ionizing irradiation, and were 
investigated. During the last years, the smart packaging for foods using natural 
biodegradable components is of great interest because it provides positive 
environmental fingerprint and high shelf-life extension. In the present work, a 
new nanostructured composite material, the ZnO/Na-Montmorillonite hybrid, was 
developed. The high antimicrobial properties of the 3-D ZnO material in 
combination with the high barrier and strength properties of the 2-D 
Na-Montmorillonite material provided a high promising component for food smart 
packaging applications. As an extra innovation of this process, the ZnO nanorods 
coated the external surface of the Na-Montmorillonite and it was not 
intercalated into the clay as a pillaring material. This new material was 
incorporated with a 3% w/w composition with a biodegradable poly(vinyl)alcohol 
(PVOH) polymeric matrix which also exhibits antimicrobial activity. The final 
product was tested via XRD, FTIR, SEM, tensile test, water sorption, water vapor 
permeability, oxygen permeability UV-vis, and anti-microbial activity tests and 
it exhibited advanced mechanical and antimicrobial properties, especially for a 
ZnO/Na-Montmorillonite fraction of 4:1.

Although improvement in early diagnosis and treatment ameliorated life 
expectancy of cancer patients, metastatic disease still lacks effective 
therapeutic approaches. Resistance to anticancer therapies stems from the 
refractoriness of a subpopulation of cancer cells-termed cancer stem cells 
(CSCs)-which is endowed with tumor initiation and metastasis formation 
potential. CSCs are heterogeneous and diverge by phenotypic, functional and 
metabolic perspectives. Intrinsic as well as extrinsic stimuli dictated by the 
tumor microenvironment (TME)have critical roles in determining cell metabolic 
reprogramming from glycolytic toward an oxidative phenotype and vice versa, 
allowing cancer cells to thrive in adverse milieus. Crosstalk between cancer 
cells and the surrounding microenvironment occurs through the interchange of 
metabolites, miRNAs and exosomes that drive cancer cells metabolic adaptation. 
Herein, we identify the metabolic nodes of CSCs and discuss the latest advances 
in targeting metabolic demands of both CSCs and stromal cells with the scope of 
improving current therapies and preventing cancer progression.

BACKGROUND: Recent life expectancy gains in high-income Asia-pacific countries 
have been largely the result of postponement of death from non-communicable 
diseases in old age, causing rapid demographic ageing. This study compared and 
quantified age- and cause-specific contributions to changes in old-age life 
expectancy in two high-income Asia-pacific countries with ageing populations, 
South Korea and Japan.
METHODS: This study used Pollard's actuarial method of decomposing life 
expectancy to compare age- and cause-specific contributions to changes in 
old-age life expectancy between South Korea and Japan during 1997 and 2017.
RESULTS: South Korea experienced rapid population ageing, and the gaps in life 
expectancy at 60 years old between South Korea and Japan were reduced by 
2.47 years during 1997 and 2017. Decomposition analysis showed that mortality 
reductions from non-communicable diseases in South Korea were the leading causes 
of death contributing to the decreased gaps in old-age life expectancy between 
the two countries. More specifically, mortality reductions from cardiovascular 
diseases (stroke, ischaemic and hypertensive heart disease) and cancers 
(stomach, liver, lung, pancreatic cancers) in South Korea contributed to the 
decreased gap by 1.34 and 0.41 years, respectively. However, increased mortality 
from Alzheimer and dementia, lower respiratory tract disease, self-harm and 
falls in South Korea widened the gaps by 0.41 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Age- and cause- specific contributions to changes in old-age life 
expectancy can differ between high-income Asia-pacific countries. Although the 
gaps in old-age life expectancy between high-income Asia-pacific countries are 
primarily attributed to mortality changes in non-communicable diseases, these 
countries should also identify potential emerging threats of communicable 
diseases and injuries along with demographic ageing in pursuit of healthy life 
years in old age.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy among persons living with HIV (PLWH) has improved 
with increasing access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), however incidence of 
chronic comorbidities has simultaneously increased. No data are available 
regarding the incidence of hypertension among Chinese PLWH.
METHODS: We analyzed data collected from patients enrolled in two prospective 
longitudinal multicenter studies of PLWH initiating ART in China. Incidence rate 
of hypertension per 100 person-years (PYs) among PLWH was calculated, and Cox 
proportional hazards models was used to evaluate the association between 
incident hypertension and traditional and HIV-associated risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 1078 patients included in this analysis, 984 ART-naïve patients were 
hypertension-free at baseline, and contributed 2337.7 PYs of follow up, with a 
median follow-up period of 1.8 years (range: 1.2-3.2) after initiation of ART. 
Incidence of hypertension was 7.6 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.5-8.7] per 
100 PYs. In the Cox regression analysis, incidence of hypertension was 
positively associated with body mass index [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.07 
(1.01,1.13), p = 0.02] and recent viral load (aHR 1.28, 95% CI:1.08-1.51, 
p < 0.01), and negatively associated with recent CD4+/CD8+ ratio (aHR 0.14, 95% 
CI:0.06-0.31, p < 0.001), zidovudine exposure (aHR 0.15, 95% CI: 0.10-0.24, 
p < 0.001) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure (aHR 0.13, 95% CI: 
0.08-0.21, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of hypertension was relatively high among Chinese 
PLWH initiating ART. Recent low CD4+/CD8+ ratio and detectable HIV viremia were 
associated with incident hypertension, whereas receipt of ART was associated 
with reduced risk. Hypertension may be mitigated, in part, by excellent HIV 
care, including viral suppression with ART.

Over the past few decades, longevity without disease has become an important 
topic worldwide. However, as life expectancy increases, the number of patients 
with cancer is also increasing. Tumor progression is related to interactions 
between tumor cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the tumor 
microenvironment. MSCs are multipotent stromal cells known to be present in a 
variety of locations in the body, including bones, cartilage, fat, muscles, and 
dental pulp. MSCs migrate toward inflamed areas during pathological immune 
responses. MSCs also migrate toward tumor stroma and participate in tumor 
progression. MSCs can contribute to tumor progression by interacting with tumor 
cells via paracrine signaling and differentiate into diverse cell types. This 
also enables MSCs to make direct contact with tumor cells in tumor stroma. 
Interactions between tumor cells and MSCs enhance tumorigenic and metastatic 
potential, in addition to stimulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition. 
Herein, we reviewed the research associated with the tumor-enhancing role of 
MSCs in tumor progression, from primary tumor growth to distant tumor 
metastasis.

The notochord defines the axial structure of all vertebrates during development. 
Notogenesis is a result of major cell reorganization in the mesoderm, the 
convergence and the extension of the axial cells. However, it is currently not 
fully understood how these processes act together in a coordinated way during 
notochord formation. The prechordal plate is an actively migrating cell 
population in the central mesoderm anterior to the trailing notochordal plate 
cells. We show that prechordal plate cells express Protocadherin 18a (Pcdh18a), 
a member of the cadherin superfamily. We find that Pcdh18a-mediated recycling of 
E-cadherin adhesion complexes transforms prechordal plate cells into a cohesive 
and fast migrating cell group. In turn, the prechordal plate cells subsequently 
instruct the trailing mesoderm. We simulated cell migration during early 
mesoderm formation using a lattice-based mathematical framework and predicted 
that the requirement for an anterior, local motile cell cluster could guide the 
intercalation and extension of the posterior, axial cells. Indeed, a grafting 
experiment validated the prediction and local Pcdh18a expression induced an 
ectopic prechordal plate-like cell group migrating towards the animal pole. Our 
findings indicate that the Pcdh18a is important for prechordal plate formation, 
which influences the trailing mesodermal cell sheet by orchestrating the 
morphogenesis of the notochord.

PURPOSE: Previous research indicated that the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) item bank v2.0 'Ability to Participate 
in Social Roles and Activities' may miss subdomains of social participation. The 
purpose of this study was to generate items for these missing subdomains and to 
evaluate their content validity.
METHODS: A three-step approach was followed: (1) Item generation for 16 
International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health subdomains 
currently not covered by the item bank; (2) Evaluation of content validity of 
generated items through expert review (n = 20) and think-aloud interviews with a 
purposeful sample of people with and without (chronic) health conditions 
(n = 10), to assess item comprehensibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness; 
and 3) Item revision based on the results of step 2, in a consensus procedure.
RESULTS: First, 48 items were generated. Second, overall, content experts 
indicated that the generated items were relevant. Furthermore, based on experts' 
responses, items were simplified and 'participation in social media' was 
identified as an important additional subdomain of social participation. 
Additionally, 'participating in various social roles simultaneously' was 
identified as a missing item. Based on the responses of the interviewed adults 
items were simplified. Third, in total 17 items, covering 17 subdomains, were 
proposed to be added to the original item bank.
DISCUSSION: The relevance, comprehensibility and comprehensiveness of the 17 
proposed items were supported. Whether the proposed extension of the item bank 
leads to better psychometric properties of the item bank should be tested in a 
large-scale field study.

PURPOSE: The increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) attributable 
to high body mass index (BMI) represents both a threat and an opportunity for 
intervention. Estimates of the global latest trend of high BMI-related NCDs and 
its association with socioeconomic status can facilitate strategic intervention 
and inform further research.
METHODS: This global burden of disease study extracted global, regional, and 
national data on death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable 
to high BMI-related NCDs from the GBD Study 2017. Secondary analyses were 
performed by year, age, sex, and specific causes of death and DALYs. The 2017 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) was used as an indicator of national socioeconomic 
status. The association between age-standardized death or DALYs rate and 
socioeconomic status were analyzed.
RESULTS: Worldwide, 4.7 million deaths and 147.7 million DALYs of NCDs were 
related to high BMI in 2017, with a projection to 5.5 million deaths and 176.9 
million DALYs in 2025. Globally, high BMI-related burden showed an increasing 
trend with males being more heavily impacted overall. The trend and magnitude of 
high BMI-related disease burden varied substantially in different geographical 
and socioeconomic regions. Specifically, the low-middle, middle, and high-middle 
SDI countries were associated with a higher burden. The leading three causes of 
DALYs attributable to high BMI in 2017 were ischemic heart diseases, stroke, and 
diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSIONS: High BMI-related burden of NCDs is worsening, particularly in 
developing countries. Our findings may enhance public awareness of interventions 
to reduce the diseases burden caused by high BMI.

Radiation oncology has the potential to be an excellent option for the frail 
elderly cancer patients because of its limited systemic toxicities. It can be 
effective for curative, prophylactic, disease control or palliative purposes. 
Currently about 60% of all cancer patients undergoing active treatment at some 
point receive radiation treatment. However, though widely used, there are 
limited clinical trials strictly designed for the elderly. This paper will 
review the key points in the assessment and treatment of elderly cancer patient 
including quality of life, active life expectancy, cognitive performance, 
frailty, sarcopenia and how the new technologies can help to reach the key goal 
of maintaining autonomy and independence for the elderly cancer patient.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a prevalent non-communicable disease among the world's 
growing elderly population. The contribution of the gut microbiota to T2D in 
several Westernized countries has been established. However, there is little 
information on the role of the gut microbiota in T2D from the African continent 
where lifestyle and life expectancy are different.
AIMS: This study sought to investigate gut microbiota variation in relation to 
elderly people living with T2D. in Nigeria.
METHODS: Whole microbial community DNA were derived from the stool samples of 
healthy urban-dwelling elderly individuals and urban-dwelling elderly 
individuals with T2D. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was Illumina-sequenced 
and analyzed using QIIME2.
RESULTS: Beta taxonomic diversity was significantly different between healthy 
elderly individuals and elderly individuals with T2D. However, no difference in 
the alpha taxonomic diversity and predicted functional alpha diversity of the 
gut microbiota was observed. The genus Ruminococcus (T2D versus Healthy: 2.89% 
vs 2.21%), families Coriobacteriaceae (Collinsella, T2D versus Healthy: 2.62 % 
vs 1.25%) and Bifidobacteriaceae were enriched in elderly individuals with T2D, 
while members of Clostridiaceae (Clostridium, Healthy versus T2D: 5.6% vs 3.2%) 
and Peptostreptococcaceae (Healthy versus T2D: 3.45% vs 1.99%) were enriched in 
healthy volunteers. Pathways involved in amino acid biosynthesis were enriched 
in elderly individuals with T2D, while pathways involved in respiration and the 
biosynthesis of vital building blocks were enriched in healthy volunteers.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated for the first time in an African elderly 
population that the abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae, Collinsella, and 
Ruminococcus within the gut varies in relation to T2D. Findings from this study 
suggest that the restoration of features associated with healthiness via the way 
of gut microbiota modification could be one step needed to improve elderly 
patient care.

Pylephlebitis has a high risk of mortality. Even with optimal medical 
management, the thrombus may propagate and require intervention. We present one 
such case in which extension of the thrombus from the superior mesenteric vein 
to the intrahepatic portal veins led to a life-threatening systemic response. 
Current endovascular techniques tailored with targeted pharmacomechanical 
thrombolytic therapy were combined with an exploratory laparotomy for septic 
control and resulted in an accelerated recovery.

OBJECTIVE: To study an effect of mexidol on the life expectancy, weight, seizure 
response thresholds, and impaired cognitive and motor functions during aging in 
male Wistar rats.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a long-term experiment, male Wistar rats, aged 3-26 
months, were assessed for impaired cognitive functions (passive avoidance 
conditioned reflex test), convulsive threshold (test with pentylenetetrazole), 
motor deficits (tests of rotating rod and pulling on the crossbar), and life 
expectancy. The rats received mexidol in the form of 0,15% solution, which 
replaced drinking water, during two 2 month courses at the age of 18-20 and 
22-24 month. A dose of mexidol consumed by the rat was 40-75 mg/kg/day.
RESULTS: In old male Wistar rats, the long-term treatment with mexidol increases 
the life expectancy, improves learning, preservation and reproduction of the 
memory trace in the passive avoidance conditioned reflex test, increases the 
convulsive threshold and improves muscle tone and coordination of movements that 
are impaired during aging.
CONCLUSION: Mexidol increases the threshold of convulsive reaction, restores 
cognitive and neurological deficits that occur during aging in male Wistar rats 
and increases the by its ability to influence mitochondriogenesis and 
antioxidant properties.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Изучение влияния Мексидола на нарушенные в 
процессе старения когнитивные и моторные функции, порог судорожной реакции, 
массу тела и продолжительность жизни у старых крыс-самцов линии Вистар.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: В длительном эксперименте у крыс-самцов линии Вистар 
оценивали нарушение когнитивных функций (тест условного рефлекса пассивного 
избегания), моторных нарушений (тесты вращающегося стержня и подтягивания на 
перекладину), судорожного порога (тест подкожного введения пентилентетразола), 
массу животного и продолжительность жизни. Мексидол в виде 0,15% раствора, 
который заменял питьевую воду, крысы получали 2 курсами по 2 мес: в возрасте 
18—20 и 22—24 мес. Потребляемая крысой доза Мексидола составляла 40—75 
мг/кг/сут.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Мексидол у старых крыс-самцов линии Вистар при длительном курсовом 
применении улучшает обучение, сохранение и воспроизведение памятного следа в 
тесте условного рефлекса пассивного избегания, повышает судорожный порог и 
улучшает мышечный тонус и координацию движений, нарушенные при старении, 
увеличивает продолжительность жизни. Применение Мексидола позволяет 
предотвратить существенное увеличение массы тела, характерное для старения.
ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: Мексидол уменьшает выраженность когнитивного и неврологического 
дефицита, возникающего при старении у крыс-самцов линии Вистар, повышает порог 
судорожной реакции и увеличивает продолжительность жизни, что определяется его 
способностью влиять на митохондриогенез и антиоксидантными свойствами.

BACKGROUND: Disease burden indicators assess the impact of disease on a 
population. They integrate mortality and disability in a single indicator. This 
allows setting priorities for health services and focusing resources.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the burden of neurological diseases in Peru from 
1990-2015.
METHODS: A descriptive study that used the epidemiological data published by the 
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation of Global Burden of Diseases from 
1990 to 2015. Disease burden was measured using disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY) and their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs), which results 
from the addition of the years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with 
disability (YLD).
RESULTS: The burden of neurological diseases in Peru were 9.06 and 10.65%, in 
1990 and 2015, respectively. In 2015, the main causes were migraine, 
cerebrovascular disease (CVD), neonatal encephalopathy (NE), and Alzheimer's 
disease and other dementias (ADD). This last group and nervous system cancer 
(NSC) increased 157 and 183% of DALY compared to 1990, respectively. Young 
population (25 to 44 years old) and older (>85 years old) were the age groups 
with the highest DALY. The neurological diseases produced 11.06 and 10.02% of 
the national YLL (CVD as the leading cause) and YLD (migraine as the main 
cause), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The burden of disease (BD) increased by 1.6% from 1990 to 2015. The 
main causes were migraine, CVD, and NE. ADD and NSC doubled the DALY in this 
period. These diseases represent a significant cause of disability attributable 
to the increase in the life expectancy of our population among other factors. 
Priority actions should be taken to prevent and treat these causes.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to provide an economic assessment of 
interventional vs. surgical aortic valve replacement in the context of 
cost-effectiveness. Aortic stenosis represents the most common form of 
degenerative valvular heart diseases. As life expectancy increases, an even 
emerging prevalence is expected. Over decades, surgical replacement was 
considered as the method of choice. Up to one third of the patients were not 
eligible for surgery, as their estimated peri-operative risk was too high. In 
the early 2000s a catheter-based technique has been developed, being an 
alternative treatment option for patients, considered to be inoperable.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic analysis of current literature was performed 
from September 2018 to December 2018. All suitable data in the field was 
obtained from Pubmed and Google/Google scholar. The search terms "TAVI AND 
costs," "TAVR and costs" and "aortic valve replacement AND costs" was entered in 
the search field, showing an overall amount of 317 publications. In a next step 
all obtained publications were screened by expert hand selection.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Recently the Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the low-risk setting. 
Nevertheless, concerns on the higher price remain. We performed an analysis of 
current literature on aortic stenosis and economic aspects. Out of 322 screened 
publications, 7 studies were found eligible by expert hand selection. Based on 
the predefined payment readiness of the analyzed healthcare system, TAVR 
appeared to have a slightly better cost effectiveness. Initial results within 
the early era seemed to be inconsistent. Recent publications showed, TAVR might 
be of more cost effectiveness when using the newest generation devices and a 
profound clinical experience is guaranteed.
CONCLUSIONS: We assume, that TAVR will not only be the method of choice for the 
treatment of aortic stenosis in many patients. As the valves are getting 
cheaper, TAVR might even be superior to conventional heart surgery from an 
economic point of view.

Proper diaphragm function is essential for adequate ventilation and the function 
of the lungs. The diaphragm is considered the most important muscle for 
inhalation than the scalene, intercostal, and sternocleidomastoid muscles. It is 
also an important barrier that separates the abdominal and thoracic cavities. 
The diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve separately on both the left and 
right sides. The phrenic nerve is composed of cervical nerve roots three through 
five. The diaphragm contracts downward to cause a negative intrathoracic 
pressure to allow lung expansion and passive airflow into the lungs for gas 
exchange. Diaphragm paralysis can be unilateral or bilateral; however, 
unilateral paralysis is more common. Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is a 
condition in which either the right or left side of the diaphragm loses the 
ability to contract to allow proper inspiration. This can result from muscular 
issues in the diaphragm or loss of innervation from the phrenic nerve to the 
hemidiaphragm. This can impact daily living by causing dyspnea at rest or during 
exercise, sleep disturbances, or in severe cases, decreased life 
expectancy. There are multiple potential causes for diaphragm dysfunction, 
including trauma or compression of the phrenic nerve, medications, demyelinating
