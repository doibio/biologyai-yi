BACKGROUND: Hemophilia is known as one of the most common coagulation disorders 
whose treatment costs are particularly high in developing countries, and about 
90% of them are related to factor VIII (FVIII) and direct medical costs (DMCs). 
Thus, the present study aimed to analyze cost-utility of two FVIII diet 
therapies prepared using blood plasma and recombinant technique.
METHODS: This study was an economic evaluation fulfilled through a cost-utility 
approach. To this end, a total number of 120 patients were randomly selected 
using Krejcie & Morgan's Table and then received blood plasma and recombinant 
FVIII. The decision tree structure was also utilized to estimate economic and 
clinical outcomes. Moreover, costs were reviewed from societal perspective. 
Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was subsequently determined as the measure of 
effectiveness (MOE). Besides, one-way (univariate) sensitivity analysis was 
performed to quantify uncertainty effects of the study parameters. The 
information was ultimately analyzed using the TreeAge Pro 2011 and the Microsoft 
Office Excel 2010 software.
RESULTS: The results revealed that the recombinant diet therapy had higher costs 
and effectiveness compared with blood-plasma-derived FVIII, so that the mean 
costs of these two diet therapies were equal to 37,624 and 20,349 purchasing 
power parity (PPP) $ with utility scores of 0.78 and 0.62; respectively. Since 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the recombinant medications 
was over three times of the threshold level, it was considered as overwhelming 
because of its high cost in spite of its better effectiveness. Moreover, the 
results of one-way (univariate) sensitivity analysis demonstrated the highest 
sensitivity to the utility in patients who had been injected with 
blood-plasma-derived FVIII and had been successfully treated.
CONCLUSION: The study results revealed that FVIII prepared using blood plasma 
for hemophilia A patients had higher cost-effectiveness compared with that made 
using recombinant technique. Graphical abstract.

INTRODUCTION: Obese patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) are often 
denied access to heart transplantation until they obtain significant weight loss 
to achieve a certain BMI threshold, often less than 35 kg/m2. It is unknown 
whether the rapid weight loss associated with bariatric surgery leads to 
improved waitlist placement, and as such improved survival for morbidly obese 
patients with CHF.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to 
simulate the life of morbidly obese patients with CHF who were deemed ineligible 
to be waitlisted for heart transplantation unless they achieved a BMI less than 
35 kg/m2. Life expectancy following medical weight management (MWM), Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass (RYGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) was estimated. Base case 
patients were defined as having a pre-intervention BMI of 45 kg/m2. Sensitivity 
analysis of initial BMI was performed. Markov parameters were extracted from 
literature review.
RESULTS: RYGB improved survival compared with both SG and MWM. RYGB patients had 
higher rates of transplantation, leading to improved mean long-term survival. 
Base case patients who underwent RYGB gained 2.1 additional years of life 
compared with patient's who underwent SG and 7.4 additional years of life 
compared with MWM. SG patients gained 5.3 years of life compared with MWM.
CONCLUSIONS: When strict waitlist criteria were applied, bariatric surgery 
improved access to heart transplantation and thereby increased long-term 
survival compared with MWM. Morbidly obese CHF patients who anticipate need for 
heart transplantation should be encouraged to pursue surgical weight management 
strategies, necessitating discussion between bariatric surgeons, cardiologists, 
and cardiac surgeons for appropriate perioperative risk management.

Quantifying trends in ecosystem extent is essential to understanding the status 
of ecosystems. Estimates of ecosystem loss are widely used to track progress 
toward conservation targets, monitor deforestation, and identify ecosystems 
undergoing rapid change. Satellite remote sensing has become an important source 
of information for estimating these variables. Despite regular acquisition of 
satellite data, many studies of change in ecosystem extent use only static 
snapshots, which ignores considerable amounts of data. This approach limits the 
ability to explicitly estimate trend uncertainty and significance. Assessing the 
accuracy of multiple snapshots also requires time-series reference data which is 
often very costly and sometimes impossible to obtain. We devised a method of 
estimating trends in ecosystem extent that uses all available Landsat satellite 
imagery. We used a dense time series of classified maps that explicitly 
accounted for covariates that affect extent estimates (e.g., time, cloud cover, 
and seasonality). We applied this approach to the Hukaung Valley Wildlife 
Sanctuary, Myanmar, where rapid deforestation is greatly affecting the lowland 
rainforest. We applied a generalized additive mixed model to estimate forest 
extent from more than 650 Landsat image classifications (1999-2018). Forest 
extent declined significantly at a rate of 0.274%/year (SE = 0.078). Forest 
extent declined from 91.70% (SE = 0.02) of the study area in 1999 to 86.52% (SE 
= 0.02) in 2018. Compared with the snapshot method, our approach improved 
estimated trends of ecosystem loss by allowing significance testing with 
confidence intervals and incorporation of nonlinear relationships. Our method 
can be used to identify significant trends over time, reduces the need for 
extensive reference data through time, and provides quantitative estimates of 
uncertainty.

Publisher: Estimación de los Cambios y Tendencias en la Extensión de los 
Ecosistemas Mediante Teledetección Satelital de Series Temporales Densas Resumen 
Las tendencias de cuantificación de la extensión de los ecosistemas es esencial 
para el entendimiento de su estado. Las estimaciones de pérdidas de los 
ecosistemas se usan con amplitud para rastrear el progreso hacia los objetivos 
de conservación, monitorear la deforestación e identificar a los ecosistemas que 
están experimentando un cambio rápido. La teledetección satelital se ha 
transformado en una fuente importante de información para la estimación de estas 
variables. A pesar de la obtención de datos satelitales, muchos estudios sobre 
el cambio en la extensión de los ecosistemas usan solamente capturas estáticas, 
lo cual ignora cantidades considerables de datos. Esta estrategia limita la 
habilidad que se tiene para estimar explícitamente la incertidumbre e 
importancia de la tendencia. La valoración de la precisión de múltiples capturas 
también requiere datos de referencia de series temporales, lo cual es muy 
costoso e imposible de conseguir en algunos casos. Diseñamos un método para 
estimar las tendencias en la extensión de los ecosistemas que usa todas las 
imágenes satelitales disponibles en Landsat. Usamos una serie temporal densa de 
los mapas clasificados que considera explícitamente a las covarianzas que 
afectan a las estimaciones de la extensión (p.ej.: tiempo, cobertura de nubes y 
estacionalidad). Aplicamos esta estrategia en el Santuario de Vida Silvestre del 
Valle de Huakaung en Myanmar, en donde la deforestación acelerada está afectando 
enormemente a la selva de tierras bajas. Aplicamos también un modelo mixto, 
aditivo y generalizado para estimar la extensión del bosque a partir de más de 
650 clasificaciones de imágenes en Landsat (1999 - 2018). La extensión del 
bosque declinó significativamente a una tasa de 0.274%/año (SE 0.078). La 
extensión del bosque declinó del 91.70% (SE 0.02) del área de estudio en 1999 a 
86.52% (SE 0.02) en 2018. Si la comparamos con la estrategia de las capturas, 
nuestra estrategia mejoró las tendencias estimadas de la pérdida del ecosistema 
al permitir la evaluación de significancia con intervalos de confianza y la 
incorporación de relaciones no lineales. Nuestro método puede usarse para 
identificar las tendencias significativas a lo largo del tiempo; también reduce 
la necesidad de tener datos de referencia extensos a lo largo del tiempo y 
proporciona estimaciones cuantitativas de la incertidumbre.

[DOHaD: a disease-oriented, epoch-making, British-originated theory with 
Hungarian roots].

[Article in Hungarian; Abstract available in Hungarian from the publisher]

Intézet,Semmelweis EgyetemBudapest.

On the basis of comparative epidemiological statistical studies, the 
’developmental origin of health and disease’ (DOHaD) theory was published in 
1986, testifying the interrelation between certain perinatal events, like under- 
and overfeeding as well as infant mortality with cardiovascular lethality in 
adults (Barker DJ, Osmond C, Lancet, 1986; 137: 1077–1081) – and at present it 
is widely extended. The theory is rather similar to the hormonal imprinting 
concept, which had been published 6 years earlier (Csaba G, Biol Rev Cambr 
Philos Soc. 1980; 55: 47–63 and Horm Metab Res. 1984; 16: 329–335). This 
demonstrated the role of perinatal encounter with hormones or hormone-like 
molecules with adult’s endocrino-pathological events based on animal 
experiments. Barker hypothesized the role of hormonal imprinting in DOHaD 
(Phillips DI, Barker DJ, Osmond C, Acta Endocrinol (Copenh). 1993; 129: 134–138: 
„A possible explanation is that thyroid hormones present in the breast milk and 
absorbed by the suckling infant could, by the process of hormonal imprinting, 
permanently down-regulate the set point of thyroid homeostasis”, and this could 
have encouraged him to create the theory. Both theories suggest the relationship 
between the perinatal events and adult-age disease manifestation, however, in 
the case of faulty imprinting, perinatal disease does not have a role in the 
provocation by imprinters (only the encounter between the imprinter and the 
hormone receptor), but in the case of DOHaD, this seems to be involved in the 
process. The whole process points to the disturbance of epigenetic programming. 
On the basis of the present standpoint, DOHaD is valid in non-communicative 
diseases, however, considering the impact of faulty hormonal imprinting to the 
immune system, the extension to communicative diseases is expected and likely 
also the involvement of lifespan. Further critical developmental period is the 
adolescence (puberty), when similar reprogramming could be possible and also in 
certain cases (e.g., in the immune system) disease-causing reprogramming could 
occur during the whole life. The two concepts are not racing, but using 
different methods for verification supplement and support each other, by 
building up identical conclusions (faulty reprogramming) giving epigenetical 
explanation for numerous diseases. DOHaD and its antecedent, hormonal imprinting 
are not only theories, but realities, which are commendable to consider in 
diagnosis and therapy. Studying the tendencies of human creativeness, in all 
probability, the importance of DOHaD (and faulty imprinting) will be growing in 
the near and far future. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(16): 603–609.

Publisher: A „developmental origin of health and disease” (DOHaD-) teória 
1986-ban jelent meg, összehasonlító epidemiológiai vizsgálatokkal bizonyítva a 
korai fejlődésben megmutatkozó kóros eltérések (például alul- vagy 
túltápláltság, csecsemőkori halálozás) statisztikai összefüggését felnőttkori 
nem kommunikábilis betegségek (például ischaemiás szívbetegségek, hypertonia) 
megjelenésével – és azóta széleskörűen elterjedt. A teória nagyon hasonló a 
hormonális imprinting koncepciójához, mely 6 évvel korábban jelent meg, és 
állatkísérletek alapján bizonyította a hormonszerű molekulákkal való perinatalis 
találkozás szerepét a felnőttkori endokrin és endokrin szabályozás alatt álló 
kóros jelenségek fellépésében. Ami mindkét teóriában azonos, az a perinatalis 
expozíció és a felnőttkori jelenség (betegség) összefüggése – ez az epigenetikai 
programozás zavarára utal. Barker a rendkívül fontos DOHaD-elmélet 
megalkotásakor már ismerte a hormonális imprintinget, amelyet a DOHaD lehetséges 
okának minősített, s ez bátoríthatta az elmélet kidolgozásakor. Barker szerint a 
DOHaD a nem fertőző betegségekre vonatkozik, de figyelembe véve, hogy a hibás 
hormonális imprinting az immunrendszer felnőttkori működését is alapvetően és 
életreszólóan befolyásolja, lehetséges a fertőző betegségek, sőt az élettartam 
érintettsége is. A perinatalis időszakon kívüli kritikus periódus még a 
pubertás, amikor hibás átprogramozódás fordulhat elő, de bizonyos, folyamatosan 
differenciálódó sejtrendszerekben (például az immunrendszerben) a hibás 
imprinting felnőttkorban is létrejöhet. A két teória nem versenyez egymással, de 
eltérő módszereket alkalmazva és azonos következtetésre jutva kiegészíti és 
támogatja egymást, számos betegség epigenetikai magyarázatát (hibás 
átprogramozás) adva meg. A DOHaD és előzménye, a hormonális imprinting tehát 
nemcsak teóriák, de realitások, melyeket a diagnosztikában éppúgy, mint a 
terápiában ajánlatos figyelembe venni. Végiggondolva az emberi alkotótevékenység 
tendenciáit, a DOHaD (és a hibás imprinting) jelentősége a közeli és távoli 
jövőben várhatólag növekedni fog. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(16): 603–609.

BACKGROUND: With increases in life expectancy, percutaneous coronary 
intervention is being performed more often, even in elderly patients with acute 
myocardial infarction. However, the optimal management of nonagenarians with 
acute myocardial infarction is uncertain. This study sought to investigate 
clinical outcomes of nonagenarians who undergo percutaneous coronary 
intervention.
METHODS: Of 2640 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction 
hospitalised within 24 hours after symptom onset in 2009-2018, we prospectively 
analysed 96 nonagenarians (median age 92 years; interquartile range 91-94) who 
underwent percutaneous coronary intervention.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 375 days. Inhospital major bleeding 
(Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 3 or 5) and inhospital death 
occurred in 15.6% and 17.7% of patients, respectively. The proportion of 
patients with frailty increased during hospitalisation, from 43.8% (mild frailty 
37.5%; moderate to severe frailty 6.3%) at admission to 60.7% (mild frailty 
46.8%; moderate to severe frailty 13.9%) at discharge (P < 0.01). The cumulative 
incidence of all-cause mortality was 22.2% at 180 days and 27.5% at 365 days. 
After adjusting for confounders, cardiogenic shock (hazard ratio (HR) 2.85; 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.07-7.64) and final thrombolysis in myocardial 
infarction flow grade less than 3 (HR 2.45; 95% CI 1.03-5.58) were associated 
with higher mid-term mortality and cardiac rehabilitation (HR 0.25; 95% CI, 
0.13-0.50) was associated with lower mid-term mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The mid-term mortality of selected nonagenarians with acute 
myocardial infarction who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention is 
reasonable, but older patients have high rates of inhospital major bleeding and 
progression of frailty. This study provides physicians, patients and families 
with important information for therapeutic decision-making.

Aim: We investigated cost effectiveness of benralizumab vs. standard of care 
(SOC) plus oral corticosteroids (OCS) for patients with severe, eosinophilic 
OCS-dependent asthma in Sweden.Materials and methods: A three-state, 
cohort-based Markov model of data from three Phase III benralizumab clinical 
trials (ZONDA [NCT02075255], SIROCCO [NCT01928771], and CALIMA [NCT01914757]) 
was used to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of benralizumab vs. 
SOC plus OCS. Health outcomes were estimated in terms of quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). The model included costs and disutilities associated with 
extrapolated OCS-related adverse events. Patients with severe asthma were 
defined as those receiving OCS ≥5 mg/day.Results: Benralizumab demonstrated a 
cost-effectiveness ratio vs. SOC plus OCS of 2018 Swedish Kronor (SEK) 366,855 
(€34,127) per QALY gained, based on increases of 1.33 QALYs and SEK 488,742 
(€45,344) per patient. Benralizumab treatment costs contributed most to 
incremental costs. The probability of benralizumab's being cost-effective with 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds between SEK 429,972 (€40,000) and SEK 
752,452 (€70,000) ranged from 75% to 99%.Limitations: Potential limitations of 
these analyses include the use of combined data from three different clinical 
trials, a one-way sensitivity analysis that did not include mortality and 
transition estimates, and Observational & Pragmatic Research Institute (OPRI) 
data from the UK as a proxy of the Swedish health care system.Conclusions: The 
results of these analyses demonstrate that benralizumab has a high probability 
of being cost-effective compared with SOC plus OCS for a subgroup of patients 
with severe, eosinophilic asthma receiving regular OCS treatment and may support 
clinicians, payers and patients in making treatment decisions.

Amino acids exert many biological functions, serving as allosteric regulators 
and neurotransmitters, as constituents in proteins and as nutrients. 
GCN2-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (elF2α) 
restores homeostasis in response to amino acid starvation (AAS) through the 
inhibition of the general translation and upregulation of amino acid 
biosynthetic enzymes and transporters by activating the translation of Gcn4 and 
ATF4 in yeast and mammals, respectively. GCN1 is a GCN2-binding protein that 
possesses an RWD binding domain (RWDBD) in its C-terminus. In yeast, Gcn1 is 
essential for Gcn2 activation by AAS; however, the roles of GCN1 in mammals need 
to be established. Here, we revealed a novel role of GCN1 that does not depend 
on AAS by generating two Gcn1 mutant mouse lines: Gcn1-knockout mice (Gcn1 KO 
mice (Gcn1-/-)) and RWDBD-deleted mutant mice (Gcn1ΔRWDBD mice). Both mutant 
mice showed growth retardation, which was not observed in the Gcn2 KO mice, such 
that the Gcn1 KO mice died at the intermediate stage of embryonic development 
because of severe growth retardation, while the Gcn1ΔRWDBD embryos showed mild 
growth retardation and died soon after birth, most likely due to respiratory 
failure. Extension of pregnancy by 24 h through the administration of 
progesterone to the pregnant mothers rescued the expression of differentiation 
markers in the lungs and prevented lethality of the Gcn1ΔRWDBD pups, indicating 
that perinatal lethality of the Gcn1ΔRWDBD embryos was due to simple growth 
retardation. Similar to the yeast Gcn2/Gcn1 system, AAS- or UV 
irradiation-induced elF2α phosphorylation was diminished in the Gcn1ΔRWDBD mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), suggesting that GCN1 RWDBD is responsible for GCN2 
activity. In addition, we found reduced cell proliferation and G2/M arrest 
accompanying a decrease in Cdk1 and Cyclin B1 in the Gcn1ΔRWDBD MEFs. Our 
results demonstrated, for the first time, that GCN1 is essential for both 
GCN2-dependent stress response and GCN2-independent cell cycle regulation.

INTRODUCTION: Mortality caused by ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has 
declined because of greater use of primary percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI). It is unknown if patients >75 have similar survival as peers. We aim to 
know it stratifying by sex and assessing how the sex may impact the survival.
METHODS: We retrospectively selected all patients >75 who suffered a STEMI 
treated with primary PCI at our institution. We compared their survival with 
that of the reference population (general population matched by age, sex, and 
geographical region). A Cox-regression analysis controlling for clinical factors 
was performed to know if sex was a risk factor.
RESULTS: Total of 450 patients were studied. Survival at 1, 3, and 5 years of 
follow-up for patients who survived the first 30 days was 91.22% (CI95% 
87.80-93.72), 79.71% (CI95% 74.58-83.92), and 68.02% (CI95% 60.66-74.3), whereas 
in the reference population it was 93.11%, 79.10%, and 65.01%, respectively. Sex 
was not a risk factor, Hazard Ratio = 1.02 (CI95% 0.67-1.53; p = 0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy of patients suffering a STEMI is nowadays 
intimately linked to survival in the first 30 days. After one year, the risk of 
death for both men and women seems similar to that of the general population.

The effect of seven herbicides (U-46 Combi Fluid, Cruz, MR, Basagran Bromicide, 
Lumax, and Gramoxone) on Xanthium strumarium plants was studied. Chlorophyll 
content and fluorescence, leaf temperature, and stomatal conductance were 
evaluated at 12 h, 36 h, 60 h, and 84 h after herbicides application. U46 Combi 
Fluid, Cruz, and MR did not have a significant effect on chlorophyll 
fluorescence induction curves as compared to the control treatment. However, 
Basagran, Bromicide, Lumax, and Gramoxone showed significant changes in the 
shape of polyphasic fluorescence transients (OJIP transients). Variations in 
chlorophyll content index, leaf temperature, and stomatal conductance parameters 
were dependent on the type of applied herbicide. Our study revealed that the 
specific impact of the applied herbicides on the photosynthetic efficiency of 
plants is related to their chemical groups and their mechanism of action.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) use is increasing in 
patients with longer life expectancy, yet robust data on the durability of 
transcatheter heart valves (THVs) are limited. Redo-TAVR may play a key strategy 
in treating patients in whom THVs fail.
OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to examine outcomes following redo-TAVR.
METHODS: The Redo-TAVR registry collected data on consecutive patients who 
underwent redo-TAVR at 37 centers. Patients were classified as probable TAVR 
failure or probable THV failure if they presented within or beyond 1 year of 
their index TAVR, respectively.
RESULTS: Among 63,876 TAVR procedures, 212 consecutive redo-TAVR procedures were 
identified (0.33%): 74 within and 138 beyond 1 year of the initial procedure. 
For these 2 groups, TAVR-to-redo-TAVR time was 68 (38 to 154) days and 5 (3 to 
6) years. The indication for redo-TAVR was THV stenosis in 12 (16.2%) and 51 
(37.0%) (p = 0.002) and regurgitation or combined stenosis-regurgitation in 62 
(83.8%) and 86 (62.3%) (p = 0.028), respectively. Device success using VARC-2 
criteria was achieved in 180 patients (85.1%); most failures were attributable 
to high residual gradients (14.1%) or regurgitation (8.9%). At 30-day and 1-year 
follow-up, residual gradients were 12.6 ± 7.5 mm Hg and 12.9 ± 9.0 mm Hg; valve 
area 1.63 ± 0.61 cm2 and 1.51 ± 0.57 cm2; and regurgitation ≤mild in 91% and 
91%, respectively. Peri-procedural complication rates were low (3 stroke [1.4%], 
7 valve malposition [3.3%], 2 coronary obstruction [0.9%], 20 new permanent 
pacemaker [9.6%], no mortality), and symptomatic improvement was substantial. 
Survival at 30 days was 94.6% and 98.5% (p = 0.101) and 83.6% and 88.3% 
(p = 0.335) at 1 year for patients presenting with early and late valve 
dysfunction, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Redo-TAVR is a relatively safe and effective option for selected 
patients with valve dysfunction after TAVR. These results are important for 
applicability of TAVR in patients with long life expectancy in whom THV 
durability may be a concern.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of pharmacy-based intranasal 
naloxone distribution to high-risk prescription opioid (RxO) users.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model with an attached tree for pharmacy-based 
naloxone distribution to high-risk RxO users using 2 approaches: one-time and 
biannual follow-up distribution. The Markov structure had 6 health states: 
high-risk RxO use, low-risk RxO use, no RxO use, illicit opioid use, no illicit 
opioid use, and death. The tree modeled the probability of an overdose 
happening, the overdose being witnessed, naloxone being available, and the 
overdose resulting in death. High-risk RxO users were defined as individuals 
with prescription opioid doses greater than or equal to 90 morphine milligram 
equivalents (MME) per day. We used a monthly cycle length, lifetime horizon, and 
US healthcare perspective. Costs (2018) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
were discounted 3% annually. Microsimulation was performed with 100 000 
individual trials. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
conducted.
RESULTS: One-time distribution of naloxone prevented 14 additional overdose 
deaths per 100 000 persons, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
of $56 699 per QALY. Biannual follow-up distribution led to 107 additional lives 
being saved with an ICER of $84 799 per QALY compared with one-time 
distribution. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that a biannual 
follow-up approach would be cost-effective 50% of the time at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100 000 per QALY. Naloxone effectiveness 
and proportion of overdoses witnessed were the 2 most influential parameters for 
biannual distribution.
CONCLUSION: Both one-time and biannual follow-up naloxone distribution in 
community pharmacies would modestly reduce opioid overdose deaths and be 
cost-effective at a WTP of $100 000 per QALY.

OBJECTIVES: Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are 
prescribed sequentially in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Healthcare decision makers continue to debate their use, mainly because of their 
high costs. Our aim was to perform an economic evaluation for France of bDMARD 
sequences for treatment of moderate-to-severe RA after inadequate response or 
intolerance to conventional DMARDs (eg, methotrexate).
METHODS: A discretely integrated condition event simulation was developed to 
track the course of patients from first bDMARD through switches to further lines 
in a sequence. The model included 11 events, 91 conditions, and 21 controlling 
equations. Inputs were obtained from a meta-analysis of clinical trials, a 
French registry, national drug lists, and databases. Survival, time with minimal 
activity, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total costs were output. 
Structural and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Sequences starting with etanercept biosimilars (ETB) cost less, with 
ETB-abatacept-infliximab the least expensive: the mean lifetime discounted total 
cost was €116 912 per patient, with a mean of 11.166 QALYs. Most other 
strategies were dominated or led to small QALY gains (0.0008-0.0329). Only 
ETB-tocilizumab-abatacept made it onto the efficiency frontier, but at €955 778 
per QALY gained. These results were confirmed in several scenarios and 
uncertainty analyses.
CONCLUSION: Given minor differences in QALYs gained between bDMARD sequences 
with large cost differences, starting with biosimilars was more efficient than 
starting with branded products. Our model and findings should provide French and 
other decision makers with useful tools to address the challenges of comparing 
sequences of treatments for RA.

OBJECTIVES: The EQ-5D-5L valuation protocol recommends combining time trade-off 
(TTO) and discrete choice experiments (DCEs). DCEs that include a duration 
attribute (DCETTO) allow modeling on the quality-adjusted life-year scale. 
Because the choice sequence in a TTO can be construed as a series of DCETTO, we 
used data from a single TTO study to investigate the extent to which DCE values 
match TTO values when based on identical preferences.
METHODS: In a TTO design in which a fixed set of choices were administered 
without termination at preference indifference, 202 individuals each valued 10 
EQ-5D health states. From identified indifference points, we estimated three 
sets of TTO values: (i) plotting means and (ii) applying censored regressions 
at -1 and 1. Using all strict preferences, we (iii) estimated DCETTO values with 
a logit model and a bootstrap procedure.
RESULTS: Estimated DCETTO and TTO values agreed well at the severe end of the 
quality-adjusted life-year scale, but with decreasing severity, DCETTO values 
were higher than TTO-values, with the difference peaking at 0.37 for the mildest 
health state. Left-censoring TTO values at -1 worsen the agreement for the worst 
health states and did not affect health states. Right censoring at 1 improved 
the agreement for mild states.
CONCLUSIONS: TTO and the DCETTO values estimated from the same preference data 
diverged, with increasing difference for milder health states. Although the 
values converged when applying censored regression at +1, we question the 
validity of this adjustment.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy is increasing. Sleep problems are more likely with 
advancing age however, are largely overlooked, and the longitudinal health 
impact of reported sleep problems is unclear. In this study, relationships were 
examined between reporting prior or current sleep problems with health outcomes, 
among Māori and non-Māori of advanced age.
METHOD: Data were available from 251 Māori and 398 non-Māori adults (79-90 
years) from Wave 1 (W1) of Te Puāwaitanga o Ngā Tapuwae Kia Ora Tonu. Life and 
Living in Advanced Age: A Cohort Study in NZ (LiLACS NZ). Four years later (W5), 
data were available from 85 Māori and 200 non-Māori participants. Relationships 
between reporting problem sleep at W1 and cohort and health outcomes at W5 were 
investigated using generalised linear models and Cox proportional hazards 
models.
RESULTS: Over 25% reported sleep problems at both waves. Mortality was 
associated with problem sleep for Māori but not non-Māori. Within the whole 
group, W1 problem sleepers were more likely to still have problems at W5, 
compared with nonproblem sleepers at W1. They also had poorer indicators of 
physical health and pain at W5. Problem sleepers at W5 had poorer concurrent 
mental health and increased likelihood of hospital admittance in the last year.
CONCLUSION: Sleep health is an important characteristic of ageing well, 
particularly for Māori. Early recognition and management of sleep problems could 
improve physical and mental health with advancing age.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs and project the potential lifetime 
cost-effectiveness of the ongoing Autoimmunity Screening for Kids (ASK) program, 
a large-scale, presymptomatic type 1 diabetes screening program for children and 
adolescents in the metropolitan Denver region.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the resource utilization, costs, and 
effectiveness measures from the ongoing ASK program compared with usual care 
(i.e., no screening). Additionally, we report a practical screening scenario by 
including utilization and costs relevant to routine screening in clinical 
practice. Finally, we project the potential cost-effectiveness of ASK and 
routine screening by identifying clinical benchmarks (i.e., diabetic 
ketoacidosis [DKA] events avoided, HbA1c improvements vs. no screening) needed 
to meet value thresholds of $50,000-$150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained over a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: Cost per case detected was $4,700 for ASK screening and $14,000 for 
routine screening. To achieve value thresholds of $50,000-$150,000 per QALY 
gained, screening costs would need to be offset by cost savings through 20% 
reductions in DKA events at diagnosis in addition to 0.1% (1.1 mmol/mol) 
improvements in HbA1c over a lifetime compared with no screening for patients 
who develop type 1 diabetes. Value thresholds were not met from avoiding DKA 
events alone in either scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: Presymptomatic type 1 diabetes screening may be cost-effective in 
areas with a high prevalence of DKA and an infrastructure facilitating screening 
and monitoring if the benefits of avoiding DKA events and improved HbA1c persist 
over long-run time horizons. As more data are collected from ASK, the model will 
be updated with direct evidence on screening effects.

Educational Program for Retiring Persons: A Community Experience in Cienfuegos 
Province, Cuba.

Ponce-Laguardia TM.

Comment in
    MEDICC Rev. 2020 Oct;22(4):8.

Cuba has one of the fastest aging populations in Latin America and the Caribbean 
(20.4% of the population aged ≥60 years by 2018) and life expectancy has climbed 
to nearly 79 years. This demographic shift has prompted a number of initiatives 
to address the needs of older adults and promote active, healthy longevity. At 
the community level in Cienfuegos Province, an educational program was 
implemented designed to foster a more active role in society for older adults 
and improve their quality of life upon retirement, as well as to reinforce a 
positive culture of aging. The program ran from June 2010 to June 2018 in the 
Mental Health Department of the Dr Enrique Barnet Polyclinic in the Santa Isabel 
de las Lajas Municipality. Twenty-two groups were constituted of 330 older 
adults who were trained for 10 weeks in techniques of self-awareness, personal 
growth, develop-ment of social skills, use of social support networks, adoption 
of healthy lifestyles and formulation of retirement plans. Results were assessed 
for each group one year after program completion and the information summarized. 
Participants whose defi nitions of "older adult" and "retirement" were rooted in 
nondiscriminatory concepts increased from 53 to 303 and re-tirees not 
incorporated into active social/economic life decreased from 228 to 36. At the 
outset, only 22% had coping mechanisms to manage their new role as retirees and 
9% had a life plan for retirement. One year after fi nishing the program, 318 
(96%) reported they were prepared to face this new stage in their lives and 294 
(89%) had completed life plans; at the start, 116 (35%) were taking 
antidepressants and one year later, 103 of them had reduced or eliminated the 
drugs. The program enriched participants' culture of aging, as well as 
relationships with their families and their communities. KEYWORDS Retirement,

Vaccinations: Mandatory or Voluntary? Risk-Benefit Analysis.

Socol Y(1), Shaki YY(1).

Author information:
(1)Jerusalem College of Technology, Jerusalem, Israel.

The discussion regarding mandatory vaccination of children centers mainly around 
the question of whether producing public good has precedence over the freedom of 
individuals. In the core of this discussion lies the assumption that mass 
immunization has been proven as a public good, based on the experts' opinion 
that there is no proof of significant damage caused by vaccinations. We suggest, 
however, that this argument is insufficient. Namely, beside acute effects, 
vaccination (as any intervention) can shorten long-term life expectancy. If, for 
example, vaccination is intended to prevent an illness that causes 0.05% 
mortality or permanent disability population-wide (like in the case of measles), 
the population-wide vaccination can be considered as a public good only if the 
vaccination itself does not cause life shortening by 0.05%, that is, by about 15 
days. Absence of such a small long-term effect has not been proven and cannot be 
proven in principle for several decades to come. The lack of proof of damage is 
not proof of lack of damage; in any dispute, the burden of proof lies with those 
who lay charges. Therefore, we conclude that it is inappropriate today to 
enforce mandatory immunization.

BACKGROUND: In addition to generally high levels of physical activity, 
multi-component exercise training is recommended for the maintenance of health 
and fitness in older adults, including the prevention of falls and frailty. This 
training often encompasses serial sequencing of balance, strength, endurance and 
other types of exercise. Exercise training featuring integrative training of 
these components (i.e. agility training) has been proposed, as it more likely 
reflects real life challenges like stop-and-go patterns, cutting manoeuvers, 
turns and decision-making. In this study, we compared the efficacy of an 
agility-based training to the traditional strength and balance training approach 
with regard to selected risk factors for falls and frailty.
METHODS: We trained twenty-seven community-dwelling healthy seniors (16♂; 11♀; 
age: 69.5 ± 5.3 y; BMI: 26.4 ± 3.7 kg/m2) for 8 weeks in a group setting with 3 
sessions per week, each lasting 50 minutes. Participants were randomized into 
either the agility group (AGI; n = 12), that used the integrative 
multi-component training, or the traditional strength and balance group (TSB; 
n = 15). TSB performed balance and strength exercises separately, albeit within 
the same session. The training of both groups progressively increased in 
difficulty. Outcomes were static and dynamic balance (single leg eyes open 
stand, Y-balance test, reactive balance), lower limb (plantar flexion and dorsal 
extension) and trunk flexion and extension maximum strength and rate of torque 
development (RTD). In addition, we tested endurance by the six-minute walk test 
(6MWT). We calculated linear mixed effects models for between-groups comparisons 
as well as effect sizes (ES) with 95 % confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Small ES in favor of AGI were found for plantar flexion strength (ES > 
0.18[-0.27;0.89]) and RTD (ES > 0.43[-0.19;1.36]) as well as trunk extension RTD 
(ES = 0.35[-0.05;0.75]). No other parameters showed notable between group 
differences. Compliance was high in both groups (AGI: 90 ± 8% of sessions; TSB: 
91 ± 7% of sessions).
DISCUSSION: Agility-based exercise training seems at least as efficacious as 
traditional strength and balance training in affecting selected physical 
performance indicators among community-dwelling healthy seniors. In particular, 
lower limb and trunk extension explosive strength seem to benefit from the 
agility training.
