OBJECTIVE: To examine the responsiveness of quality of life (QoL) associated 
with changes in clinical indices relevant to GH deficiency (GHD) in Japanese 
hypopituitary adults.
DESIGN AND METHODS: QoL was determined using the Short Form (SF)-36 in Japanese 
adults with adult-(AO; n = 27) or childhood- (CO; n = 37) onset GHD in a 24-week 
double-blind placebo-controlled study with a fixed GH dose, and a subsequent 
48-week open-label extension study with GH doses individualized using serum 
IGF-I levels.
RESULTS: Baseline QoL was significantly decreased from the Japanese national 
reference in both onset types, more so in AO patients. Throughout the study, AO 
patients showed a trend for an increase in physical functioning and general 
health (P = 0.0564 and 0.0999 respectively), whereas CO patients showed no 
changes in these domains. Fat mass changes negatively correlated with the 
changes in physical functioning and general health in AO patients (r = -0.42 and 
-0.64 respectively), but to a lesser degree in CO patients (r = -0.36 and -0.32 
respectively). CO patients displayed significant decreases in social functioning 
(P = 0.0305) and mental health (P = 0.0442) and a decreasing trend in bodily 
pain (P = 0.0769), although no correlation between these decreases and any 
measured clinical index was observed, except between changes in bodily pain and 
IGF-I levels (r = -0.43).
CONCLUSIONS: QoL impairment was evident in Japanese adults with GHD, 
particularly in AO patients. In AO patients, general health and physical 
functioning domains were responsive to fat mass changes during GH treatment; 
this association was not evident in CO patients. These relationships between QoL 
and body composition warrant verification.

decreased objective physical performance among Japanese community-dwelling 
elderly.

Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan. kwounjh@hanmail.net

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that serum albumin or vitamin D is 
associated with physical performance. We hypothesized that older adults with 
concomitant lower serum albumin and vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25OHD) 
levels are associated with decreased physical performance compared to those with 
1 or none of the 2 risk factors.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of combined serum albumin and 25OHD 
levels with physical performance (muscle strength and balance capability) in 
community-dwelling elderly.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study in a community-based population in the province 
of Tokyo, Japan, was performed. For the study, 1,094 community-dwelling people 
aged 70 and older underwent an interview, anthropometric measurements, blood 
analysis and physical performance testing. The subjects were classified into 4 
types by combining serum albumin and 25OHD levels: lower albumin only, lower 
vitamin D only, lower albumin and lower vitamin D, higher albumin and higher 
vitamin D.
RESULTS: Men with concomitant lower albumin and lower 25OHD levels had 
significantly decreased knee extension power, usual timed Up & Go and maximal 
timed Up & Go, even after adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI). In women, 
concomitant lower albumin and lower vitamin D was associated with significantly 
decreased handgrip strength and functional reach, even after adjusting for age 
and BMI. Subjects with combined lower albumin and lower vitamin D levels showed 
a significant decline in muscle strength and balance capability compared to 
higher albumin and higher vitamin D, even after adjusting for age, current 
drinking or smoking status, physical activity, history of chronic disease, basic 
activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, BMI and 
bone mineral density.
CONCLUSION: Concomitant lower serum albumin and lower vitamin D levels are 
associated with decreased muscle strength and balance capability in both men and 
women. These results suggest that serum albumin and 25OHD together may be an 
important target for strategies aiming to achieve a healthy life and prevent 
loss of independence in community-dwelling elderly.

Expectancy challenges (ECs) were used to change alcohol expectancies and alcohol 
consumption in young heavy drinking men (age 16-24) on holiday. The intervention 
took place in community centers and bars. Alcohol expectancies and consumption 
were assessed with paper and pencil measures prior to the intervention (N=301) 
and 2 days afterwards (EC: n=178; controls: n=86). Six weeks after the EC, 
participants were interviewed by telephone (EC: n=163; controls: n=71). The 
intervention resulted in an increase in sedation expectancies in the EC group. 
Furthermore, the EC led to a differential reduction in alcohol consumption on a 
night out at the six-week posttest in the heaviest drinkers only. The reduction 
in alcohol consumption on a night out was not mediated by the change in sedation 
expectancies. These findings suggest that further research on the mechanisms of 
change is necessary before a single-session EC may be used in a real-life 
prevention setting.

Raffaele, Milan, Italy.

AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic impact of the 
introduction of positron emission tomography (PET) in the clinical management of 
patients with known or suspected lung cancer through a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of different diagnostic strategies.
METHODS: In Italy, 75 patients with known or suspected lung cancer were included 
in the study. Three different diagnostic strategies were compared: 1) baseline 
or traditional strategy, i.e. computed tomography (CT) alone; 2) strategy A, 
i.e. PET for indefinite CT; 3) strategy B, i.e. PET for all. For each strategy 
expected costs and life expectancy, as measured by life year saved (LYS), were 
evaluated. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to 
identify the most effective strategy.
RESULTS: Compared to the baseline strategy, the introduction of PET changed the 
clinical management in 40% of cases in strategy A and in 51% of cases in 
strategy B, with an optimization of the clinical management. Costs of strategy A 
(2735.42 Euro) and strategy B (2984.52 Euro) were, respectively, 8% and 18% 
higher than the baseline strategy (2534.81 Euro). LYS was 2.04 and 2.64 for 
strategy A and B, which were, respectively, 4% and 35% higher than the baseline 
strategy (1.96 LYS). The ICERs were 2507.63 Euro/LYS and 415.17 Euro/LYS for 
strategy A and B, respectively. Strategy A is dominated by strategy B, which is 
more expensive, but also more effective.
CONCLUSION: In Italy, the introduction of PET in the clinical management of all 
patients with known or suspected lung cancer previously evaluated with CT is 
cost-effective and allows to gain 2.64 life years at an annual cost of about 415 
Euro.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes coronary heart, cerebrovascular, 
and peripheral vascular disease, is the leading cause of death in the United 
States and most developed countries, accounting for about 50% of all deaths. The 
major risk factors include obesity and its consequences, dyslipidemia, 
hypertension, insulin resistance leading to diabetes, and cigarette smoking. In 
developing countries, CVD will become the leading cause of death due to alarming 
increases in obesity, sedentary lifestyles, cigarette smoking, and improvements 
in prevention and treatment of malnutrition and infection. Compared with 
nonschizophrenics, patients with schizophrenia have a 20% shorter life 
expectancy (i.e., from 76 to 61 years). In general populations, about 1% die 
from suicide compared with about 10% among patients with schizophrenia (relative 
risk = 10). For CVD, the corresponding figures are 50% and about 75% (relative 
risk = 1.5). In patients with schizophrenia, however, CVD occurs more frequently 
and accounts for more premature deaths than suicide. Patients with schizophrenia 
have alarmingly higher rates of obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, 
and cigarette smoking than nonschizophrenic individuals in the general 
population. Compounding these data, patients with schizophrenia have less access 
to medical care, consume less medical care, and are less compliant. Primary 
prevention strategies should include the choice of antipsychotic drug regimens 
that do not adversely affect the major risk factors for CVD.

surface.

BACKGROUND: Conventionally, endosseous dental implants have required 3 to 6 
months of uninterrupted healing based on observations for dental implants that 
were characterized by a relatively smooth machined surface. Many studies have 
since demonstrated that implants with a roughened surface resulted in greater 
bone apposition, earlier bone contact, and a stronger bond between the implant 
and the bone, suggesting that implants with roughened surfaces could be loaded 
earlier than 3 to 6 months. Formal clinical studies confirmed that implants with 
rough surfaces can have abutments placed and be loaded occlusally as early as 6 
weeks postplacement. The purpose of this prospective, human clinical 
investigation was to evaluate a large number of implants with a specific rough 
surface (sand-blasted acid-etched [SLA]) placed in everyday practice under 
routine private-practice conditions.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, human clinical observational study was 
initiated with the goal of recruiting a minimum of 500 patients and 800 
implants. The implants were to be placed and restored in predominantly 
private-practice settings around the world. Ninety-two practitioners in 16 
countries agreed to participate, and 86 followed the study design. Patients had 
to be in good health, have sufficient bone to encase the implant, and agree to 
return for recall appointments. Exclusion criteria included heavy smoking (>10 
cigarettes a day) and bone augmentation procedures at the implant site. All 
implants were two-piece (an abutment was to be placed after 6 weeks of healing) 
and were characterized by the presence of a transmucosal polished collar. Each 
implant had an SLA surface. All implants were positioned using a non-submerged 
(single-stage) surgical technique. Survival and success rates were calculated by 
life-table analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 706 patients were enrolled and 1,406 implants were placed. 
In the final analyses, 590 patients with 990 implants (70.4% of those enrolled) 
met all inclusion criteria, including placement of an abutment and provisional 
restoration within 63 days of surgical placement. The majority of implants were 
10 and 12 mm long (78.7%) and were placed in type II and III bone (87%). 
Seventy-three percent of the implants were placed in the mandible, and 27% were 
placed in the maxilla. The cumulative survival rate was 99.56% at 3 years and 
99.26% at 5 years. The overall success rate was 99.12% at 3 years and 97.38% 
after 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Under private-practice conditions, implants with an SLA surface 
could be placed and restored predictably within 6 to 8 weeks. Data from this 
prospective, multicenter, human observational study reinforced the results of 
more formal clinical studies and demonstrated that implants with the SLA surface 
can be restored in patients in approximately half of the time of conventional 
healing periods.

Peginterferon alfa-2a versus peginterferon alfa-2b as initial treatment of 
hepatitis C virus infection: a cost-utility analysis from the perspective of the

Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-utility of peginterferon alfa-2a plus 
ribavirin, peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, and no therapy for 
treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection from the 
perspective of the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system by using 
patient-reported utility scores.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using a Markov model.
SETTING: Veterans Affairs health care system.
DATA SOURCE: Data for the model were obtained from clinical trials and published 
literature. Data from the VA health care system were used to define the patient 
cohorts.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A Markov model incorporating transition 
probabilities between disease health states that depend only on the current 
health state was developed to simulate the progression of HCV disease. The 
patient cohorts were a 45-year-old male cohort and a 55-year-old male cohort, 
each with liver fibrosis but no cirrhosis. The lifetime expected costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental net monetary benefit 
(INMB) with HCV treatments were determined for each cohort by genotype (genotype 
1, and genotypes 2 and 3). Both peginterferon regimens were significantly more 
cost-effective than no treatment, although no significant differences in costs 
or QALYs were noted between peginterferon regimens. For the 45-year-old cohort 
with a genotype 1 infection, the INMB was $128,583 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
$79,279-$177,308) and $128,025 (95% CI $80,425-$173,448) versus no treatment for 
peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, 
respectively. Treatment with either peginterferon regimen produced significantly 
lower lifetime HCV-related medical costs for genotype 2 or 3 infections, but not 
genotype 1.
CONCLUSIONS: Peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2b plus 
ribavirin were found to be cost-effective treatments for patients with HCV 
infections, particularly with genotypes 2 and 3. However, no significant 
differences in costs or efficacy were observed between these peginterferon 
treatment regimens.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the preferred approach to superficial femoral artery 
(SFA) revascularization of Trans-Atlantic Inter-Societal Consensus (TASC) B and 
C lesions in claudicants requiring intervention based on a review of published 
data.
DESIGN: Decision analysis, Markov state transition model.
SUBJECTS: Hypothetical cohorts of claudicants with TASC B or TASC C superficial 
femoral artery lesions considered candidates for either angioplasty with 
selective stenting (PTA/S) or greater saphenous vein bypass (GSVB).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: For a 65-year-old man with disabling claudication, percutaneous 
transluminal angioplasty and selective stenting (PTA/S) was preferred over GSVB 
for a TASC B SFA lesion. In an otherwise identical patient with a TASC C lesion, 
bypass was the preferred therapy. Treating PTA/S failures with subsequent bypass 
increased the utility of PTA/S but bypass remained the preferred initial therapy 
for TASC C lesions. Sensitivity analysis showed that PTA/S surpasses bypass 
efficacy for TASC C lesions if PTA/S primary patency is >32% at 5 years, patient 
age is >80 years, or GSVB operative mortality is >6%.
CONCLUSION: PTA/S is the preferred initial therapy over GSVB for TASC B SFA 
lesions in patients with disabling intermittent claudication who require 
intervention. Given contemporary published outcomes for TASC C lesions, GSVB is 
the preferred therapy in operative candidates. In elderly patients or patients 
at high risk for bypass, PTA/S should be considered over GSVB. Improved 
technology that results in a 5-year primary patency of 32% would also justify 
PTA/S for TASC C SFA lesions.

The "grandmother hypothesis" proposes that menopause evolved because ancestral 
middle-aged women gained greater reproductive success from investing in extant 
genetic relatives than from continuing to reproduce [Williams GC. Pleiotropy, 
natural selection, and the evolution of senescence. Evolution 1957;11:398-411]. 
Because middle-aged women faced greater risks of maternal death during pregnancy 
and their offspring's infancy than did younger women, offspring of middle-aged 
women may not have received the needed level of prolonged maternal investment to 
survive to reproductive age. I put forward the "absent father hypothesis" 
proposing that reduced paternal investment linked with increasing maternal age 
was an additional impetus for the evolution of menopause. Reduced paternal 
investment was linked with increasing maternal age because men died at a younger 
age than their mates and because some men were increasingly likely to defect 
from their mateships as their mates aged. The absent father hypothesis is not an 
alternative to the grandmother hypothesis but rather a complement. It outlines 
an additional cost--reduced paternal investment--associated with continued 
reproduction by ancestral middle-aged women that could have been an additional 
impetus for the evolution of menopause. After reviewing additional explanations 
for the origin of menopause ("patriarch hypothesis," "lifespan-artifact" 
hypotheses), I close by proposing a novel hypothesis for the ontogeny of 
menopause. According to the "adaptive onset hypothesis," the developmental 
timing of menopause is a conditional reproductive strategy in which a woman's 
age at onset is influenced by the likelihood that any children she could produce 
would survive to reproductive age. Twelve variables predicted to be associated 
with age at onset and evidence that bears upon the predictions is discussed.

Risk assessment in diabetes management: how do general practitioners estimate 
risks due to diabetes?

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the ability of general practitioners (GPs) in Germany to 
estimate the risk of patients with diabetes developing complications.
METHODS: An interview study using a structured questionnaire to estimate risks 
of four case vignettes having diabetes-specific complications within the next 10 
years, risk reduction and life expectancy potential. A representative random 
sample of 584 GPs has been drawn, of which 150 could be interviewed. We compared 
GPs' estimates among each other (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 
Cohen's (multirater-) kappa) and with risks for long-term complications 
generated by the multifactor disease model "Mellibase", which is a 
knowledge-based support system for medical decision management.
RESULTS: The risk estimates by GPs varied widely (ICC 0.21 95% CI (0.13 to 
0.36)). The average level of potential risk reduction was between 47% and 70%. 
Compared with Mellibase values, on average, the GPs overestimated the risk 
threefold. Mean estimates of potential prolongation of life expectancy were 
close to 10 years for each patient, whereas the Mellibase calculations ranged 
from 3 to 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Overestimation could lead to unnecessary care and waste of 
resources.

The authors recently introduced a new preference-based scoring function for the 
EQ-5D (D1 model) based on time tradeoff valuations from the general adult US 
population: In this study, they compared the EQ-5D index scores derived from the 
US (D1) algorithm to the more familiar UK (N3) algorithm. They compared 
preference-based EQ-5D index scores for all possible EQ-5D health states and 
differences in EQ-5D index scores between pairs of EQ-5D health states predicted 
by the D1 and N3 models. The responsiveness of D1- and N3-predicted EQ-5D index 
scores was assessed using simulated transitions between EQ-5D health states. The 
mean (SD) EQ-5D index scores for all 243 health states predicted by the D1 and 
N3 models were 0.37 (0.23) and 0.14 (0.31), respectively. The mean (SD) absolute 
difference in EQ-5D index scores for all 29,403 pairs of health states was 0.25 
(0.19) and 0.35 (0.27), according to the D1 and N3 models, respectively. The D1 
and N3 models were consistent in predicting gains/losses for 27,592 (94%) 
transitions between EQ-5D health state pairs; Cohen effect size, calculated 
using these 27,592 consistent transitions, was 1.58 and 1.59 for the D1 and N3 
models, respectively. Based on these simulation results, it appears that the D1 
model would lead to smaller gains in quality-adjusted life years than the N3 
model; however, their responsiveness appears to be similar. Empirical studies 
are needed to examine whether these 2 EQ-5D scoring functions would lead to 
different conclusions in cost-utility analyses.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of adalimumab vs 
conventional therapy in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
METHODS: The analysis was based on pooled data from two Phase III studies of 
adalimumab in active AS. Patients with an inadequate response to >/=1 NSAID 
received adalimumab 40 mg every other week (n = 246) or placebo (n = 151) for 24 
weeks. A microsimulation model was developed with patients being treated with 
adalimumab according to the International ASAS Consensus Statement and BSR 
guidelines. The pooled adalimumab data, as well as data from the Outcome 
Assessment in AS International Study (OASIS) database and the literature, were 
used to model patients' BASDAI and BASFI scores and costs and health-related 
quality of life associated with various degrees of disease activity. Costs (in 
2004 British pound) of AS, drug, administration, monitoring, hospitalization and 
AEs were calculated from the perspective of the UK NHS. Discounting was applied 
at 3.5% per year for costs and benefits as per the NICE reference case for 
economic evaluations. Uncertainty was addressed via sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adalimumab vs 
conventional therapy was estimated to improve with longer time horizons (48 
weeks to 5 and 30 yrs). The central estimate was that, over 30 yrs, adalimumab 
therapy yielded 1.03 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient 
initiating therapy. Some AS treatment-related costs were estimated to be offset 
by adalimumab (at 10,750 pounds/patient), leaving a total incremental cost 
(adalimumab vs conventional therapy) at 23,857 pounds per patient. The 30-yr 
ICER of adalimumab vs conventional therapy was estimated at 23 pounds 097/QALY. 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness of results. When indirect costs 
were also included (analysis from societal perspective), ICER improved to 5093 
pounds/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates that adalimumab, when used according to UK 
treatment guidelines, is cost-effective vs conventional therapy for treating AS 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Optimal resource allocation for antiretroviral treatment (ART) in 
developing countries requires assessment of different strategies for drug 
treatment and laboratory monitoring.
OBJECTIVES: To compare costs and outcomes for 10 000 simulated HIV-infected 
patients followed every 6 months for 10 years in a limited-resource setting.
METHOD: Five nested strategies, with and without the availability of a 
second-line treatment regimen, were simulated: (a) no ART (NO ART); (b) with ART 
but without any laboratory markers of HIV other than positive serology (ART 
ONLY); (c) ART plus total lymphocyte count (TLC); (d) ART plus CD4 cell counts 
(CD4); and (e) ART plus CD4 cell count plus viral load measurement (VL). 
Baseline prices of CD4 cell count and viral load measurements were $5.00 and 
$25.00 per test, respectively.
RESULTS: With no second-line treatment available, treating 10 000 patients with 
ART ONLY compared with NO ART would cost $14.49 million [95% confidence interval 
(CI), 14.45-14.52] and would generate an additional 23 060 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYS) (95% CI, 22 770-23 360) for a median incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $628/QALY. Median ICER values per QALY for CD4 and 
VL strategies are $238 and $16 139, respectively, when second-line treatment is 
unavailable. With second-line ART available, the corresponding median ICER 
values are $8636, and $14 670.
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of second-line ART, the CD4 strategy is a more 
cost-effective laboratory testing strategy for managing HIV infection than 
either TLC or VL. Availability of second-line ART plus CD4 cell count and/or 
viral load measurement would save additional lives, but at high incremental 
cost.

Palermo, Palermo, Italy. terapiadeldolore@la-maddalena.it

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines recent data on the pathophysiology and 
mechanisms of bone pain; it highlights the use of multiple and interdisciplinary 
treatments rather than sole use of traditional analgesics.
RECENT FINDINGS: Bone pain has been shown to have a unique pathophysiology. 
Recent experimental (animal) models have revealed that, parallel to increased 
bone destruction, ipsilateral spinal cord segments that receive primary input 
from the cancerous femur exhibit several notable neurochemical changes. These 
mandate the use of opioid doses sufficient to inhibit the observed nociceptive 
behaviours; these doses are greater than those required to alleviate pain 
behaviours of comparable magnitude generated by inflammatory pain. Several 
substances have been tested in this animal model.
SUMMARY: According to new preclinical data, treatment of bone cancer pain 
requires multidisciplinary therapies such as radiotherapy applied to the painful 
area along with systemic treatment (hormone therapy or chemotherapy) and 
supportive care (analgesic therapy and bisphosphonates). In some selected cases 
use of radioisotopes and other noninvasive or minimally invasive techniques may 
be useful in the management of metastatic bone pain. The treatment should be 
individualized according to the patient's clinical condition, life expectancy, 
and quality of life.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate signaling from extracellular ligands 
to intracellular signal transduction proteins. Methuselah (Mth) is a class B 
(secretin-like) GPCR, a family typified by their large, ligand-binding, 
N-terminal extracellular domains. Downregulation of mth increases the life span 
of Drosophila melanogaster; inhibitors of Mth signaling should therefore enhance 
longevity. We used mRNA display selection to identify high-affinity (K(d) = 15 
to 30 nM) peptide ligands that bind to the N-terminal ectodomain of Mth. The 
selected peptides are potent antagonists of Mth signaling, and structural 
studies suggest that they perturb the interface between the Mth ecto- and 
transmembrane domains. Flies constitutively expressing a Mth antagonist peptide 
have a robust life span extension, which suggests that the peptides inhibit Mth 
signaling in vivo. Our work thus provides new life span-extending ligands for a 
metazoan and a general approach for the design of modulators of this important 
class of GPCRs.

Cardiologia da UFRGS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. carisi@terra.com.br

OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness ratios of sirolimus-eluting stents 
(SES) with bare-metal stents (BMS) under two perspectives: the "supplementary 
medical system" (health plans and private patients) and the public health (SUS) 
system.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model using three different therapeutic strategies 
for coronary lesions: percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with BMS; with 
SES; or with BMS followed by SES to treat symptomatic restenosis. Study 
endpoints were one-year event-free survival and life expectancy. Decision trees 
were constructed using the results of published registries and clinical trials.
RESULTS: One-year restenosis-free survival was 92.7% with SES and 78.8% with 
BMS. Estimated life expectancy was very similar for all the strategies, ranging 
from 18.5 to 19 years. Under a nonpublic perspective, the cost difference in the 
first year between BMS and SES was R$3,816, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of R$27,403 per event avoided in one year. Under the 
SUS perspective, the cost per event avoided in one year was R$47,529. In the 
sensitivity analysis, probability of restenosis, risk reduction expected with 
SES, the price of the stent and cost of treating restenosis were all important 
predictors. In the Monte Carlo simulation, data per years of life saved showed 
very high cost-effectiveness ratios.
CONCLUSION: In the Brazilian model, the cost-effectiveness ratios for SES were 
elevated. The use of SES was more favorable for patients with high risk of 
restenosis, as it is associated with elevated costs in restenosis management of 
and under a nonpublic perspective.

Determination of the elemental composition of trace analytes in complex matrices 
using exact masses of product ions and corresponding neutral losses.

Zürich), P.O. Box, CH-8030 Zürich, Switzerland. anton.kaufmann@klzh.ch

The emergence of time-of-flight (TOF) and hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight 
(Q-TOF) mass spectrometers has offered new possibilities for determining the 
elemental composition of analytes present at trace levels. The mass accuracy 
provided by these instruments is currently in the range of 2-5 m m/z units, 
permitting the determination of the elemental composition of small molecules. 
The orthogonal information of relative isotopic abundances (RIAs) is used to 
reduce the number of elemental compositions that are possible, based on 
consideration of exact masses. Elimination of additional possible compositions 
has been reported when the analyte is fragmented and its resulting product ions 
and corresponding neutral losses are carefully analyzed. Published algorithms 
reduce the number of proposed precursor ions by deleting each precursor 
candidate which cannot be explained by summing any combination of postulated 
product ion and corresponding neutral loss elemental composition candidates. An 
extension of such algorithms is described in this paper. This approach compares 
not only the precursor ion with the different fragments, but tests the possible 
descent of any ion from all other recorded ions. This extended algorithm has 
been tested by processing published data. Algorithms analyzing product ion 
spectra can be used for real-life data. However, there is a risk that an ion 
which originates from the mobile phase or from a co-eluting matrix compound can 
be mathematically correlated to the investigated precursor ion. Such an 
incorrect correlation can lead to the deletion of a correct elemental 
composition. This is an important issue if TOF rather than Q-TOF instruments are 
used. Therefore, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and a peak 
deconvolution algorithm were used to generate and process TOF chromatograms in 
order to minimize the number of ions which are not related to the analyte 
precursor ion. The combined use of chromatographic deconvolution and product ion 
spectra has been tested and is critically discussed.

The considerable progress that has been made in the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
has significantly increased life expectancy. The multi-disciplinary approach is 
now considered to be a priority by centers providing care for adults with cystic 
fibrosis. The aim of this study was to investigate three psychological 
morbidities that are commonly present with this disease: depression, anxiety and 
poor coping mechanisms for stress. Sixteen subjects (aged 19 to 37 years) 
participated in this study and were divided in three groups according to the 
severity of their pulmonary disease. Assessments of depression and anxiety were 
made from two perspectives: 1) the subject's own perception of his/her 
depressive and anxious state; 2) a psychologist's assessment of the patients 
depressive and anxious state. Then, reactions to stress were explored by 
analyzing "coping" strategies employed. Results indicate that patients 
underestimated the level of their depressive and anxious state when compared to 
the psychologists assessment. The majority of them exhibited "coping" strategies 
based on emotional responses. Levels of anxiety and depression did not show any 
relationship with the severity of pulmonary disease suggesting that the major 
determinant of emotional well-being lies with the individual's own perception of 
their state and of the support available to them.

Congenital hearing loss still remain an important medical and social problem for 
the delayed language development. Object of this study is to provide an updated 
and close estimate of the economic burden involved in pre-lingual hearing loss. 
Data were provided by the Ministry of Health data bank, the Ministry of 
Education national data bank, the National Institute of Social Insurance 
national data bank and the Italian Central Statistics Institute. The information 
was collected by means of a specially provided Societal Cost Questionnaire 
(SCQ). Direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs and indirect welfare costs 
involved in deafness were included in the cost estimate. Was enrolled in the 
study a sample of subjects with pre-lingual deafness, with a mean bilateral 
neuro-sensorial hearing impairment equal to 60 dB or more for 500, 1,000 and 
2,000 Hz frequency tones in the better ear detected in neonatal age, had 
prevented speech from developing. The statistical assessment was performed 
according to an actuarial approach, considering the estimated life expectancy at 
birth, based on updated population data from census 2001. Based on life 
expectancy, the lifetime mean cost assessed for a subject affected by profound 
pre-lingual deafness turned out to be equal to Euro 737,994.76 for a male and 
Euro 755,404.02 for a female. Unlike other disabling affections, deafness weighs 
significantly more on the social system than on the health system. As a matter 
of fact, the direct medical costs, such as audiological diagnosis, hearing aids, 
etc., only account for 3.8% of the societal cost, whereas education, 
rehabilitation and welfare costs reach 96.2% of the total. Finally, our results 
suggest that societal costs can only be reduced by zeroing in on promotion and 
broadening of effective prevention strategies. The appropriate public health 
measures (such as the universal newborn hearing screening) set up and 
implemented in several European and non-European countries proved effective and 
reduced the handicap degree resulting from deafness. The investment in 
prevention will be widely paid.

practices in Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Various organizations have published clinical practice guidelines 
for the care of haemodialysis patients. However, it is unknown to what extent 
improving or even reaching perfect compliance with guidelines would improve the 
survival of HD patients in Belgium.
METHODS: Using data from the second phase of the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice 
Patterns Study (DOPPS), the proportion of haemodialysis patients failing to meet 
six key practice targets (Kt/V > or = 1.2, haemoglobin > or =11 g/dl, phosphate 
1.1-1.5 mmol/l, calcium 2.1-2, 4 mmol/l, albumin > or =40 g/l, and facility 
catheter use < or =10%) was calculated along with the relative risk of mortality 
associated with being outside these targets. The life years potentially gained 
from adherence to the six targets, both separately and all six together were 
then estimated.
RESULTS: The percentage of patients outside the targets were as follows: 30.3%, 
Kt/V; 33.6%, haemoglobin; 56.2%, phosphate; 58.2%, calcium; 67.1%, albumin; and 
91.1%, catheter. Estimated patient life years gained with improved compliance 
with guidelines was highest for albumin (3.670) and catheter use (2.331) but 
still substantial for the other four targets (ranging from 551 to 1.258). The 
total of patient years gained if 100% of patients have all six practices brought 
within target reaches 7.516 years. A conservative estimate of 50% of patients 
within all targets still yields an improvement of survival of 3.958 patient 
years.
CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests large opportunities to improve HD patient 
care in Belgium. The avoidance of HD catheters, with the use of AV fistulas 
whenever possible, should be given a high priority. Admittedly, these 
calculations assume causality or partial causality that has not been 
definitively proven. Still, if causality is only partial, the results emphasize 
that the improvement of patient care through adherence to targets of clinical 
guidelines might be substantial and all Belgian nephrologists and staff members 
of dialysis units should carefully pursue every potential effort.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease that is 
predominantly seen in the Caucasian population and involves multiple organs. 
Traditionally it has been thought that the kidney is the only organ which does 
not seem to be generally affected by the disease although the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is expressed in the kidney.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of an 11 year old boy with cystic fibrosis 
and nephrotic syndrome and review the literature that describes nephrotic 
syndrome and renal involvement in cystic fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: With continued advances in the management of cystic fibrosis and 
improvement in life expectancy, several unrecognized co-morbidities are expected 
to emerge. It is important to screen patients for possible co-morbidities. Urine 
analysis may be helpful in this group of patients and any proteinuria should 
raise the suspicion of cystic fibrosis-related renal disease.

Pharmacoeconomics and quality of life of current and emerging biologic therapies 
for inflammatory bowel disease.

The development of biologic therapies for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis 
has profoundly affected the treatment of these diseases. The impact of these 
novel therapies has been tremendous in terms of their ability to cause clinical 
improvement in symptoms and endoscopic and histologic evidence of healing, as 
well as improvements in quality of life. However, the success of these new 
remedies comes with a significant price tag. In the current cost-containment 
environment of health care, it is essential to evaluate the impact of these 
novel and promising therapies on health care resource utilization, employment 
productivity, and quality of life. Despite the high cost of these new 
medications, they may result in a net cost savings through their ability to 
induce remission in the sickest of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, 
thereby averting the large expenditures associated with hospitalization and 
surgery. Likewise, by improving patients' physical symptoms, emotional 
well-being, and quality of life, biologic agents have the potential to reduce 
much of the unemployment, missed work, and disability through which IBD patients 
suffer. In a disease with an early age of onset and a chronic course with normal 
life expectancy, reducing morbidity and improving quality of life should be 
important measures of treatment success. Biologic therapies for IBD hold 
significant promise in this regard, allowing clinicians to achieve lasting 
remission in patients who are unresponsive to conventional therapies. Comparison 
of the costs and benefits of biologic therapies with conventional treatments for 
IBD is complicated by the need to assess the downstream effects of an 
intervention. For example, corticosteroids are inexpensive and very effective 
for induction of remission, but they come with significant long-term 
complications, such as osteoporosis, cataracts, impaired glucose tolerance, and 
poor wound healing, which must be taken into account when assessing their true 
cost as a maintenance medication. We do not yet have enough experience with 
biologic therapies to evaluate their potential to prevent or create future costs 
associated with adverse effects. However, as we move forward with our knowledge 
of biologic agents, an understanding of the economic and quality-of-life 
implications of these innovative therapies is crucial for patients, clinicians, 
and third-party payers alike.

Western Reserve University, 11100 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106-5047, USA.

Patients with metastatic disease from colorectal cancer are now living twice as 
long as they were one decade ago. With this increasing life expectancy, we are 
beginning to see these patients strive for an acceptable and improved quality of 
life. Medical advances have led to unanswered questions regarding the role of 
surgery in metastatic colorectal cancer. Despite the increasing application of 
laparoscopy for primary treatment of colorectal cancer, the appropriate role for 
laparoscopy in patients with stage IV disease has yet to be defined. This review 
addresses this topic and suggests treatment algorithms for patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer. While unresectable, metastatic colorectal cancer 
remains incurable at the current time, continued advances will inevitably 
challenge this presumption and it is crucial to outline the role of laparoscopy 
in this patient population.

Inhalational anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease of considerable 
concern, especially because anthrax is an emerging bioterrorism agent. The exact 
mechanisms leading to a severe clinical form through the inhalational route are 
still unclear, particularly how immobile spores are captured in the alveoli and 
transported to the lymph nodes in the early steps of infection. We investigated 
the roles of alveolar macrophages and lung dendritic cells (LDC) in spore 
migration. We demonstrate that alveolar macrophages are the first cells to 
phagocytose alveolar spores, and do so within 10 min. However, interstitial LDCs 
capture spores present in the alveoli within 30 min without crossing the 
epithelial barrier suggesting a specific mechanism for rapid alveolus sampling 
by transepithelial extension. We show that interstitial LDCs constitute the cell 
population that transports spores into the thoracic lymph nodes from within 30 
min to 72 h after intranasal infection. Our results demonstrate that LDCs are 
central to spore transport immediately after infection. The rapid kinetics of 
pathogen transport may contribute to the clinical features of inhalational 
anthrax.
