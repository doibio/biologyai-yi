BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the differences between the United States 
and the United Kingdom in the characteristics and posttransplant survival of 
patients who received donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver allografts 
from donors aged >60 y.
METHODS: Data were collected from the UK Transplant Registry and the United 
Network for Organ Sharing databases. Cohorts were dichotomized into donor age 
subgroups (donor >60 y [D >60]; donor ≤60 y [D ≤60]). Study period: January 1, 
2001, to December 31, 2015.
RESULTS: 1157 DCD LTs were performed in the United Kingdom versus 3394 in the 
United States. Only 13.8% of US DCD donors were aged >50 y, contrary to 44.3% in 
the United Kingdom. D >60 were 22.6% in the United Kingdom versus 2.4% in the 
United States. In the United Kingdom, 64.2% of D >60 clustered in 2 metropolitan 
centers. In the United States, there was marked inter-regional variation. A 
total of 78.3% of the US DCD allografts were used locally. One- and 5-y 
unadjusted DCD graft survival was higher in the United Kingdom versus the United 
States (87.3% versus 81.4%, and 78.0% versus 71.3%, respectively; P < 0.001). 
One- and 5-y D >60 graft survival was higher in the United Kingdom (87.3% versus 
68.1%, and 77.9% versus 51.4%, United Kingdom versus United States, 
respectively; P < 0.001). In both groups, grafts from donors ≤30 y had the best 
survival. Survival was similar for donors aged 41 to 50 versus 51 to 60 in both 
cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the United Kingdom, older DCD LT utilization remained 
low in the United States, with worse D >60 survival. Nonetheless, present data 
indicate similar survivals for older donors aged ≤60, supporting an extension to 
the current US DCD age cutoff.

INTRODUCTION: Trial-based, risk-targeted lung cancer screening with low-dose 
computed tomography has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality but 
implementation may depend on favourable cost-effectiveness evaluations where 
quality-adjusted life-years are a key metric. Baseline health utility values for 
a screening population at high risk of lung cancer are not likely to match 
age-specific population norms, and utilities derived from screening trials may 
not be representative of real-world screening populations. We estimated utility 
values for screening-eligible individuals in a population-based cohort study in 
Australia.
METHODS: Cancer-free participants aged 50-80 years in the New South Wales 45 and 
Up Study completed the 12-Item Short Form Survey (2010-2011). Mean SF-6D utility 
values were calculated for 19,991 participants and compared across screening 
criteria defined by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF-2021/2013), 
NELSON trial eligibility, and the PLCOm2012 risk tool.
RESULTS: Mean SF-6D utility values were comparable across screening criteria: 
USPSTF-2021, 0.772 (95%CI, 0.768-0.776); USPSTF-2013, 0.764 (95%CI, 
0.759-0.770); NELSON, 0.768 (95%CI, 0.763-0.774), and were each lower than among 
ineligible participants (0.810-0.814). While there was a decline in utilities 
with increasing risk of lung cancer as measured with the PLCOm2012 risk tool, 
mean utility values for those with ≥ 1.51% 6-year risk did not differ to other 
criteria (0.772, 95%CI, 0.767-0.776).
CONCLUSION: Risk criteria are necessary for the efficiency of lung cancer 
screening programs, but they select populations with lower mean health utilities 
than population norms. We provide baseline values that can be used in 
cost-effectiveness evaluations of risk-targeted lung cancer screening.

INTRODUCTION: With prolonged life expectancy, the number of patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) has 
substantially increased over the past years. The post-operative outcome and 
complications in SLE are less clearly understood than other inflammatory 
diseases, due to limited availability of evidence within the literature.
METHODS: Using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, patients who 
underwent THA between 2016 and 2019 were identified (ICD-10 CMP code). Patients 
were then classified into one of the two groups, namely those with SLE 
(ICD-10-CM; code710.0) or those without SLE (NSLE). Data regarding demographic 
details, co-morbidities, details regarding hospital stay, expenditure incurred, 
and complications encountered were analyzed, and compared between the groups.
RESULTS: Overall, among 367,894 patients undergoing THA, 1684 (0.5%) had SLE. 
Mean age of SLE (57.3 ± 14.5 years) patients undergoing THA was significantly 
lower than NSLE (65.9 ± 11.4 years) population (p = 0.001). There was a greater 
proportion of female patients in SLE group [89.6% (SLE) vs 55.8% (NSLE); 
p = 0.001]. SLE patients had a greater incidence of emergent hospital admissions 
(p = 0.04), longer hospital stay (p = 0.001), and higher hospital-related 
expenditure (p = 0.001). Among the peri-operative complications, SLE patients 
had significantly greater risk of developing post-operative anemia (p = 0.001), 
need for blood transfusion (p = 0.001), peri-prosthetic mechanical complications 
(p = 0.04), and prosthetic dislocations (p = 0.001). There was also a greater 
incidence of peri-prosthetic infections in the SLE group (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The presence of SLE significantly lengthens hospital stay and 
augments healthcare-related costs in patients undergoing THA. The three main 
complications which may significantly affect the post-operative course of these 
patients include higher rates of post-operative anemia, peri-prosthetic 
infections, and early prosthetic dislocations.

BACKGROUND: In relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R ALL), 
successive salvage therapies may worsen outcomes and decrease quality of life. 
This post hoc analysis of the phase III INO-VATE trial investigates subsequent 
salvage therapies and compared the time from randomization to first subsequent 
salvage therapy (TST) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) and standard-of-care 
chemotherapy (SoC) arms.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults (aged ≥18 years) with CD22+ R/R ALL were randomized 
to InO (n = 164) or SoC (n = 162) treatment. We determined TST and proportion of 
patients receiving subsequent salvage therapies by treatment arm and for 
subgroups based on transplantation status and baseline characteristics.
RESULTS: In the InO versus SoC arm, a smaller proportion of patients received 
subsequent salvage therapy (34.1% [n = 56] vs. 56.8% [n = 92]), and TST was 
longer (median 19 vs. 4 months, hazard ratio 0.339, P < .0001). Similar benefits 
were seen with InO versus SoC irrespective of transplantation status, age, 
salvage phase, first remission duration, Philadelphia chromosome status, or CD22 
expression. Following receipt of subsequent salvage therapy, median overall 
survival was 4 months, irrespective of treatment arm.
CONCLUSION: Patients in the InO versus SoC arm were less likely to receive 
subsequent salvage therapy, and showed a clinically meaningful extension of TST 
irrespective of subgroup. This suggests InO treatment leads to improved outcomes 
by increasing the likelihood that subsequent salvage therapies and their 
associated adverse impacts can be delayed or avoided.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of donafenib 
compared to sorafenib and lenvatinib as first-line treatments for patients with 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in China.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to estimate the clinical and 
economic outcomes of donafenib, sorafenib, and lenvatinib for advanced HCC. The 
key clinical data of these targeted therapies were assessed through a network 
meta-analysis. The cost and health utilities were mainly collected from the 
literature. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were the primary outcomes. Model uncertainty 
was tested with one-way sensitivity analyses, scenario analyses, and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA).
RESULTS: For health outcomes, donafenib gained the highest QALYs among the three 
treatments, followed by lenvatinib and sorafenib (1.106, 0.999, and 0.915 QALYs, 
respectively). For cost, donafenib was the cheapest option, followed by 
sorafenib and lenvatinib ($42,116, $43,193, and $44,261). The PSA indicated that 
the probability of being cost-effective for donafenib was 86.98% and 93.56% when 
the willingness-to-pay thresholds were one and three times the gross domestic 
product per capita in China, respectively. The one-way sensitivity analyses and 
scenario analyses also found the results to be robust.
CONCLUSION: Compared to sorafenib and lenvatinib, donafenib was likely to be a 
cost-effective treatment with the highest QALYs and the lowest cost for patients 
with advanced HCC in China.

Laser treatment has offered a relatively nonsurgical alternative for eye, life, 
and vision-sparing treatment of malignant melanoma of the choroid. Historically, 
the most commonly used forms of lasers were xenon-arc, argon laser, krypton 
laser, and the more recent transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) and photodynamic 
therapy (PDT). Melanomas selected for laser treatment tend to be smaller and 
visibly accessible, which means these tumors are usually located in the 
posterior choroid. Laser treatments have been associated with both local tumor 
destruction and side effects. Unlike radiation therapy, laser treatment has been 
commonly associated with retinal traction, hemorrhage, chorioretinal 
neovascularization, and extra scleral tumor extension, as well as higher rates 
of local treatment failure. In addition, however, laser-treatment has been 
successfully used to treat tumor-related retinal detachments, radiation 
retinopathy, and neovascular glaucoma. We review the world's experience of 
ophthalmic laser treatment for choroidal melanoma, offer safety and efficacy 
guidelines, as well as a comparison of laser treatment to radiation therapy 
outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To provide updated estimates of life expectancy at birth for 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in the Northern Territory, 1999-2018; to 
quantify the contributions of changes in life years lost to disease-specific 
causes of death to overall changes in life expectancy.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of Australian Coordinating Registry data 
on underlying and nine multiple causes of death (ICD-10) for deaths in the NT, 
by age, sex, and Indigenous status, 1 January 1999 - 31 December 2018.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth by year and 5-year period, by 
Indigenous status and sex; change in life expectancy by year and 5-year period, 
by Indigenous status and sex; contributions in changes in life years lost to 
leading underlying causes of death, by 5-year period, Indigenous status and sex.
RESULTS: Life expectancy for Indigenous men increased from 56.6 years in 1999 to 
65.6 years in 2018 (change, 9.0 years; 95% CI, 7.9-10.0 years) and from 64.8 to 
69.7 years for Indigenous women (4.9 years; 95% CI, 3.2-6.7 years); for 
non-Indigenous men, it increased from 77.4 to 81.0 years (3.6 years; 95% CI, 
2.8-4.4 years), and from 84.3 to 85.1 years for non-Indigenous women (0.8 years; 
95% CI, -0.4 to 1.9 years). Increased life expectancy for Indigenous men was 
primarily linked with fewer years of life lost to cancer (23% of overall 
change), unintentional injuries (18%), and cardiovascular disease (17%), and for 
Indigenous women with fewer life years lost to cancer (24%), intentional 
injuries (17%), and kidney disease (14%). During 1999-2018, the difference in 
life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people declined by 26% for 
men (from 20.8 to 15.4 years) and by 21% for women (from 19.5 to 15.4 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy improved markedly during 1999-2018 for Indigenous 
people in the NT, particularly with respect to fewer years of life lost to 
cancer, injuries, and chronic disease. The smaller gains in life expectancy for 
non-Indigenous people were linked with improved survival for those with cancer 
and neurological conditions.

Based on the Global Burden of Disease study 2019, the standardized mortality 
rate and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate of children under 5 years 
old were selected as evaluation indicators to compare and analyze the current 
situation and differences of disease burden of children under 5 years old 
between China and other regions from 1990 to 2019. The change trend and 
difference of disease burden of children under 5 years old in China were 
analyzed by sexes. From 1990 to 2019, the all-cause standardized mortality rate 
of children under 5 years old in China decreased from 1 153.81/100 000 to 
160.39/100 000, and the all-cause standardized DALY rate decreased from 104 
426.40/100 000 to 16 479.01/100 000. In 2019, neonatal preterm birth, congenital 
heart anomalies and lower respiratory infections ranked the top three disease 
burden of children under 5 years old in China. Except that the disease burden of 
neonatal preterm birth was lower than that in North America, they were much 
higher than that in Western Europe and North America in the same period. The 
burden of unintentional injury diseases, including pulmonary aspiration and 
foreign body in airway and drowning, was higher than that in Western Europe and 
North America. The standardized mortality and DALY rate of the top ten diseases 
and injuries in boys and girls under 5 years old in China showed a downward 
trend (P<0.05), and most of them were higher in boys than girls (P<0.05). From 
1990 to 2019, the disease burden of children under 5 years old in China 
decreased significantly. However, compared other regions, it is still necessary 
to strengthen the prevention and control of neonatal premature birth, birth 
defects and unintentional injuries, and take different sex-specific 
interventions to improve the overall health of children.

2019）数据，选取1990—2019年国内外5岁以下儿童标化死亡率与标化伤残调整寿命年（DALYs）率作为评价指标，比较分析中国和国外5岁以下儿童的疾病负担现状及差异，并对中国不同性别5岁以下儿童疾病负担变化趋势及差异进行分析。1990—2019年中国5岁以下儿童全因标化死亡率由1 
153.81/10万降至160.39/10万，全因标化DALYs率由104 426.40/10万降至16 
479.01/10万。2019年新生儿早产、先天性心脏异常、下呼吸道感染位列中国5岁以下儿童疾病负担前3位，除新生儿早产疾病负担低于北美外，均远高于西欧和北美同期水平。肺部吸入物和气道异物、溺水在内的非故意伤害类疾病负担均高于西欧和北美。中国5岁以下男童和女童前10位疾病和伤害的标化死亡率和标化DALYs率均呈逐年下降趋势（P<0.05），其中多数标化率男童高于女童（P<0.05）。1990—2019年中国5岁以下儿童疾病负担大幅度下降，但相较于国外仍要加强新生儿早产、出生缺陷、非故意伤害类疾病的防控，针对性别差异采取不同干预措施，改善儿童整体健康水平。.

With emerging information about the potential for morbidity and reduced life 
expectancy with long-term use of opioids, it is logical to evaluate nonopioid 
analgesic treatments to manage pain states. Combinations of drugs can provide 
additive and/or synergistic effects that can benefit the management of pain 
states. In this regard, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) 
modulate nociceptive signals and have been studied for chronic pain treatment. 
Psilocybin, commonly known as "magic mushrooms", works at the serotonin 
receptor, 5-HT2A. Psilocybin has been found in current studies to help with 
migraines since it has a tryptamine structure and works similarly to triptans. 
Psilocybin also has the potential for use in chronic pain treatment. However, 
the studies that have looked at alternative plant-based medications such as THC, 
CBD, and psilocybin have been small in terms of their sample size and may not 
consider the demographic or genetic differences in the population because of 
their small sample sizes. At present, it is unclear whether the effects reported 
in these studies translate to the general population or even are significant. In 
summary, additional studies are warranted to evaluate chronic pain management

BACKGROUND: The role of smoking in racial disparities in mortality and life 
expectancy in the United States has been examined previously, but up-to-date 
estimates are generally unavailable, even though smoking prevalence has declined 
in recent decades.
OBJECTIVE: We estimate the contribution of smoking-attributable mortality to 
observed differences in mortality and life expectancy for US African-American 
and white adults from 2000-2019.
METHODS: The indirect Preston-Glei-Wilmoth method was used with national vital 
statistics and population data and nationally representative never-smoker lung 
cancer death rates to estimate the smoking-attributable fraction (SAF) of deaths 
in the United States by sex-race group from 2000-2019. Mortality rates without 
smoking-attributable mortality were used to estimate life expectancy at age 50 
(e 50) by group during the period.
RESULTS: African-American men had the highest estimated SAF during the period, 
beginning at 26.4% (95% CI:25.0%-27.8%) in 2000 and ending at 12.1% (95% 
CI:11.4%-12.8%) in 2019. The proportion of the difference in e 50 for white and 
African-American men that was due to smoking decreased from 27.7% to 14.8%. For 
African-American and white women, the estimated differences in e 50 without 
smoking-attributable mortality were similar to observed differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking continues to contribute to racial disparities in mortality 
and life expectancy among men in the United States.
CONTRIBUTION: We present updated estimates of the contribution of smoking to 
mortality differences in the United States using nationally representative data 
sources.

Objectives: Taking the life expectancy (LE) of Non-Hispanic White (NHW) 
Americans as an example to provide potential references for improving LE 
globally. Methods: We collected complete data from the United States (US) CDC, 
Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom (UK), and the OECD 
publications, and described LE changes of NHW Americans by cross-national 
comparison and Arriaga's method. Results: LE of NHW Americans was not as 
optimistic as European countries from 2006 to 2018. The LE annual average growth 
rate was 0.04% for NHW Americans, 0.19% for the UK population, and the median of 
25 countries was 0.24%. Compared with the other age groups, the age group 30-34 
revealed an inferior impact on the LE of NHW people, of which accidents and 
intentional self-harm were likely to be the top two direct causes. Conclusion: 
Finding out the direct causes that affect the LE growth in different age groups 
is conducive to making a targeted intervention or solving the LE growth 
bottleneck.

Powdery mildew of wheat, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a 
devastating disease that seriously reduces yield and quality worldwide. 
Utilization of plant resistance genes is an attractive and effective strategy 
for controlling this disease. Among the reported powdery mildew (Pm) resistance 
genes, Pm2 exhibits a diverse resistance spectrum among its multiple alleles. It 
has been widely used in China for resistance breeding for powdery mildew. To 
mine more Pm2 alleles and clarify their distribution, we screened 33 wheat 
cultivars/breeding lines carrying Pm2 alleles from 641 wheat genotypes using 
diagnostic and Pm2-linked markers. To further investigate the relationships 
within the Pm2 alleles, we compared their resistance spectra, polymorphism of 
marker alleles and gene sequences, and found that they have identical marker 
alleles and gene sequences but diverse resistance spectra. In addition, the 
diagnostic kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) marker, YTU-KASP-Pm2, was 
developed and was shown to detect all the Pm2 alleles in the different genetic 
backgrounds. These findings provide valuable information for the distribution 
and rational use of Pm2 alleles, push forward their marker-assisted breeding 
(MAS), and hence improve the control of wheat powdery mildew.

Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a heterogenous group of disorders due to 
genetically determined deficits of lysosomal enzymes. The specific molecular 
mechanism and disease phenotype depends on the type of storage material. Several 
disorders affect the brain resulting in severe clinical manifestations that 
substantially impact the expectancy and quality of life. Current treatment 
modalities for LSDs include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic 
cell transplantation (HCT) from allogeneic healthy donors, but are available for 
a limited number of disorders and lack efficacy on several clinical 
manifestations. Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (HSC GT) based on 
integrating lentiviral vectors resulted in robust clinical benefit when 
administered to patients affected by Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, for whom it 
is now available as a registered medicinal product. More recently, HSC GT has 
also shown promising results in Hurler syndrome patients. Here, we discuss 
possible novel HSC GT indications that are currently under development. If these 
novel drugs will prove effective, they might represent a new standard of care 
for these disorders, but several challenges will need to be addresses, including 
defining and possibly expanding the patient population for whom HSC GT could be 
efficacious.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
low power micro radiofrequency (RF) therapy (μRFthera®) through urethra in the 
treatment of overactive bladders (OAB) through a prospective, single-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical protocol.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fourteen patients with refractory OAB 
were randomized at 2:1 ratio, treatment to control undergoing same procedures 
except only the micro-RF treatment group at turned "on" setting in energy. 
Bladder diaries recorded during the screening period (3 days before enrollment) 
and during follow-up period on week 1, 3, and 7, respectively. The patients in 
control could choose receiving an energized treatment during extension stage.
RESULTS: The treatment efficacy was 76.1%. There was 49.80% rate improvement 
compared to control (95%CL 32.48%, 67.13%). The crude rate ration (RR) was 2.89, 
95% CI (1.67-5.01) with p < 0.001 in uni-variate analysis, while the RR became 
2.94, 95% CI (1.67-5.16) with p < 0.001 after adjusted potential confounding 
factors in multi-variate analysis. Statistically significant improvements have 
been demonstrated in the frequency of urination, urgency, nocturia, and quality 
of life (QoL) scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Micro RF therapy is safe and effective for the treatment of OAB. 
The main treatment-related complications were catheterization related 
complications.

Sciences, Rensselaer, New York, 12144, United States.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is rare and fatal glioma with limited treatment 
options. Treatments provide minimal improvement in prognosis and only 6.8% of 
GBM patients have a life expectancy greater than five years. Surgical resection 
of this malignant glioma is difficult due to its highly invasive nature and 
follow-up radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide, the currently approved 
standard of care, and will only extend the life of patients by a few months. It 
has been nearly two decades since the approval of temozolomide and there have 
been no clinically relevant major breakthroughs since, painting a dismal picture 
for patients with GBM. Although the future of GBM management seems bleak, there 
are many new treatment options on the horizon that propose methods of delivery 
to circumvent current limitations in the standard of care, i.e., the blood brain 
barrier and treatment resistance mechanisms. The nose is a highly accessible 
non-invasive route of delivery that has been incorporated into many 
investigational studies within the past five years and potentially paves the 
path to a brighter future for the management of GBM. Intranasal administration 
has its limitations however, as drugs can be degraded and/or fail to reach the 
site of action. This has prompted many studies for implementation of 
nanoparticle systems to overcome these limitations and to accurately deliver 
drugs to the site of action. This review highlights the advances in intranasal 
therapy delivery and impact of nanotechnology in the management of GBM and 
discusses potential treatment modalities that show promise for further 
investigation.

Consumers' interest in food with less and/or free from synthetic additives has 
increased considerably in recent years. In this context, researchers and 
industries have concentrated efforts on developing alternatives to these 
compounds. Replacing synthetic additives in meat products is a challenge, given 
their importance for sensory characteristics and food safety. Complementary 
technologies combined with the replacement and/or reduction of synthetic 
additives (hurdle technologies) has been studied focusing on the protection and 
extension of the shelf life of meat products. This review reports alternatives 
for replacing and/or reducing the use of synthetic additives in meat 
derivatives, aiming at the development of more natural and simpler meat 
products, familiar to consumers and considered clean labels.

PURPOSE: An unprecedented surge has been noted in rhino-orbital-Cerebral 
mucormycosis (ROCM) in times of current COVID-19 pandemic. The present 
prospective study aims to evaluate clinico-epidemiological profile, risk 
factors, management, and outcome of the cases of ROCM that presented to our 
tertiary care center during the study period from April to June 2021.
METHODS: All patients were subjected to complete history taking, 
ophthalmological examination, and imaging studies. The patients were staged and 
were treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (AMB) and sino-nasal 
debridement of local necrotic tissue. Transcutaneous retrobulbar AMB (TRAMB), 
orbital decompression, and exenteration were instituted as indicated. All 
patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months before arriving at the final 
outcome. Statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 49 patients presented during the study period, with a mean 
age of 42.2 years. The major risk factors included uncontrolled diabetes 
(89.8%), COVID-19 positivity (51.02%), and concurrent steroid use (38.77%). The 
most common presenting symptom was facial pain/swelling (43.65%), while the most 
common presenting sign was deterioration in vision (75.51%). Intravenous 
liposomal AMB was given to all patients along with sino-nasal debridement 
(85.71%), TRAMB (57.14%), orbital decompression (14.28%), and exenteration 
(12.24%). Overall, mortality at 6 months was 22.45% (11 patients). Age more than 
60 years, intracranial extension, and HbA1c of more than 8.0% were observed to 
be statistically significant indicators of mortality.
CONCLUSION: Early suspicion and timely diagnosis of mucormycosis at 
rhino-orbital stage is warranted in order to salvage life as well as visual 
function. TRAMB may prove as potentially favorable treatment modality in cases 
with limited orbital involvement.

Prior to the nineteenth century, infectious disease was one of the leading 
causes of death. Human life expectancy has roughly doubled over the past century 
as a result of the development of antibiotics and vaccines. However, the 
emergence of antibiotic-resistant superbugs brings new challenges. The side 
effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as causing antimicrobial resistance 
and destroying the normal flora, often limit their applications. Furthermore, 
the development of new antibiotics has lagged far behind the emergence and 
spread of antibiotic resistance. On the other hand, the genome complexity of 
bacteria makes it difficult to create effective vaccines. Therefore, novel 
therapeutic agents in supplement to antibiotics and vaccines are urgently needed 
to improve the treatment of infections. In recent years, monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) have achieved remarkable clinical success in a variety of fields. In the 
treatment of infectious diseases, mAbs can play functions through multiple 
mechanisms, including toxins neutralization, virulence factors inhibition, 
complement-mediated killing activity, and opsonic phagocytosis. Toxins and 
bacterial surface components are good targets to generate antibodies against. 
The U.S. FDA has approved three monoclonal antibody drugs, and there are 
numerous candidates in the preclinical or clinical trial stages. This article 
reviews recent advances in the research and development of anti-bacterial 
monoclonal antibody drugs in order to provide a valuable reference for future 
studies in this area. KEY POINTS: • Novel drugs against antibiotic-resistant 
superbugs are urgently required • Monoclonal antibodies can treat bacterial 
infections through multiple mechanisms • There are many anti-bacterial 
monoclonal antibodies developed in recent years and some candidates have entered 
the preclinical or clinical stages of development.

BACKGROUND: Surgical gastrojejunostomy has traditionally been the palliative 
treatment of choice for patients with advanced malignancies and gastric outlet 
obstruction syndrome. Recently, palliative endoscopic duodenal stenting has 
increased in popularity. We report outcomes after gastrojejunostomy and duodenal 
stenting when used for palliative indications.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing palliative gastrojejunostomy or 
palliative endoscopic duodenal stenting in a Finnish tertiary referral center 
between January 2015 and December 2020 were included. The postoperative outcomes 
of these two palliative interventions were compared. The main outcome measures 
were mortality and morbidity, rate of reoperations, postoperative oral intake 
ability, and length of hospital stay.
RESULTS: A total of 88 patients, 46 (52%) patients underwent palliative 
gastrojejunostomy and 42 (48%) duodenal stenting. All patients had malignant 
disease, most typically hepatopancreatic cancer. Nineteen (44%) patients in 
duodenal stenting group and 4 (8.7%) patients in gastrojejunostomy group 
required subsequent interventions due to persisting or progressing symptoms 
(p < 0.001). Median delay until first oral intake was 2 days (1-24) after 
gastrojejunostomy and 0 days (0-3) after stenting (p < 0.001). Postoperative 
morbidity was 30% after gastrojejunostomy and 45% after stenting (p < 0.001). 
Median length of hospital stay was 7 days (1-27) after surgery and 5 days (0-20) 
after endoscopy (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing endoscopic duodenal stenting are more able to 
initiate rapid oral intake and have shorter hospital stay. On the other hand, 
there are significantly more reoperations in stenting group. If the patient's 
life expectancy is short, we recommend stenting, but for patients whose life 
expectancy is longer, gastrojejunostomy could be a better procedure, for the 
reasons mentioned above.

This study aimed to compare shoulder tendinopathy treatment with therapeutic 
ultrasound combined with LED photobiomodulation therapy using LED-infrared 
(850 nm) or LED-red (640 nm). The study assessed 75 patients, aged 45 to 
70 years, distributed into five experimental groups (15 patients each): 
therapeutic ultrasound (US), infrared light irradiation (IR), visible red light 
irradiation (VR), infrared light and ultrasound combined (IR-US), and red light 
in conjunction with ultrasound (VR-US). The ultrasound parameters are 1 MHz, 
0.5 W/cm2 (SATA), and 100 Hz repetition rate, applied for 4 min each session. 
LED irradiation protocols were as follows: 3 points, 7.5 J per point, IR-LED 750 
mW, 10 s, VR-LED 250 mW, 30 s. LED irradiation is followed by ultrasound in the 
combined therapies. The efficiency of the five therapies was evaluated assessing 
12 parameters: quality of life (Health Assessment Questionnaire, HAQ), pain 
intensity (Visual Analog Scale, VAS), articular amplitude of shoulder movement 
(flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial rotation, lateral rotation), 
muscle strength (abduction, lateral rotation), and electromyography (lateral 
rotation, abduction). Treatments comprised 12 sessions for 4 weeks. Intra-group 
analysis showed that the five therapies significantly improved the recovery of 
all parameters after treatment. Regarding the comparison of irradiated therapies 
and ultrasound, statistical analysis showed that IR-US was a better treatment 
than US for all 12 parameters. IR treatment exceeded US on 9 items, whereas that 
VR and VR-US therapies exceeded US in 7 and 10 parameters, respectively 
(p < 0.05). Because of that, IR-US shows to be the best treatment for rotator 
cuff tendinopathy. In conclusion, improvements in quality of life, pain 
intensity relief, shoulder amplitude motion, and muscle strength force obtained 
with ultrasound therapy are enhanced by adding infrared LED irradiation to 
ultrasound for patients suffering from rotator cuff tendinopathy. This study was 
registered with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC) under 
Universal Trial Number (UTN) U1111-1219-3594 (2018/22/08).
