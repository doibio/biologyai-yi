medicine, pathology and surgery: Liverpool Heart & Chest Hospital, Merseyside, 
and Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 50-75 years, at high risk of lung cancer, in the 
primary care trusts adjacent to the centres.
INTERVENTIONS: A thoracic LDCT scan. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans as 
per protocol. Referral to multidisciplinary team clinics was determined by 
nodule size criteria.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Population-based recruitment based on risk 
stratification; management of the trial through web-based database; optimal 
characteristics of CT scan readers (radiologists vs. radiographers); 
characterisation of CT-detected nodules utilising volumetric analysis; 
prevalence of lung cancer at baseline; sociodemographic factors affecting 
participation; psychosocial measures (cancer distress, anxiety, depression, 
decision satisfaction); and cost-effectiveness modelling.
RESULTS: A total of 247,354 individuals were approached to take part in the 
trial; 30.7% responded positively to the screening invitation. Recruitment of 
participants resulted in 2028 in the CT arm and 2027 in the control arm. A total 
of 1994 participants underwent CT scanning: 42 participants (2.1%) were 
diagnosed with lung cancer; 36 out of 42 (85.7%) of the screen-detected cancers 
were identified as stage 1 or 2, and 35 (83.3%) underwent surgical resection as 
their primary treatment. Lung cancer was more common in the lowest socioeconomic 
group. Short-term adverse psychosocial consequences were observed in 
participants who were randomised to the intervention arm and in those who had a 
major lung abnormality detected, but these differences were modest and 
temporary. Rollout of screening as a service or design of a full trial would 
need to address issues of outreach. The health-economic analysis suggests that 
the intervention could be cost-effective but this needs to be confirmed using 
data on actual lung cancer mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) pilot was successfully 
undertaken with 4055 randomised individuals. The data from the UKLS provide 
evidence that adds to existing data to suggest that lung cancer screening in the 
UK could potentially be implemented in the 60-75 years age group, selected via 
the Liverpool Lung Project risk model version 2 and using CT volumetry-based 
management protocols.
FUTURE WORK: The UKLS data will be pooled with the NELSON (Nederlands Leuvens 
Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek: Dutch-Belgian Randomised Lung Cancer Screening 
Trial) and other European Union trials in 2017 which will provide European 
mortality and cost-effectiveness data. For now, there is a clear need for 
mortality results from other trials and further research to identify optimal 
methods of implementation and delivery. Strategies for increasing uptake and 
providing support for underserved groups will be key to implementation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Progesterone is essential to maintain a healthy 
pregnancy. Guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 
and a Cochrane review called for a definitive trial to test whether or not 
progesterone therapy in the first trimester could reduce the risk of miscarriage 
in women with a history of unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM). The PROMISE 
trial was conducted to answer this question. A concurrent cost-effectiveness 
analysis was conducted.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
international multicentre study, with economic evaluation, conducted in hospital 
settings across the UK (36 sites) and in the Netherlands (nine sites).
PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Women with unexplained RM (three or more 
first-trimester losses), aged between 18 and 39 years at randomisation, 
conceiving naturally and giving informed consent, received either micronised 
progesterone (Utrogestan(®), Besins Healthcare) at a dose of 400 mg (two vaginal 
capsules of 200 mg) or placebo vaginal capsules twice daily, administered 
vaginally from soon after a positive urinary pregnancy test (and no later than 6 
weeks of gestation) until 12 completed weeks of gestation (or earlier if the 
pregnancy ended before 12 weeks).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Live birth beyond 24 completed weeks of gestation 
(primary outcome), clinical pregnancy at 6-8 weeks, ongoing pregnancy at 12 
weeks, miscarriage, gestation at delivery, neonatal survival at 28 days of life, 
congenital abnormalities and resource use.
METHODS: Participants were randomised after confirmation of pregnancy. 
Randomisation was performed online via a secure internet facility. Data were 
collected on four occasions of outcome assessment after randomisation, up to 28 
days after birth.
RESULTS: A total of 1568 participants were screened for eligibility. Of the 836 
women randomised between 2010 and 2013, 404 received progesterone and 432 
received placebo. The baseline data (age, body mass index, maternal ethnicity, 
smoking status and parity) of the participants were comparable in the two arms 
of the trial. The follow-up rate to primary outcome was 826 out of 836 (98.8%). 
The live birth rate in the progesterone group was 65.8% (262/398) and in the 
placebo group it was 63.3% (271/428), giving a relative risk of 1.04 (95% 
confidence interval 0.94 to 1.15; p = 0.45). There was no evidence of a 
significant difference between the groups for any of the secondary outcomes. 
Economic analysis suggested a favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
for decision-making but wide confidence intervals indicated a high level of 
uncertainty in the health benefits. Additional sensitivity analysis suggested 
the probability that progesterone would fall within the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence's threshold of £20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year as between 0.7145 and 0.7341.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that first-trimester progesterone therapy 
improves outcomes in women with a history of unexplained RM.
LIMITATIONS: This study did not explore the effect of treatment with other 
progesterone preparations or treatment during the luteal phase of the menstrual 
cycle.
FUTURE WORK: Future research could explore the efficacy of progesterone 
supplementation administered during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in 
women attempting natural conception despite a history of RM.

metabolites of vacuum-packed fillets of farmed and wild sea bass (Dicentrarchus

BACKGROUND: Fish shelf-life extension is a topic of great interest. In this 
study the behaviour of salted and unsalted farmed and wild European sea bass 
(Dicentrarchus labrax) fillets during storage was analysed through the evolution 
of their volatile metabolites. Farmed and wild sea bass fillets were 
brine-salted for 15 or 75 min, or dry-salted, vacuum-packed and stored at 4 °C 
for up to 1 month, and their headspaces were studied by Solid Phase Micro 
extraction-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS).
RESULTS: At the same storage time, unsalted wild fillets contained, in general, 
a higher number and abundance of volatile compounds coming from microbiological 
or endogenous enzymatic activity than unsalted farmed ones. The more intense the 
salting, the lower the number and abundance of microbiological spoilage 
metabolites, especially in wild samples. The appearance of oxidation metabolites 
only in dry-salted wild samples evidences that this kind of salting provokes a 
certain oxidation in these samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The better performance of farmed than wild fillets suggests that 
salted farmed fillets, vacuum-packed and stored under refrigeration conditions, 
could be a successful alternative to diversify the presence of sea bass in the 
market. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential for gait speed to inform decisions 
regarding optimal systolic blood pressure targets in older adults.
DESIGN: Forecasting study from 2014 to 2023 using the Cardiovascular Disease 
Policy Model, a Markov model.
SETTING: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
PARTICIPANTS: U.S. adults aged 60-94 stratified into fast walking, slow walking, 
and poor functioning (noncompleters) based on measured gait speed.
MEASUREMENTS: Lowering SBP to a target of 140 or 150 mmHg was modeled in persons 
with (secondary prevention) and without (primary prevention) a history of 
coronary heart disease or stroke. Based on clinical trials and observational 
studies, it was projected that slow-walking and poor-functioning participants 
would have greater noncardiovascular mortality. Myocardial infarctions (MIs), 
strokes, deaths, cost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were measured.
RESULTS: Regardless of gait speed, it was projected that secondary prevention to 
a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mmHg would prevent more events and save 
more money than secondary prevention to 150 mmHg. Similarly, primary prevention 
to 140 mmHg in fast-walking adults was projected to prevent events and save 
money. In slow-walking adults, primary prevention to 150 mmHg was projected to 
prevent MIs and strokes and save DALYs but was cost saving only in men; 
intensification to 140 mmHg is of uncertain benefit in slow-walking individuals. 
Primary prevention in poor-functioning adults to a target of 140 or 150 mmHg SBP 
is projected to decrease DALYs.
CONCLUSION: The most cost-effective SBP target varies according to history of 
cardiovascular disease and gait speed in persons aged 60-94. These projections 
highlight the need for better estimates of the benefits and harms of 
antihypertensive medications in a diverse group of older adults, because the net 
benefit is sensitive to the characteristics of the population treated.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the appropriateness of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) in 
women and elderly adults, looking for patterns of undertreatment or unnecessary 
treatment.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Primary care practices of an academic healthcare system.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (aged 28-93) with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) seen 
between March 2013 and February 2014 (N = 1,585).
MEASUREMENTS: Treatment recommendations were made using an AF decision support 
tool (AFDST) based on projections of quality-adjusted life expectancy calculated 
using a decision analytical model that integrates individual-specific risk 
factors for stroke and hemorrhage.
RESULTS: Treatment was discordant from AFDST-recommended treatment in 45% 
(326/725) of women and 39% (338/860) of men (P = .02). Although current 
treatment was discordant from recommended in 35% (89/258) of participants aged 
85 and older and in 43% (575/1,328) of those younger than 85 (P = .01), many 
undertreated elderly adults were receiving aspirin as the sole antithrombotic 
agent.
CONCLUSION: Physicians should understand that female sex is a significant risk 
factor for AF-related stroke and incorporate this into decision-making about 
thromboprophylaxis. Treating older adults with aspirin instead of OAT exposes 
them to significant risk of bleeding with little to no reduction in AF-related 
stroke risk.

INTRODUCTION: Immune dysfunction, promoted by pro-inflammatory cytokines, plays 
a pivotal role in neurodegeneration associated with Huntington's disease.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the emerging immunoregulatory and 
antiinflammatory properties of Sertoli cells in Huntington's disease.
METHODS: The experimental R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease was treated 
by a single intraperitoneal injection of microencapsulated prepubertal porcine 
Sertoli cells and lifespan, motor performance and striatal inflammatory pattern 
have been evaluated.
RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrated that a single intraperitoneal 
injection of microencapsulated prepubertal porcine Sertoli cells uniquely 
improved performances and extended the life expectancy of R6/2 Huntington's 
disease mice, by immune dysfunction modulation in brain.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the immunomodulatory and trophic role of 
Sertoli cells that could be of help in the treatment of neurodegenerative 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: The PAST-BP trial found that using a lower systolic blood pressure 
target (<130 mmHg or lower versus <140 mmHg) in a primary care population with 
prevalent cerebrovascular disease was associated with a small additional 
reduction in blood pressure (2.9 mmHg).
OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost effectiveness of an intensive systolic blood 
pressure target (<130 mmHg or lower) compared with a standard target (<140 mmHg) 
in people with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack on general 
practice stroke/transient ischaemic attack registers in England.
METHODS: A Markov model with a one-year time cycle and a 30-year time horizon 
was used to estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life year of an intensive 
target versus a standard target. Individual patient level data were used from 
the PAST-BP trial with regard to change in blood pressure and numbers of primary 
care consultations over a 12-month period. Published sources were used to 
estimate life expectancy and risks of cardiovascular events and their associated 
costs and utilities.
RESULTS: In the base-case results, aiming for an intensive blood pressure target 
was dominant, with the incremental lifetime costs being £169 lower per patient 
than for the standard blood pressure target with a 0.08 quality-adjusted life 
year gain. This was robust to sensitivity analyses, unless intensive blood 
pressure lowering reduced quality of life by 2% or more.
CONCLUSION: Aiming for a systolic blood pressure target of <130 mmHg or lower is 
cost effective in people who have had a stroke/transient ischaemic attack in the 
community, but it is difficult to separate out the impact of the lower target 
from the impact of more active management of blood pressure.

Strategies for the Management of Early-Stage Breast Cancer in Older Women.

Older patients with breast cancer (aged ≥65 years) are often undertreated with 
both locoregional and systemic therapies and have been shown to have higher 
breast cancer-specific mortality. These patients are also excluded from most 
clinical trials; therefore, treatment recommendations are extrapolated from 
younger populations. The data that do exist, however, show that older patients 
usually tolerate and respond well to conventional treatments. When selecting 
treatments for breast cancer, age should not be the chief consideration; 
comorbidities and functional status are also important, as is life expectancy. 
For patients with an estimated survival of less than 5 years, aggressive 
treatment may be discouraged; however, if the estimated survival is 5 years or 
more, treatment according to recurrence risk is recommended. In the curative 
setting, undertreatment should be avoided.

Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) plays a critical role in the 
destruction of terminally misfolded proteins at the secretory pathway. The 
system also regulates expression levels of several proteins such as Pca1p, a 
cadmium exporter in yeast. To gain better insight into the mechanisms underlying 
ERAD of Pca1p and other polytopic proteins by the proteasome in the cytosol, our 
study determined the roles for the molecular factors of ERAD in dislodging Pca1p 
from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Inactivation of the 20S proteasome leads to 
accumulation of ubiquitinated Pca1p in the ER membrane, suggesting a role for 
the proteasome in extraction of Pca1p from the ER. Pca1p formed a complex with 
the proteasome at the membrane in a Doa10p E3 ligase-dependent manner. Cdc48p is 
required for recruiting the proteasome to Pca1p. Although the Ufd2p E4 ubiquitin 
chain extension enzyme is involved in efficient degradation of Pca1p, 
Ufd2p-deficient cells did not affect the formation of a complex between Pca1p 
and the proteasome. Two other polytopic membrane proteins undergoing ERAD, 
Ste6*p and Hmg2p, also displayed the same outcomes observed for Pca1p. However, 
poly-ubiquitinated Cpy1*p, a luminal ERAD substrate, was detected in the cytosol 
independent of proteolytic activities of the proteasome. These results indicate 
that extraction and degradation of polytopic membrane proteins at the ER is a 
coupled event. This mechanism would relieve the cost of exposed hydrophobic 
domains in the cytosol during ERAD.

397. The Benefits of a Universal Home-Based Neonatal Care Package in Rural India:
An  Extended Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.

Each year, 27 percent of the world’s newborn deaths— about 748,000—occur in 
India according to 2013 estimates (UN IGME 2014). India’s newborn mortality rate 
(NMR) has declined by nearly 43 percent since 1990. However, this decline has 
been much slower than the decline in the mortality rate for children under age 
five years, which has dropped by 58 percent during the same period. 
Consequently, the share of newborn deaths among all under-five deaths in India 
has risen from 41 percent in 1990 to 56 percent in 2013, highlighting the 
relative lack of progress made in newborn survival. Conditions associated with 
neonates—such as preterm birth complications and sepsis—rank among the top 10 
causes of all premature mortality in India (CDC 2015). A study in 2005 found 
that prematurity and low birth weight, infections, birth asphyxia, and birth 
trauma caused nearly 80 percent of newborn deaths (Bassani and others 2010). 
India’s NMR of 29 per 1,000 live births continues to be among the highest in the 
world, underscoring the need for a policy response (UN IGME 2014) (figure 18.1). 
Although antenatal care and other preventive interventions such as encouraging 
institutional delivery and improving maternal health care access have been 
implemented, their impact on newborn survival has been minimal (Hollowell and 
others 2009; Lim and others 2010; Singh and others 2013). Good quality postnatal 
care may prevent about 67 percent of all newborn deaths (WHO 2012) in India. 
However, availability of and access to postnatal care remain low. Data from the 
District Level Household Survey conducted between 2007 and suggest that only 45 
percent of newborns in India underwent a health examination within the first 24 
hours (IIPS 2010). In addition to low levels of access to newborn care in 
general, large regional and socioeconomic differences in access lead to 
significant variations in outcomes. The mortality among newborns in India’s 
rural areas is twice that in urban areas—34 and 17 per 1,000 live births, 
respectively— with mortality rates substantially exceeding the national average 
in the poorer and larger states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, 
Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, and Chhattisgarh (Chand and others 2013). In this 
chapter, we examine the health and economic benefits and the cost to the 
government associated with scaling up a publicly financed home-based neonatal 
care (HBNC) package in rural India. We consider two intervention scenarios 
against a baseline of no HBNC: In the first scenario, we examine the scaling up 
of access to HBNC through the current network of accredited social health 
activists (ASHA)—a group of community health workers (CHWs) that covers 60.1 
percent of India’s villages (or roughly 54 percent of the rural population)—to 
those not presently receiving care. Of rural newborns, 39.8 percent receive some 
form of home- or facility-based newborn care during the first 10 days of life 
(IIPS 2010). By extending HBNC within the current network of ASHA workers, 72 
percent of the rural newborn population would have access to care either through 
the HBNC package or their existing home-or facility-based care. In the second 
scenario, we analyze a near-universal setting in which access to HBNC—through 
expansion of the network of CHWs—is extended to 83.4 percent of those not 
presently receiving care. With this extension, 90 percent of the rural neonate 
population would have access to the HBNC package or their existing home- or 
facility-based care. Box 18.1 provides information on the types of CHWs and the 
primary health systems in which they operate.

398. Excess Mortality from Mental, Neurological, and Substance Use Disorders in
the  Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.

In: Patel V, Chisholm D, Dua T, Laxminarayan R, Medina-Mora ME, editors. Mental, 
Neurological, and Substance Use Disorders: Disease Control Priorities, Third 
Edition (Volume 4). Washington (DC): The International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development / The World Bank; 2016 Mar 14. Chapter 3.

Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) have reinforced 
the understanding of the significant impact that mental, neurological, and 
substance use disorders have on population health (Murray and others 2012; 
Whiteford and others 2013). One key finding was the health transition from 
communicable to noncommunicable diseases across all regions. This transition was 
particularly evident in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Murray and 
others 2012), where the proportion of burden attributable to noncommunicable 
disease increased from 36 percent in 1990 to 49 percent in 2010, compared with 
an increase from 80 percent to 83 percent in high-income countries (HICs) (IHME 
2013). GBD 2010 estimates that the majority of disease burden caused by mental, 
neurological, and substance use disorders is from nonfatal health loss; only 15 
percent of the total burden is from mortality in years of life lost (YLLs) (IHME 
2013). This finding may erroneously lead to the interpretation that premature 
death in people with mental, neurological, and substance use disorders is 
inconsequential. A recent review has shown higher mortality risks than the 
general population for a range of mental disorders, with a standardized 
mortality ratio (SMR) as high as 14.7 for opioid use disorders (Chesney, 
Goodwin, and Fazel 2014). Excess mortality in people with epilepsy is reported 
to be two-to three-fold higher than that of the general population, with an 
increased risk up to six-fold higher in LMICs (Diop and others 2005). A 
significant proportion of these deaths is preventable (Diop and others 2005; 
Jette and Trevathan 2014). There are multiple causes for lower life expectancy 
in people with mental disorders (Chang and others 2011; Crump and others 2013; 
Lawrence, Hancock, and Kisely 2013). Self-harm is an important cause of death, 
but the majority of premature deaths are caused by chronic physical disease, 
particularly ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, type II diabetes, respiratory 
diseases, and cancer (Crump and others 2013; Lawrence, Hancock, and Kisely 
2013). Dementia is an independent risk factor for premature death; and patients 
with physical impairment, inactivity, and medical comorbidities are at increased 
risk (Park and others 2014). In many HICs, the life expectancy gap between those 
with mental disorders and the general population is widening. The general 
population enjoys a longer life, while the lifespan for those with mental, 
neurological, and substance use disorders remains significantly lower and 
unchanged (Lawrence, Hancock, and Kisely 2013). Information on the extent and 
causes of premature mortality in people with mental, neurological, and substance 
use disorders in LMICs is sparse, but these groups are understood to experience 
reduced life expectancy, although causes of death may vary across regions. This 
chapter explores the cause-specific and excess mortality of individual mental, 
neurological, and substance use disorders estimated by GBD 2010 and discusses 
the results. We present the additional burden that can be attributed to these 
disorders, using GBD results for comparative risk assessments (CRAs) assessing 
mental, neurological, and substance use disorders as risk factors for other 
health outcomes. We focus on the following mental, neurological, and substance 
use disorders: Mental disorders, including schizophrenia, major depressive 
disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, autistic disorder, and disruptive 
behavioral disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and 
conduct disorder [CD]). Substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorders 
(alcohol dependence and fetal alcohol syndrome) and opioid, cocaine, cannabis, 
and amphetamine dependence. Neurological disorders, including dementia, 
epilepsy, and migraine. For the purposes of GBD 2010, countries were grouped 
into 21 regions and 7 super-regions based on geographic proximity and levels of 
child and adult mortality (IHME 2014; Murray and others 2012). Regions were 
further grouped into developed and developing categories using the GBD 2010 
method. Details of countries in each region and super-region can be found on the 
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) website (IHME 2014). The 
mortality associated with a disease can be quantified using two different, yet 
complementary, methods employed as part of the GBD analyses. First, 
cause-specific mortality draws on vital registration systems and verbal autopsy 
studies that identify deaths attributed to a single underlying cause using the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) death coding system. Second, GBD 
creates natural history models of disease, drawing on a range of epidemiological 
inputs, which ultimately provide epidemiological estimates for parameters 
including excess mortality—that is, the all-cause mortality rate in a population 
with the disorder above the all-cause mortality rate observed in a population 
without the disorder. By definition, the estimates of excess deaths include 
cause-specific deaths. Although arbitrary, the ICD conventions are a necessary 
attempt to deal with the multi-causal nature of mortality and avoid the 
double-counting of deaths. Despite the system’s clear strengths, cause-specific 
mortality estimated via the ICD obscures the contribution of other underlying 
causes of death—for example, suicide as a direct result of major depressive 
disorder—and likely underestimates the true number of deaths attributable to a 
particular disorder. However, the estimation of excess mortality using natural 
history models often includes deaths from causal and noncausal origins and 
likely overestimates the true number of deaths attributable to a particular 
disorder. The challenge is to parse out causal contributions to mortality, 
beyond those already identified as cause-specific, from the effects of 
confounders. The quantification of the burden attributable to risk factors 
requires approaches such as CRA, which is now an integral part of the GBD 
studies. The fundamental approach is to calculate the proportion of deaths or 
disease burden caused by specific risk factors—for example, lung cancer caused 
by tobacco smoking—while holding all other independent factors constant. A 
counterfactual approach is used to compare the burden associated to an outcome 
with the amount expected in a hypothetical situation of ideal risk factor 
exposure, for example, zero prevalence. This provides a consistent method for 
estimating the changes in population health when decreasing or increasing the 
level of exposure to risk factors (Lim and others 2012).

Myopia is rapidly increasing in young populations and patients with glaucoma 
associated with myopia are reported to be young aged in East Asia. These young 
patients have a longer life expectancy, which increases their risk of 
end-of-life visual disabilities. There is a need to understand the clinical 
course of myopic glaucoma patients, which may be important for the care of these 
myopic populations. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the age 
at presentation and the rate of glaucoma progression in the visual field (VF) 
according to the presence of myopia. The study was conducted as a prospective 
observational study including 179 patients with open-angle glaucoma who had 
undergone at least 5 VF examinations with a follow-up of at least 5 years. The 
progression rate of the mean deviation (MD) and the pattern standard deviation 
(PSD) are expressed as change in decibels (dB) per year. The slopes of the MD 
and PSD were calculated by linear regression analyses. Factors related to the 
slope of VF MD changes were analyzed with correlation and regression analyses. 
The slope of the linear fit line plotted against age at presentation and the 
rate of change in the VF MD was -0.026 (P < 0.001) in the myopic group and 
-0.008 (P = 0.167) in the nonmyopic group; the relationship was more prominent 
in the myopic group than the nonmyopic group. In the myopic group, age 
(β = -0.417; 95% confidence intervals (CI), -0.651 to -0.200; P = 0.050) and 
baseline untreated intraocular pressure (β = -0.179; 95% CI, -0.331 to -0.028; 
P = 0.022) were significantly related to the rate of change in the MD, which was 
only the presence of disc hemorrhage (β = -0.335; 95% CI, -0.568 to -0.018; 
P = 0.022) in the nonmyopic group. Age at presentation was significantly related 
to the rate of change in the VF in glaucomatous eyes with myopia compared to 
eyes without myopia. Older age was significantly related to the rate of change 
in the VF only in myopic glaucomatous eyes.

The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of a holistic, 
comprehensive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment Program in 
Malawi.Comprehensive cost data for the year 2010 have been collected at 30 
facilities from the public network of health centers providing antiretroviral 
treatment (ART) throughout the country; two of these facilities were operated by 
the Disease Relief through Excellent and Advanced Means (DREAM) program.The 
outcomes analysis was carried out over five years comparing two cohorts of 
patients on treatment: 1) 2387 patients who started ART in the two DREAM centers 
during 2008, 2) patients who started ART in Malawi in the same year under the 
Ministry of Health program.Assuming the 2010 cost as constant over the five 
years the cost-effective analysis was undertaken from a health sector and 
national perspective; a sensitivity analysis included two hypothesis of ART 
impact on patients' income.The total cost per patient per year (PPPY) was $314.5 
for the DREAM protocol and $188.8 for the other Malawi ART sites, with 737 
disability adjusted life years (DALY) saved among the DREAM program patients 
compared with the others. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio was $1640 per 
DALY saved; it ranged between $896-1268 for national and health sector 
perspective respectively. The cost per DALY saved remained under $2154 that is 
the AFR-E-WHO regional gross domestic product per capita threshold for a program 
to be considered very cost-effective.HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
comprehensive treatment program that joins ART with laboratory monitoring, 
treatment adherence reinforcing and Malnutrition control can be very 
cost-effective in the sub-Saharan African setting.

BACKGROUND: Decision-making about advanced cancer treatment is complex and may 
be influenced by patients' family context, including the presence of children. 
We explored how parental values and concerns motivate patients' preferences 
about aggressiveness of advanced cancer treatment as well as preferences for 
palliative care and hospice services.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 42 patients with advanced 
cancer who had at least one child under 18 years. We created and applied 
thematic codes. Descriptive analyses were used to report the number of 
participants who mentioned each code.
RESULTS: The majority of participants (29/42) reported that having children 
influenced their preferences for advanced cancer care. For most parents, 
extending life to maximize the time they had left to parent their children was 
important in guiding treatment preferences. Others prioritized preserving their 
physical condition and parental functioning and remaining physically close to 
their children. Many parents discussed life extension and parental functioning 
preservation as competing priorities. Most of the sample expressed interest in 
palliative care services and hospice, but responses by several participants 
reflected concerns about dying at home and lack of clarity about the role of 
early palliative care.
CONCLUSIONS: Parents in our sample expressed that maximizing time with their 
children and preserving parental functioning were important concerns underlying 
their preferences for advanced cancer care. Future research should assess the 
palliative and end-of-life care needs and preferences of parents with advanced 
cancer, which may differ from those of non-parents. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley

Mood disorders have a high incidence of coexisting psychiatric, substance use, 
and physical disorders. When these disorders are unrecognized and left 
untreated, patients are likely to have a reduced life expectancy and experience 
impaired functional and psychosocial deficits and poor quality of life. 
Psychiatric nurses are poised to address the needs of these patients through 
various approaches. Although the ideal approach for mood disorders continues to 
be researched, there is a compilation of data showing that integrated models of 
treatment that reflect person-centered, strength, and recovery-based principles 
produce positive clinical outcomes.

Few socioeconomic studies have so far reported on revascularization for stable 
ischemic heart disease in Japan. This study aimed to validate the sensitivity of 
the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scale for determining the pathology 
and medical technology to be used and to validate the application of a 
cost-utility analysis model. We studied 32 patients who had undergone 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (mean age 67.9 ± 7.3 years). For HRQOL, 
utility and quality of life (QOL) were examined using the EuroQol 5 Dimension 
(EQ-5D) and EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), respectively. The changes in 
the utility index before and after PCI were compared between the PCI and 
coronary angiography (CAG) groups to determine the sensitivity of the EQ-5D that 
was used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Additionally, to 
estimate the cost-utility of PCI 120 months after the procedure, we analyzed our 
study results and the results of previous reports using the Markov chain model. 
The utility index was found to improve in the PCI group (0.08 ± 0.15), whereas 
it decreased in the CAG group (-0.02 ± 0.11) (p = 0.049). The estimated result 
of the cost-utility analysis as the increase in utility above baseline level was 
the expected value, that is, 70,000 US$/QALY. Our findings suggest that QALY may 
be valid as a utility index in the clinical and economic evaluation of PCI in 
Japan.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the views and experiences of mental health 
consumers regarding the availability and quality of care and treatment received 
for their physical health needs.
BACKGROUND: People diagnosed with mental illness have higher occurrence of 
physical health problems. Responsive health care services are crucial for 
prevention and management of physical health problems, and for reducing 
disparities in health between people diagnosed with mental illness and those who 
are not. There is limited research giving voice to consumer perspectives on 
their experiences with health care providers.
DESIGN: Exploratory qualitative.
METHODS: Focus group interviews with mental health consumers accessed via a 
consumer network group in a region of Australia (n = 31). All interview audio 
recordings were transcribed professionally. Interviews were thematically 
analysed.
RESULTS: The main themes were: symptomising; failure to act and alertness to 
prejudice. The first two themes were consumer perceptions of the actions and 
behaviours of health professionals, and the third describes consumer responses 
to these behaviours and actions. Consumers described increased risks of illness 
and death because of undiagnosed physical illness despite their physical health 
advice-seeking as the reason for the health consultation.
CONCLUSION: Health care providers' non-recognition of physical health problems 
presents a clear example of a significant and potentially life threatening 
health inequity. The service provider responses described by participants 
suggest that mental health consumers' physical health needs may not be taken 
seriously.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Clinicians need to take seriously the physical 
health needs and concerns of people with mental illness. Nurses can play a 
crucial role in the prevention of diagnostic overshadowing as part of a broader 
direction of balancing biomedical perspectives with other approaches to health 
care.

BACKGROUND: Upper limb orthoses are frequently prescribed for children with 
cerebral palsy (CP) who have muscle overactivity predominantly due to 
spasticity, with little evidence of long-term effectiveness. Clinical consensus 
is that orthoses help to preserve range of movement: nevertheless, they can be 
complex to construct, expensive, uncomfortable and require commitment from 
parents and children to wear. This protocol paper describes a randomised 
controlled trial to evaluate whether long-term use of rigid wrist/hand orthoses 
(WHO) in children with CP, combined with usual multidisciplinary care, can 
prevent or reduce musculoskeletal impairments, including muscle stiffness/tone 
and loss of movement range, compared to usual multidisciplinary care alone.
METHODS/DESIGN: This pragmatic, multicentre, assessor-blinded randomised 
controlled trial with economic analysis will recruit 194 children with CP, aged 
5-15 years, who present with flexor muscle stiffness of the wrist and/or 
fingers/thumb (Modified Ashworth Scale score ≥1). Children, recruited from 
treatment centres in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia, will be 
randomised to groups (1:1 allocation) using concealed procedures. All children 
will receive care typically provided by their treating organisation. The 
treatment group will receive a custom-made serially adjustable rigid WHO, 
prescribed for 6 h nightly (or daily) to wear for 3 years. An application 
developed for mobile devices will monitor WHO wearing time and adverse events. 
The control group will not receive a WHO, and will cease wearing one if 
previously prescribed. Outcomes will be measured 6 monthly over a period of 
3 years. The primary outcome is passive range of wrist extension, measured with 
fingers extended using a goniometer at 3 years. Secondary outcomes include 
muscle stiffness, spasticity, pain, grip strength and hand deformity. Activity, 
participation, quality of life, cost and cost-effectiveness will also be 
assessed.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence to inform clinicians, services, 
funding agencies and parents/carers of children with CP whether the provision of
