The oxidative status is associated with animal lifespan, metabolism, activity 
and circadian rhythms. The objective of this work is to study the time course of 
the oxidative status over a daily cycle in the plasma, liver and brain, and the 
changes in the plasma cortisol levels of sturgeon and trout. The knowledge of 
daily oxidative status will provide a better understanding of the trout and 
sturgeon physiology and adequate maintenance and food supply of farmed fish in 
relation to photoperiod. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, 
glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, DT-diaphorase activities, lipid 
peroxidation and cortisol were measured. Our results showed that the 
antioxidative enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation in the liver of trout and 
sturgeon changed through the day, with increased levels in lipid peroxidation of 
liver in the dark period for sturgeon. This could be related to the different 
activity time in both species, an issue to be taken into account when designing 
the guidelines of the maintenance of these species in fish farms. On the 
contrary, there was not clear influence of the daily rhythms on brain oxidative 
status. The higher efficiency of the antioxidant defences in the brain of 
sturgeon, which displays less lipid peroxidation and higher antioxidative 
activity, could be related to its longer life expectancy. The absence of any 
apparent daily rhythm in the plasma cortisol levels in sturgeon could indicate a 
lower susceptibility to stress, and that mechanisms involved in cortisol 
secretion in chondrosteans could be different from that described for 
teleosteans.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: IDegLira, a fixed ratio combination of insulin degludec and 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide, utilizes the complementary 
mechanisms of action of these two agents to improve glycemic control with low 
risk of hypoglycemia and avoidance of weight gain. The aim of the present 
analysis was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira vs 
liraglutide added to basal insulin, for patients with type 2 diabetes not 
achieving glycemic control on basal insulin in the US setting.
METHODS: Projections of lifetime costs and clinical outcomes were made using the 
IMS CORE Diabetes Model. Treatment effect data for patients receiving IDegLira 
and liraglutide added to basal insulin were modeled based on the outcomes of a 
published indirect comparison, as no head-to-head clinical trial data is 
currently available. Costs were accounted in 2015 US dollars ($) from a 
healthcare payer perspective.
RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with small improvements in quality-adjusted 
life expectancy compared with liraglutide added to basal insulin (8.94 vs 8.91 
discounted quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). The key driver of improved 
clinical outcomes was the greater reduction in glycated hemoglobin associated 
with IDegLira. IDegLira was associated with mean costs savings of $17,687 over 
patient lifetimes vs liraglutide added to basal insulin, resulting from lower 
treatment costs and cost savings as a result of complications avoided.
CONCLUSIONS: The present long-term modeling analysis found that IDegLira was 
dominant vs liraglutide added to basal insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes 
failing to achieve glycemic control on basal insulin in the US, improving 
clinical outcomes and reducing direct costs.

AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences of biologic 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or Janus kinase/STAT pathway inhibitors 
(collectively referred to as bDMARDs) vs conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs) from the 
US societal perspective for treatment of patients with moderately to severely 
active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with inadequate responses to cDMARDs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An individual patient simulation model was developed that 
assesses the impact of treatments on disease based on clinical trial data and 
real-world evidence. Treatment strategies included sequences starting with 
etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, or abatacept. Each of these treatment 
strategies was compared with cDMARDs. Incremental cost, incremental 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were calculated for each treatment sequence relative to cDMARDs. The 
cost-effectiveness of each strategy was determined using a US willingness-to-pay 
(WTP) threshold of $150,000/QALY.
RESULTS: For the base-case scenario, bDMARD treatment sequences were associated 
with greater treatment benefit (i.e. more QALYs), lower lost productivity costs, 
and greater treatment-related costs than cDMARDs. The expected ICERs for bDMARD 
sequences ranged from ∼$126,000 to $140,000 per QALY gained, which is below the 
US-specific WTP. Alternative scenarios examining the effects of homogeneous 
patients, dose increases, increased costs of hospitalization for severely 
physically impaired patients, and a lower baseline Health Assessment 
Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index score resulted in similar ICERs.
CONCLUSIONS: bDMARD treatment sequences are cost-effective from a US societal 
perspective.

BACKGROUND: A phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Daklinza 
(daclatasvir or DCV) in combination with sofosbuvir (SOF) for treatment of 
genotype (GT) 3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients.
AIM: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of DCV + SOF vs SOF in 
combination with ribavirin (RBV) over a 20-year time horizon from the 
perspective of a United States (US) payer.
METHODS: A published Markov model was adapted to reflect US demographic 
characteristics, treatment patterns, costs of drug acquisition, monitoring, 
disease and adverse event management, and mortality risks. Clinical inputs came 
from the ALLY-3 and VALENCE trials. The primary outcome was the incremental 
cost-utility ratio. Life-years, incidence of complications, number of patients 
achieving sustained virological response (SVR), and the total cost per SVR were 
secondary outcomes. Costs (2014 USD) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
were discounted at 3% per year. Deterministic, probabilistic, and scenario 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: DCV + SOF was associated with lower costs and better effectiveness than 
SOF + RBV in the base case and in almost all scenarios (i.e. 
treatment-experienced, non-cirrhotic, time horizons of 5, 10, and 80 years). 
DCV + SOF was less costly, but also slightly less effective than SOF + RBV in 
the cirrhotic and treatment-naïve population scenarios. Results were sensitive 
to variations in the probability of achieving SVR for both treatment arms. 
DCV + SOF costs less than $50,000 per QALY gained in 79% of all probabilistic 
iterations compared with SOF + RBV.
CONCLUSION: DCV + SOF is a dominant option compared with SOF + RBV in the US for 
the overall GT 3 HCV patient population.

Aortic dissection is a life threatening cardiovascular catastrophy. Its 
incidence estimated to 5-6 cases per 100,000 patients/year. The intimal tear 
happens at the ascending aorta in Type A, meanwhile at the aortic isthmus in 
Type B, but entry point may develop anywhere alongside the entire aorta. All 
types may affect a short aortic segment resulting in a localized false aneurysm, 
others separate the intimal layer at longer extension down to the visceral 
segment and far beyond to the femoral arteries. Dissection of orifices of side 
branches may lead to cerebral, upper extremity, spinal, visceral, renal and 
lower extremity malperfusion. These complications beyond the aortic rupture 
contribute significantly to high mortality of dissection. Today, first line 
treatment option in Type A dissection is surgery, but it can be endovascular or 
medical in Type B dissection. However, awareness of surgical procedures in this 
field remains inevitable. In this paper we summarize the surgical options for 
distal malperfusion affecting spinal, visceral, renal and lower extremity 
circulation.

Giant ascending aortic aneurysm is one of the worst lesions of the 
cardiovascular system. Timely surgical treatment provides the only chance to 
prolong the lives of such patients. Life expectancy without surgery in these 
patients is minimal; they die from a ruptured aneurysm.

Efficacy and safety of testosterone gel 2% (TG) were evaluated in two phase 3, 
open-labelled, single-arm, multicentre studies (000023 and extension study 
000077). Hypogonadal men having serum testosterone levels <300 ng/dl at two 
consecutive measurements were included. Study duration was 9 months (000023: 
3 months; 000077: 6 months). Starting dose of TG (46 mg) was applied on upper 
arm/shoulder. The primary endpoint (000023) was responder rate (subjects with 
average 24-hour serum testosterone concentration 300-1050 ng/dl on Day 90). 
Study 000077 evaluated the safety of TG in patients rolling over from study 
000023 over a period of 6 months. Of 180 subjects in 000023, 172 completed and 
145 rolled over to 000077, with 127 completers. The responder rate was 85.5%. 
Fewer subjects in 000077 (12.7%) versus 000023 (31.8%) had maximum testosterone 
concentration (Cmax ) >1500 ng/dl, with no significant safety concerns. 
Significant improvements in sexual function and quality of life were noted in 
both studies. Subjects experienced few skin reactions without notable increases 
in prostate-specific antigen and haematocrit levels. TG was efficacious with an 
acceptable safety profile. Cmax >1500 ng/dl did not exhibit distinct impact on 
safety parameters. However, further optimisation of titration schema to reduce 
Cmax is warranted while maintaining the average steady state total testosterone 
concentration.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether rituximab, an anti-B cell therapy, improves 
symptoms of fatigue and oral dryness in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome 
(SS).
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that included health economic analysis. 
Anti-Ro-positive patients with primary SS, symptomatic fatigue, and oral dryness 
were recruited from 25 UK rheumatology clinics from August 2011 to January 2014. 
Patients were centrally randomized to receive either intravenous (IV) placebo 
(250 ml saline) or IV rituximab (1,000 mg in 250 ml saline) in 2 courses at 
weeks 0, 2, 24, and 26, with pre- and postinfusion medication including 
corticosteroids. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving 
a 30% reduction in either fatigue or oral dryness at 48 weeks, as measured by 
visual analog scale. Other outcome measures included salivary and lacrimal flow 
rates, quality of life, scores on the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 
Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index and EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease 
Activity Index, symptoms of ocular and overall dryness, pain, globally assessed 
disease activity, and cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: All 133 patients who were randomized to receive placebo (n = 66) or 
rituximab (n = 67) were included in the primary analysis. Among patients with 
complete data, 21 of 56 placebo-treated patients and 24 of 61 rituximab-treated 
patients achieved the primary end point. After multiple imputation of missing 
outcomes, response rates in the placebo and rituximab groups were 36.8% and 
39.8%, respectively (adjusted odds ratio 1.13 [95% confidence interval 0.50, 
2.55]). There were no significant improvements in any outcome measure except for 
unstimulated salivary flow. The mean ± SD costs per patient for rituximab and 
placebo were £10,752 ± 264.75 and £2,672 ± 241.71, respectively. There were 
slightly more adverse events (AEs) reported in total for rituximab, but there 
was no difference in serious AEs (10 in each group).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that rituximab is neither 
clinically effective nor cost-effective in this patient population.

Patient factors and haemodialysis arteriovenous fistula outcomes.

Masengu A(1), Hanko J(1).

Author information:
(1)Regional Nephrology Unit, Level 11, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast, Northern 
Ireland - UK.

Arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) improve survival and morbidity for most 
haemodialysis (HD) patients. Are they better for all patients? In the 
enthusiastic pursuit of AVFs for all, concerns have been raised regarding high 
primary AVF failure rates, continued high incident central venous catheter (CVC) 
use in some countries, and the limited life expectancy of some HD patients. 
"Fistula first" is changing to "catheter last". The focus must be on decreasing 
AVF failure to mature and decreasing incident CVC use. An optimal outcome should 
be sought for each individual patient, and multiple failed attempts at AVF 
creation avoided.

INTRODUCTION: Brescia-Cimino radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) remains 
the first-choice vascular access procedure for patients in need of long-term 
hemodialysis. The average life expectancy of patients receiving hemodialysis has 
increased in recent years and many patients now live longer and require 
secondary or tertiary procedures. Elbow fistulas should only rarely be 
constructed as primary fistulas. The aim of the surgeon must be not only to 
achieve a functioning fistula, but to avoid possible complications other than 
failure to mature (FTM), like distal ischemia and cardiac failure and to save 
the vessels as much as possible for future procedures.
BACKGROUND: Both arterial and venous anatomy of the elbow and upper arm have 
significant variations. The surgeon must be aware of these variations during the 
operation, and try not to harm the vasculature of the extremity while trying to 
construct a functioning fistula. The main advantages of elbow fistulas are the 
opportunity to have multiple outflows, preservation of the major veins in their 
original place with no dissection and giving no harm to them, and having a 
longer outflow tract for cannulation.
CONCLUSIONS: In the elbow, beginning to construct an AVF with the perforating 
vein is the most advantageous. If the perforating vein is not available or has 
been used before, median cubital vein, its branches, median antecubital vein or 
other available nearby veins may be used depending on the anatomy. Perforating 
vein should be ligated if any other elbow vein is used to prevent flow to deep 
veins.

Size-Related Obligate and Facultative Parasitism in the Marine Gastropod 
Trichotropis cancellata.

Pernet B, Kohn AJ.

The marine gastropod Trichotropis cancellata, previously considered to be 
exclusively a suspension feeder, is also a kleptoparasite, stealing food from 
several species of suspension-feeding polychaetes. When feeding independently, 
T. cancellata uses its pseudoproboscis, an elongate, ciliated extension of the 
lower lip, to transport particles captured on its ctenidium to its mouth. When 
parasitizing, the snail positions its pseudoproboscis in the mouth of a host 
polychaete and diverts a large proportion of the particles captured by the 
polychaete to its own mouth. In subtidal habitats around San Juan Island, 
Washington, most individuals of T. cancellata are found in association with the 
tube openings of suspension-feeding polychaetes. In laboratory experiments, 
parasitism significantly enhanced fitness in T. cancellata. Juvenile snails that 
parasitized polychaetes grew faster and survived in greater numbers than those 
deprived of access to hosts, and parasitic adult snails reproduced more than 
those without hosts. Parasitism in T. cancellata and related capulid gastropods 
may have originated in early post-metamorphic stages as a response to 
constraints on the efficiency of suspension feeding at small sizes; however, 
because parasitism is more effective than suspension feeding for snails of all 
sizes, it now persists throughout life.

The absence of markers of inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) commonly 
predicts the absence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) central nervous system (CNS) 
infection. Consequently, multiple authors have proposed and validated criteria 
for deferring HSV PCR testing of CSF in immunocompetent hosts with normal CSF 
white blood cell and protein levels (≤5 cells/mm3 and ≤50 mg/dl, respectively). 
Hosts are considered immunocompetent if they are ≥2 years old and have not had 
HIV or an organ transplant. Adoption of the criteria may erroneously exclude 
HSV-infected persons from a necessary diagnostic test or, alternatively, reduce 
the costs associated with HSV tests with minimal to no effect on patient care. 
Little is known about the cost-effectiveness of this approach. A decision 
analysis model was developed to evaluate the adoption of criteria for screening 
HSV tests of CSF. Estimates of input parameter values combined available 
literature with a multiyear multisite review at two of the largest health care 
systems in the United States. Adoption of criteria to screen for HSV test need 
proved cost-effective when less than 1 in 200 patients deferred from testing 
truly had an HSV CNS infection. Similar to prior studies, none of the deferred 
cases had HSV encephalitis (n = 3120). Adoption of these criteria in the United 
States would save an estimated $127 million ($95 million to $158 million [±25%]) 
annually. The model calculations remained robust to variation in test cost, 
prevalence of HSV infection, and random variation to study assumptions. The 
adoption of criteria to screen HSV PCR tests in CSF represents a cost-effective 
approach.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the limitations with current patient-reported outcome 
measures (PROM) used to generate quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) in 
rheumatology, and set a research agenda.
METHODS: Two activities were undertaken. The first was a scoping review of 
published studies that have used PROM to generate QALY in rheumatology between 
2011 and 2016. The second was an interactive "eyeball test" exercise at Outcome 
Measures in Rheumatology 13 that compared subdomains of widely used generic 
PROM, as identified through the scoping review, to subdomains of the Assessment 
of SpondyloArthritis Health Index (ASAS-HI) condition-specific PROM for 
ankylosing spondylitis.
RESULTS: The scoping review included 39 studies. Five different PROM have been 
used to generate QALY in rheumatology; however, the EQ-5D and Short Form 6 
Dimensions (SF-6D) were used most frequently (in 32 and 9 of included studies, 
respectively). Special interest group participants identified energy/drive and 
sleep as 2 key subdomains of the ASAS-HI instrument that may be missed by the 
EQ-5D, and sexual function as potentially missed by the SF-6D. Participants also 
expressed concerns that aspects of the process of care and non-health outcomes 
may be missed. Three ways of incorporating additional subdomains were discussed, 
including using an alternative generic PROM, modifying an existing generic PROM 
with "bolt-on" subdomain(s), and generating societal weights for a 
condition-specific PROM.
CONCLUSION: Three priorities for future research were identified: understanding 
whether the EQ-5D and SF-6D identify what matters to patients with different 
rheumatic conditions, analyzing how much patients value process or non-health 
outcomes, and identifying which approaches to incorporating a greater number of 
subdomains into the QALY are being undertaken in other disease areas.

It is a long recognized fact that climatic variations, especially temperature, 
affect the life history of biting insects. This is particularly important when 
considering vector-borne diseases, especially in temperate regions where 
climatic fluctuations are large. In general, it has been found that most 
biological processes occur at a faster rate at higher temperatures, although not 
all processes change in the same manner. This differential response to 
temperature, often considered as a trade-off between onward transmission and 
vector life expectancy, leads to the total transmission potential of an infected 
vector being maximized at intermediate temperatures. Here we go beyond the 
concept of a static optimal temperature, and mathematically model how realistic 
temperature variation impacts transmission dynamics. We use bluetongue virus 
(BTV), under UK temperatures and transmitted by Culicoides midges, as a 
well-studied example where temperature fluctuations play a major role. We first 
consider an optimal temperature profile that maximizes transmission, and show 
that this is characterized by a warm day to maximize biting followed by cooler 
weather to maximize vector life expectancy. This understanding can then be 
related to recorded representative temperature patterns for England, the UK 
region which has experienced BTV cases, allowing us to infer historical 
transmissibility of BTV, as well as using forecasts of climate change to predict 
future transmissibility. Our results show that when BTV first invaded northern 
Europe in 2006 the cumulative transmission intensity was higher than any point 
in the last 50 years, although with climate change such high risks are the 
expected norm by 2050. Such predictions would indicate that regular BTV 
epizootics should be expected in the UK in the future.

Measuring variations and gaps in health and wellbeing across individuals, social 
groups and societies is a critical issue confronting social scientists in their 
quest to explain why gaps in health between the rich and the poor persist within 
and across societies. This article provides a systematic review of the 
measurement of inequalities and their implications on rural and remote health. A 
comprehensive literature review was conducted using online databases and other 
collections of published research on measuring health gaps between the rich and 
the poor in order to trace the development of this field of inquiry. Despite the 
enormous information on the subject area, it is not always easy to disentangle 
the independent effects of social class or socio-economic status (SES) on health 
inequalities from genetic or biological differences when analyzing 
racial/ethnic, gender or age gaps in mortality and morbidity. The meaning of SES 
or social class also varies from one culture to the other. Despite decades of 
work in this field, it is not clear what it is about SES or social class that is 
associated with inequalities in health. Is it simply a question of access to 
resources? And on the issue of measurement, studies from various disciplines 
have shown that it is important to employ a raft of measures in order to measure 
and present the distributions fully from various angles and value judgments. In 
the rural African context, tackling vertical and horizontal inequalities in 
health requires tackling the root causes of poverty and promoting social 
policies that empower individuals and communities. Hence, the review discusses 
recent methodological developments that hold promise for addressing the 
knowledge gap that remain. We hope that researchers will reflect on the dynamics 
in measures of inequalities discussed in this paper as they continue to assess 
the status of health in Africa's contemporary and largely dominated rural 
population.

Düsseldorf, 40225, Düsseldorf, Germany. Sebastian.Honnen@hhu.de.

In view of increased life expectancy the risk for disturbed integrity of genetic 
information increases. This inevitably holds the implication for higher 
incidence of age-related diseases leading to considerable cost increase in 
health care systems. To develop preventive strategies it is crucial to evaluate 
external and internal noxae as possible threats to our DNA. Especially the 
interplay of DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair (DR) mechanisms needs 
further deciphering. Moreover, there is a distinct need for alternative in vivo 
test systems for basic research and also risk assessment in toxicology. 
Especially the evaluation of combinational toxicity of environmentally present 
genotoxins and adverse effects of clinically used DNA damaging anticancer drugs 
is a major challenge for modern toxicology. This review focuses on the 
applicability of Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to unravel and 
tackle scientific questions related to the biological consequences of genotoxin 
exposure and highlights methods for studying DDR and DR. In this regard 
large-scale in vivo screens of mixtures of chemicals and extensive parallel 
sequencing are highlighted as unique advantages of C. elegans. In addition, 
concise information regarding evolutionary conserved molecular mechanisms of the 
DDR and DR as well as currently available data obtained from the use of 
prototypical genotoxins and preferential read-outs of genotoxin testing are 
discussed. The use of established protocols, which are already available in the 
community, is encouraged to facilitate and further improve the implementation of 
C. elegans as a powerful genetic model system in genetic toxicology and 
biomedicine.

This article discusses, from a psychological perspective, the life experience of 
the adult and ageing person with haemophilia, including psychological issues, 
aspects of his personal and social integration, decision-making, communication 
and other factors that may affect treatment adherence and quality of life. The 
aim was to provide haematologists and healthcare staff with knowledge and 
resources to improve communication and support for adult persons with 
haemophilia, and raise awareness on psychosocial issues related to quality of 
life, sexuality and aspects associated with ageing with haemophilia. Adulthood 
is a period of many personal and social changes, and ageing with haemophilia is 
a relatively new phenomenon due to increased life expectancy in this population. 
Patients have to adapt to the disease continuously when facing new expectations, 
life projects and issues arising with increasing age, so the healthcare team 
should be ready to provide support. A good therapeutic alliance with the patient 
must be accompanied by assessment and counselling in aspects including 
satisfaction, perceived difficulties and barriers, and emotional needs. Raising 
awareness of all this will result in the patient benefiting from the recent 
improvements in treatments.

The second epidemiologic transition on the brink: What we can learn from the 
island of Newfoundland during the early 20th century.

Schmidt DM(1), Sattenspiel L(1).

Missouri.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to understand how the second epidemiologic transition 
unfolded on the island of Newfoundland during the early 20th century. The focus 
is on changes in predominant causes of mortality throughout this period, urban 
and rural differences, and comparisons with other Western nations. We explore 
factors driving these patterns including the economy, nutrition, sanitation, and 
access to healthcare and discuss their relevance to understanding epidemiologic 
transitions in other developing regions.
METHODS: We examined official provincial death records (n = 65,394) and census 
materials from 1900 to 1939 for three rural districts (Burgeo-La Poile, 
Bonavista, and Twillingate) and the large city of St. John's. Life expectancies, 
infant mortality rates, survival curves, and proportionate mortality from 
communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were calculated.
RESULTS: In all districts, old age mortality increased while infant and 
childhood mortality decreased, with corresponding increases in life expectancy. 
Proportionate mortality from communicable causes decreased while deaths from 
NCDs increased. These changes occurred earlier in urban St. John's than in 
outlying districts, suggesting rural-urban differences played a significant role 
in Newfoundland's second epidemiologic transition. However, the transition was 
significantly delayed relative to other Western nations.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that observed mortality patterns were the result of 
complex interactions between the poor economy, malnutrition, high prevalence of 
tuberculosis, and limited health and social services. These factors contribute 
to the delayed onset of the second epidemiologic transition in Newfoundland 
relative to other Western nations and the earlier onset in St. John's than in 
rural areas.

Author information:

Organization , Ibaraki , Japan.

High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) process, as a nonthermal process, can be used to 
inactivate microbes while minimizing chemical reactions in food. In this regard, 
a HHP level of 100 MPa (986.9 atm/1019.7 kgf/cm2) and more is applied to food. 
Conventional thermal process damages food components relating color, flavor, and 
nutrition via enhanced chemical reactions. However, HHP process minimizes the 
damages and inactivates microbes toward processing high quality safe foods. The 
first commercial HHP-processed foods were launched in 1990 as fruit products 
such as jams, and then some other products have been commercialized: retort rice 
products (enhanced water impregnation), cooked hams and sausages (shelf life 
extension), soy sauce with minimized salt (short-time fermentation owing to 
enhanced enzymatic reactions), and beverages (shelf life extension). The 
characteristics of HHP food processing are reviewed from viewpoints of 
nonthermal process, history, research and development, physical and biochemical 
changes, and processing equipment.

Life expectancy at birth is a synthetic mortality indicator that reflects the 
general living conditions of the population. Changes in mortality by age and 
causes of death generate no explicit changes in the indicator. The application 
of a decomposition method can bring light to the analysis of the phenomenon. The 
aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of age groups and causes of 
death in the variation in life expectancy at birth, for men and women, from 2000 
to 2010, by applying Pollard's decomposition method. Brazilian life tables were 
obtained from IBGE and death data from SIM. The results indicate that the age 
group that most contributed to the increase in life expectancy was of less than 
1 year old. Among the defined causes, cardiovascular diseases were responsible 
for the largest increase in life expectancy.

Economic evaluation of nivolumab as a second-line treatment for advanced renal 
cell carcinoma from US and Chinese perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Nivolumab is a new standard of care for patients with metastatic 
renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and provides an overall survival benefit of 5.40 
months in comparison with everolimus. This study evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of nivolumab for the second-line treatment of mRCC from the 
perspective of US payers and identified the range of drug costs for which the 
addition of nivolumab to standard therapy could be considered cost-effective 
from a Chinese perspective.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was constructed to estimate lifetime 
costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were estimated 
for the US and Chinese health care systems. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Nivolumab provided an additional 0.29 QALYs at a cost of $151,676/QALY 
in the United States. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, at the current cost of nivolumab, 
the chance of nivolumab being cost-effective was 3.10%. For China, when 
nivolumab cost less than $7.90 or $9.70/mg, there was a nearly 90% likelihood 
that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for nivolumab would be less than 
$22,785 or $48,838/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: For the United States, nivolumab is unlikely to be a high-value 
treatment for mRCC at the current price, and a price reduction appears to be 
justified. In China, value-based prices for nivolumab are $7.90 and $9.70/mg for 
the country and Beijing City, respectively. This study could and should inform 
the multilateral drug-price negotiations in China that may be upcoming for 
nivolumab. Cancer 2017;123:2634-41. © 2017 American Cancer Society.

How are health inequalities articulated across urban and rural spaces in 
Tanzania? This research paper explores the variations, differences, and 
inequalities, in Tanzania's health outcomes-to question both the idea of an 
urban advantage in health and the extent of urban-rural inequalities in health. 
The three research objectives aim to understand: what are the health differences 
(morbidity and mortality) between Tanzania's urban and rural areas; how are 
health inequalities articulated within Tanzania's urban and rural areas; and how 
are health inequalities articulated across age groups for rural-urban Tanzania? 
By analyzing four national datasets of Tanzania (National Census, Household 
Budget Survey, Demographic Health Survey, and Health Demographic Surveillance 
System), this paper reflects on the outcomes of key health indicators across 
these spaces. The datasets include national surveys conducted from 2009 to 2012. 
The results presented showcase health outcomes in rural and urban areas vary, 
and are unequal. The risk of disease, life expectancy, and unhealthy behaviors 
are not the same for urban and rural areas, and across income groups. Urban 
areas show a disadvantage in life expectancy, HIV prevalence, maternal 
mortality, children's morbidity, and women's BMI. Although a greater level of 
access to health facilities and medicine is reported, we raise a general concern 
of quality and availability in health services; what data sources are being used 
to make decisions on urban-rural services, and the wider determinants of urban 
health outcomes. The results call for a better understanding of the 
sociopolitical and economic factors contributing to these inequalities. The 
urban, and rural, populations are diverse; therefore, we need to look at service 
quality, and use, in light of inequality: what services are being accessed; by 
whom; for what reasons?

Allocation policy of female freshwater pearl mussels.

Bauer G(1).

Living exclusively in trout streams which are very poor in nutrients, freshwater 
pearl mussels are physiologically adapted to the low food supply by a reduced 
metabolism. Longevity of these mussels spans decades and life-time fecundity of 
females is very high (up to 2*108 larvae). Their resource allocation policy 
favours survival over current reproduction. Reproductive effort (per 
reproductive period) falls within the lowest range of values reported for 
molluscs (0.8-5.3% of the total organic substance). The soft parts (without 
larvae) of reproducing females are heavier compared to pausing ones, indicating 
that only those females reproduce which exceed a threshold value of body weight. 
The more they exceed this value the more larvae they produce. Surplus energy 
(the amount above the threshold) is not completely devoted to reproduction but 
is in part invested in somatic functions. At the population level this 
allocation system results in largely size independent fecundity values, varying 
considerably between individuals and in a variable percentage (5-54%) of females 
taking part in reproduction every year. The evolution of this system must be 
attributed to the reduced metabolism and growth. This provides the basis for a 
very long life accompanied with many spawning periods. Accordingly fitness can 
be improved by extending longevity.
