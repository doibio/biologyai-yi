demonstrating that elevated serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
concentration in elderly is associated with some better health outcomes. This 
elevation is somewhat physiological as aging. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the heart rate (HR) response during a graded exercise test and its 
recovery in healthy elderly, comparing subjects within serum TSH in the lower 
limit of reference range to those within the TSH in the upper limit.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 86 healthy 
elderly aged 71.5 ± 5.1 years, with serum TSH between 0.4 - 4.0 mUl/mL. The 
participants were divided into two groups according to TSH level: < 1.0 mUl/mL 
(n = 13) and ≥ 1.0 µUI/mL (n = 73). All participants performed an ergometric 
test on a treadmill. The HR was recorded and analyzed at rest, during exercise 
and during the three minutes immediately after exercise.
RESULTS: No differences were observed in relation to HR at peak of exercise (TSH 
< 1.0 µUI/mL: 133.9 ± 22.5 bpm vs. TSH ≥ 1.0 µUI/mL: 132.4 ± 21.3 bpm; p = 0.70) 
and during the first minute of recovery phase (TSH < 1.0 µUI/mL: 122.3 ± 23.1 
bpm vs. TSH ≥ 1.0 µUI/mL: 115.7 ± 18.4 bpm p = 0.33). The groups also presented 
similar chronotropic index (TSH < 1.0 µUI/mL: 78.1 ± 30.6 vs. TSH ≥ 1.0 µUI/mL: 
79.5 ± 26.4; p = 0.74).
CONCLUSION: In this sample studied, there were no difference between lower and 
upper TSH level concerning HR response during rest, peak of exercise and 
exercise recovery.

The growth of the urban population raises concern about municipal public 
managers in the sense of providing emergency medical services (EMS) that are 
aligned with the needs of prehospital emergency medical care demanded by the 
population. The literature review aims at presenting the response time of 
emergency medical services in several parts of the world and discussing some 
factors that interfere in the result of this indicator such as GDP (Gross 
Domestic Product) percentage spent on health and life expectancy of countries. 
The study will also show that in some of the consulted articles, authors suggest 
to EMS recommendations for decreasing the response time using simulations, 
heuristics and metaheuristics. Response time is a basic indicator of emergency 
medical services, in such a way that researchers use the descriptive statistics 
to evaluate this parameter. Europe and the USA outstand in the publication of 
studies that present this information. Some articles use stochastic and 
mathematical methods to suggest models that simulate scenarios of response time 
reduction and suggest such proposals to the local EMS. Countries in which the 
response time was identified have a high index of human development and life 
expectancy between 74.7 and 83.7 years.

IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that patients with 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis are eligible for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) if 
the 30-day surgical complication rate is less than 3% and the patient's life 
expectancy is at least 5 years.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a risk prediction tool to improve patient selection for 
CEA among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, veterans 65 years and 
older who received both carotid imaging and CEA in the Veterans Administration 
between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009 (n = 2325) were followed up for 5 
years. Data were analyzed from January 2005 to December 2015. A risk prediction 
tool (the Carotid Mortality Index [CMI]) based on 23 candidate variables 
identified in the literature was developed using Veterans Administration and 
Medicare data. A simpler model based on the number of 4 key comorbidities that 
were prevalent and strongly associated with 5-year mortality was also developed 
(any cancer in the past 5 years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease [the 4C model]). Model 
performance was assessed using measures of discrimination (eg, area under the 
curve [AUC]) and calibration. Internal validation was performed by correcting 
for optimism using 500 bootstrapped samples.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Five-year mortality.
RESULTS: Among 2325 veterans, the mean (SD) age was 73.74 (5.92) years. The 
cohort was predominantly male (98.8%) and of white race/ethnicity (94.4%). 
Overall, 29.5% (n = 687) of patients died within 5 years of CEA. On the basis of 
a backward selection algorithm, 9 patient characteristics were selected (age, 
chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, any 
cancer diagnosis in the past 5 years, congestive heart failure, atrial 
fibrillation, remote stroke or transient ischemic attack, and body mass index) 
for the final logistic model, which yielded an optimism-corrected AUC of 0.687 
for the CMI. The 4C model had slightly worse discrimination (AUC, 0.657) 
compared with the CMI model; however, the calibration curve was similar to the 
full model in most of the range of predicted probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: According to results of this study, use of the CMI or 
the simpler 4C model may improve patient selection for CEA among patients with 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Screening Mammography Among Older Women: A Review of United States Guidelines 
and Potential Harms.

In the United States, older women (aged ≥65 years) continue to receive routine 
screening mammography surveillance, despite limited evidence supporting the 
benefits to this subpopulation. This article reviews screening mammography 
guidelines and the potential harms of such screening for older women in the 
United States. Published guidelines and recommendations on screening mammography 
for older women from professional medical societies and organizations in the 
United States were reviewed from the mid-20th century to present. Observational 
data were then synthesized to present the documented harms from screening 
mammography among older women. In 1976, the American Cancer Society recommended 
to screen all women aged ≥40 years with no upper age limit. With time, other 
major U.S. medical societies adopted their own screening guidelines without a 
consensus on age of screening cessation. A population-wide screening effort has 
largely continued without an upper age limit and with it, a growing body of 
literature on the harms of screening older women. Reported harms from screening 
mammography procedures have included physical pain, psychological distress, 
excessive use of health services from overdiagnoses/false positives, and undue 
financial expenses. These costs are particularly pronounced among special 
populations with limited life expectancies such as those of very advanced age 
≥80 years, long-term nursing home residents, and the cognitively impaired. When 
potential harms, remaining life years, and the viability of available treatments 
are considered, the burdens of screening mammography often outweigh the benefits 
for older women. For some cases, an individualized approach to recommendations 
would be appropriate. National guidelines should be updated to provide clear 
guidance for screening women of advanced age, especially those in special 
populations with limited life expectancies.

Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL) is marketed in the US since 2008, and a non-live 
adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV) was approved in 2017. Literature 
suggests that waning of ZVL efficacy may necessitate additional vaccination. The 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended vaccination with RZV in 
immunocompetent adults aged 50+ years old, including those previously vaccinated 
with ZVL. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
vaccinating US adults aged 60+ years old, previously vaccinated with ZVL. The 
ZOster ecoNomic Analysis (ZONA) model, a deterministic Markov model, was adapted 
to follow a hypothetical 1 million(M)-person cohort of US adults previously 
vaccinated with ZVL. Model inputs included demographics, epidemiology, vaccine 
characteristics, utilities and costs. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were presented over the lifetimes of the cohort from the year of 
additional vaccination, discounted 3% annually. The model estimated that, 
vaccination with RZV 5 years after previous vaccination with ZVL, would reduce 
disease burden compared with no additional vaccination, resulting in a gain of 
1,633 QALYs at a total societal cost of $96M (incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio: $58,793/QALY saved). Compared with revaccinating with ZVL, vaccination 
with RZV would result in a gain of 1,187 QALYs and societal cost savings of 
almost $84M. Sensitivity, scenario, and threshold analyses demonstrated 
robustness of these findings. Vaccination with RZV is predicted to be 
cost-effective relative to no additional vaccination, assuming a threshold of 
$100,000/QALY, and cost-saving relative to ZVL revaccination of US adults aged 
60+ years old who have been previously vaccinated with ZVL.

OBJECTIVE: Surgical technique process innovations are expected to generally 
incur no additional cost but gain better quality. Whether a mini-laparotomy 
surgery (MLS) in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) is more cost effective 
than conventional open surgery had not been well examined. The objective of this 
study was to apply cost-effectiveness approaches to investigate the cost 
effectiveness of adopting MLS compared with open surgery 1 year following 
resection in CRC patients.
RESEARCH DESIGN: A prospective non-randomized cohort study design.
SETTING: An academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 224 patients who received elective MLS and 339 who 
received conventional surgery; after propensity score matching, 212 pairs were 
included for analysis.
INTERVENTION: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost measures were hospital-index cost and outpatient and 
inpatient costs within 1 year after discharge. Effectiveness measures were 
life-years (LYs) gained and quality-adjusted life-year (QALYs) gained.
STATISTICAL METHODS: We calculated incremental costs and effectiveness by 
differences in these values between MLS and conventional surgery using adjusted 
predicted estimates.
RESULTS: MLS patients had lower rates of blood transfusions, less complication, 
and shorter post-surgical lengths of stay and more medical cost savings. 
One-year overall medical costs for MLS patients were TWD 748,269 (USD 24,942) 
per QALY gained, significant lower than for the comparison group (p-value = 
0.045).
CONCLUSION: Our findings supported that the less invasive surgical process 
through MLS not only saved medical costs, but also increased QALYs for surgical 
treatment in CRC patients.

Migraine is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders among all age 
groups including the elderly, but the incidence and prevalence of migraine tend 
to decrease with age. The clinical phenotype of migraine also appears to be 
different in the elderly patient group in comparison to the younger patient 
group, with elderly migraine appearing to be more often bilateral and associated 
with what has become known as "late-life migraine accompaniments. Furthermore, 
difficulty in the differentiation of migraine from vascular insults such as 
transient ischemic attacks and amyloid angiopathy and other multiple 
comorbidities, polypharmacy and age-related changes in pharmacodynamics and 
pharmacokinetics makes treatments for this cohort challenging but necessary, 
especially given the worldwide increase in life expectancy, and likelihood of 
migraine continuing to be a major personal and public health problem.

BACKGROUND:  The need for plastic and reconstructive surgery on elderly patients 
has been on the rise due to an increase in life expectancy in the past decades. 
Therefore, a study was conducted on young and elderly patients following 
microsurgical extremity reconstructions with free gracilis muscle flaps with the 
primary aim to investigate the influence of age and the American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) score on the general outcome, as well as surgical and 
medical complications.
METHODS:  A retrospective analysis of 153 patients receiving free gracilis 
muscle flaps for extremity reconstructions between November 2009 and January 
2018 was performed at two partner institutions specialized in microsurgical 
reconstructions. A logistic regression analysis was performed to correlate age 
and the ASA score with postoperative complication probability. Patients younger 
than 70 years were directly compared with elderly patients with respect to age, 
gender, ASA score, preexisting comorbidities, localization, and postoperative 
medical and surgical complications.
RESULTS:  Age turned out to be not significantly associated with major flap 
complications (p = 0.925) but with higher ASA scores (p = 0.016). However, an 
age-related significant increase in minor flap complications could be observed 
in the elderly (p = 0.008). A significant correlation between minor medical 
complications and age could be observed (p = 0.001) in contrast to ASA score 
(p = 0.912).
CONCLUSION:  An increased minor flap, as well as minor and major medical 
complications, must be expected in extremity reconstructions with free gracilis 
flaps in elderly patients. Higher ASA scores correlate with a higher incidence 
of major flap complications. Septuagenarians are more prone to develop 
perioperative major medical complications than patients younger than 70 years. 
Age and general medical condition, coupled with the performance of each patient, 
should be thoroughly assessed individually to facilitate a tailored 
reconstructive approach using risk assessment tools and established scoring 
systems.

As an important base excision repair (BER) enzyme, uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) 
can repair the uracil-induced DNA lesion and maintain the genomic integrity. 
Herein, we have proposed a sensitive UDG assay based on the terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-assisted formation of fluorescent copper 
nanoclusters (CuNCs). In this study, a uracil-containing stem-loop DNA substrate 
is rationally designed with its 3'-end blocked with 2', 3'-dideoxycytosine 
(ddC). UDG can remove the uracil in the DNA substrate to generate an 
apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, which can then be specifically cleaved by 
endonuclease IV (Endo IV) to expose a 3'-OH terminus. TdT will initiate the 
template-free DNA extension along the exposed 3'-OH terminus to produce a quite 
long poly(T) tail, which will perfectly template the production of fluorescent 
CuNCs. By recording the fluorescence of the CuNCs, the UDG activity can be 
faithfully detected. In contrast, if UDG is absent, the 3'-ddC terminus of the 
DNA substrate cannot be recognized by TdT and thus no TdT-based extension and 
formation of CuNCs will occur. The use of ddC as a 3'-end blocker can greatly 
decrease the nonspecific DNA extension and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. 
Furthermore, TdT is a template-free and sequence-independent DNA polymerase, 
which can effectively catalyze the tailing process up to a maximum of thousands 
of thymines, and each tail can form many fluorescent CuNCs. Therefore, an 
ultrahigh sensitivity is achieved and as low as 0.00005 U/mL of UDG can be 
clearly detected. Moreover, with an additional AP site-contained poly(A) 
oligonucleotide during TdT-mediated extension, a branched amplification 
mechanism is also preliminarily devised, which can further push the detection 
limit of UDG to an extremely low level of 0.000002 U/mL.

Background and Purpose- Recent guidelines have suggested the potential benefit 
of intravenous thrombolysis in stroke patients with systemic malignancy who have 
a reasonable life expectancy of >6 months. However, it is difficult to determine 
which patients with cancer will have a life expectancy of >6 months. Therefore, 
we identified the factors associated with 6-month mortality in patients with 
acute ischemic stroke and systemic malignancy. Methods- Consecutive stroke 
patients with systemic malignancy were retrospectively analyzed. We classified 
the patients into 3 groups: the nonactive cancer, active nonmetastatic cancer, 
and metastatic cancer groups. We compared the baseline characteristics and 
6-month survival rates. Results- Of the 468 ischemic stroke patients with 
systemic malignancy during an 8-year period, 223 patients had nonactive cancer, 
105 patients had active nonmetastatic cancer, and 140 patients had metastasis. 
During the 6-month follow-up, 122 patients (26.1%) died (nonactive cancer group 
[7.2%, 16/223], active nonmetastatic cancer group [11.4%, 12/105], and 
metastatic cancer group [67.1%, 94/140]). Multivariate Cox regression analysis 
revealed that the presence of metastasis (hazard ratio, 4.527; 95% CI, 
2.175-9.422) was independently associated with 6-month mortality. However, the 
active nonmetastatic cancer group exhibited similar 6-month mortality to the 
nonactive cancer group (hazard ratio, 0.711; 95% CI, 0.282-1.795). 
Gastric/esophageal cancer and pancreatic cancer were also independently 
associated with 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 2.068 and 2.389, respectively). 
Conclusions- In stroke patients with active cancer, the presence of metastasis 
and the cancer type were crucial factors associated with 6-month mortality.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) may lead to visual loss and blindness. 
Several pharmacological treatments are available on the National Health Service 
(NHS) to United Kingdom patients affected by this condition, including 
intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGFs) and two 
types of intravitreal steroid implants, releasing dexamethasone or fluocinolone 
acetonide (FAc). This study aimed to assess the value for money 
(cost-effectiveness) of the FAc 0.2 μg/day implant (ILUVIEN®) in patients with 
chronic DMO considered insufficiently responsive to other therapies.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model with a 15-year time horizon to estimate the 
impact of changes in best-corrected visual acuity in DMO patients on costs and 
quality-adjusted life years. The model considered both eyes, designated as the 
"study eye", defined at model entry as phakic with an ongoing cataract formation 
or pseudophakic, and the "fellow eye". The model compared the FAc 0.2 μg/day 
implant with a 700 μg dexamethasone implant (pseudophakic patients only) or with 
usual care, defined as a mixture of laser photocoagulation and anti-VEGFs 
(phakic and pseudophakic patients). Costs were estimated from the perspective of 
the NHS and Personal Social Services; full NHS prices were used for drugs.
RESULTS: In patients who were pseudophakic at baseline, at 36 months, the FAc 
implant provided an additional gain of 4.01 and 3.64 Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters compared with usual care and the dexamethasone 
implant, respectively. Over the 15-year time horizon, this translated into 0.185 
additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an extra cost of £3066 
compared with usual care, and 0.126 additional QALYs at an extra cost of £1777 
compared with dexamethasone. Thus, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
were £16,609 and £14,070 per QALY gained vs. usual care and dexamethasone, 
respectively. In patients who were phakic at baseline, the FAc 0.2 μg/day 
implant provided an additional gain of 2.96 ETDRS letters at 36 months compared 
with usual care, which, over 15 years, corresponded to 0.11 additional QALYs at 
an extra cost of £3170, resulting in an ICER of £28,751 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: The FAc 0.2 μg/day implant provided good value for money compared 
with other established treatments, especially in pseudophakic patients.

Objective Dementia is a major cause of disruption for a healthy life expectancy 
in Japan. It has been suggested that the number of teeth is a modifiable risk 
factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. We therefore examined the possible 
association between the cognitive function and the number of natural and 
artificial teeth in community-dwelling Japanese elderly individuals. Methods 
Among the participants in our prospective, community-based study, 210 elderly 
individuals (103 men and 107 women; 78.1±4.9 years; mean age±standard deviation) 
underwent both dental examinations and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 
as well as various medical checkups, in 2016 and 2017. Results The number of 
natural teeth was significantly associated with an individual's MMSE score. The 
percentage of cognitively normal subjects (MMSE scores: 27-30) decreased 
significantly with a decrease in the number of natural teeth. Among the MMSE 
items, the calculation ability was significantly and independently associated 
with the number of natural teeth. Regression was calculated as the predicted 
score of MMSE =21+0.3× (years of schooling) +0.1× (number of natural teeth). 
Among individuals with 19 or fewer natural teeth, those who had a total of 20 
teeth or more, including both natural and artificial teeth, had significantly 
higher MMSE scores than those who had 19 or fewer natural and artificial teeth 
combined. Conclusion The number of natural teeth was significantly associated 
with the cognitive function, especially the calculation ability, and the use of 
artificial teeth was associated with the preservation of the cognitive function 
in community-dwelling elderly individuals.

Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a rare congenital disorder that 
associates with dental manifestations of anodontia, hypodontia, and atrophic 
alveolar ridges. Although the disorder does not affect the life expectancy of 
the patient, it poses tremendous challenges on the patient's physical and 
psychosocial development. Early and multidisciplinary dental care can benefit 
HED children's development and improve their quality of life. This study 
presents two cases addressing the dental management continuously for 10 to 13 
years in the dental school clinics. The keys to long-term success of the oral 
care program for HED patients at different age phases are reviewed and 
discussed, which can be summarized as early intervention, multidisciplinary 
collaborative care, and continuous recall.

The ontogenesis and reproduction of plants cultivated aboard a spacecraft occur 
inside the unique closed ecological system wherein plants are subjected to 
serious abiotic stresses. For the first time, a comparative molecular 
cytogenetic analysis of Pisum sativum L. (Fabaceae) grown on board the RS ISS 
during the Expedition-14 and Expedition-16 and also plants of their succeeding 
(F1 and F2) generations cultivated on Earth was performed in order to reveal 
possible structural chromosome changes in the pea genome. The karyotypes of 
these plants were studied by multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) with five different repeated DNA sequences (45S rDNA, 5S rDNA, PisTR-B/1, 
microsatellite motifs (AG)12, and (GAA)9) as probes. A chromosome aberration was 
revealed in one F1 plant. Significant changes in distribution of the examined 
repeated DNAs in karyotypes of the "space grown" pea plants as well as in F1 and 
F2 plants cultivated on Earth were not observed if compared with control plants. 
Additional oligo-(GAA)9 sites were detected on chromosomes 6 and 7 in karyotypes 
of F1 and F2 plants. The detected changes might be related to intraspecific 
genomic polymorphism or plant cell adaptive responses to spaceflight-related 
stress factors. Our findings suggest that, despite gradual total trace 
contamination of the atmosphere on board the ISS associated with the extension 
of the space station operating life, exposure to the space environment did not 
induce serious chromosome reorganizations in genomes of the "space grown" pea 
plants and generations of these plants cultivated on Earth.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Classifying brain tumors is challenging, but recently 
developed imaging techniques offer the opportunity for neuroradiologists and 
neurosurgeons to diagnose, differentiate, and manage different types of brain 
tumors. Such advances will be reflected in improvements in patients' life 
expectancy and quality of life. Among the newest techniques, the apparent 
diffusion coefficient (ADC), which tracks the rate of microscopic water 
diffusion within tissues, has become a focus of investigation. Recently, ADC has 
been used as a preoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
parameter that facilitates tumor diagnosis and grading. Here, we aimed to 
determine the ADC cutoff values for pediatric brain tumors (PBTs) categorized 
according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 80 cases, and assessed them 
based on their MRI-derived ADC. These results were compared with those of WHO 
classification-based histopathology.
RESULTS: Whole-lesion ADC values ranged 0.225-1.240 × 10-3 mm2/s for ependymal 
tumors, 0.107-1.571 × 10-3 mm2/s for embryonal tumors, 
0.1065-2.37801 × 10-3 mm2/s for diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, 
0.5220-0.7840 × 10-3 mm2/s for other astrocytic tumors, and 
0.1530-0.8160 × 10-3 mm2/s for meningiomas. These findings revealed the 
usefulness of ADC in the differential diagnosis of PBT, as it was able to 
discriminate between five types of PBTs.
CONCLUSION: The application of an ADC diagnostic criterion would reduce the need 
for spectroscopic analysis. However, further research is needed to implement ADC 
in the differential diagnosis of PBT.

Although studies have shown that air pollution can be devastating to population 
health, little is known about the health implications of the intersection of air 
pollution and income inequality. We investigate if air pollution is especially 
detrimental to the health of US state populations characterized by more 
inequitable distributions of income. In other words, are the populations of 
states with higher levels of income inequality especially vulnerable to similar 
levels of air pollution? We use two-way fixed-effects panel regression 
techniques to analyze longitudinal data for 49 US states and the District of 
Columbia (2000-2010) to model state-level life expectancy as a function of fine 
particulate matter, income inequality, and other state-level factors. We 
estimate models with interaction terms to formally assess whether the 
association between fine particulate matter and life expectancy varies by level 
of state income inequality. Across multiple life expectancy outcomes and 
additive models, states with higher PM2.5 levels tend to exhibit lower average 
life expectancy. This general pattern is observed with our specifications for 
raw and weighted PM2.5 and with adjustments for income share of the top 10%, 
total population, GDP per capita, median household income, median age, percent 
college degree or higher, percent black, and percent Hispanic/Latino. We also 
find that the association between state PM2.5 levels and average life expectancy 
intensifies in states with higher levels of income inequality. More 
specifically, PM2.5 levels are more detrimental to population life expectancy in 
states where a higher percentage of income is concentrated in the top 10% of the 
state income distribution. We discuss the implications of our results for future 
research in social epidemiology and environmental justice.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by 
degeneration of spinal motor neurons resulting in variable degrees of muscular 
wasting and weakness. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the 
survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. Caenorhabditis elegans mutants lacking SMN 
recapitulate several aspects of the disease including impaired movement and 
shorted life span. We examined whether genes previously implicated in life span 
extension conferred benefits to C. elegans lacking SMN. We find that reducing 
daf-2/insulin receptor signaling activity promotes survival and improves 
locomotor behavior in this C. elegans model of SMA. The locomotor dysfunction in 
C. elegans lacking SMN correlated with structural and functional abnormalities 
in GABAergic neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Moreover, we demonstrated that 
reduction in daf-2 signaling reversed these abnormalities. Remarkably, enhancing 
GABAergic neurotransmission alone was able to correct the locomotor dysfunction. 
Our work indicated that an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory activity within 
motor circuits and underlies motor system dysfunction in this SMA model. 
Interventions aimed at restoring the balance of excitatory/inhibitory activity 
in motor circuits could be of benefit to individuals with SMA.

Mucoviscidosis or cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most frequent monogenetic 
diseases in middle Europe. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. 
A defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 
channel reduces chloride ion transport to the cell membrane, which leads to 
malfunctions in all exocrine glands. This results in a progressive multiorgan 
disease, which leads to chronic inflammation and infections of the lungs. The 
progressive destruction of lung tissue with respiratory insufficiency is the 
most common cause of death in CF. Progress in symptomatic treatment over the 
past decades has led to a dramatic improvement in life expectation and quality 
of life for those affected, so that nowadays in nearly all industrial countries 
the majority of patients are adults. In 2012 the era of causal therapy of the 
CFTR protein defects was opened with the approval of ivacaftor. Long-term data 
now confirm the benefits. There is reason to hope that the success story of CF 
treatment will be continued, particularly by further CFTR modulators with 
innovative modes of action and improved efficacy; however, so far these are not 
available for all mutation classes, so that not all patients can reap the 
benefits. Therefore, the further development of symptomatic treatment becomes of 
great importance due to the complications that have already occurred before the 
implementation of the CFTR modulators. The implementation of modulators in early 
childhood can attenuate or prevent early irreversible complications. Therefore, 
in this article special emphasis is placed on new developments in symptomatic 
treatment and on new treatment options.

Marine mammals, such as whales, have a high proportion of body fat and so are 
susceptible to the accumulation, and associated detrimental health effects, of 
lipophilic environmental contaminants. Recently, we developed a wild-type cell 
line from humpback whale fibroblasts (HuWa). Extensive molecular assessments 
with mammalian wild-type cells are typically constrained by a finite life span, 
with cells eventually becoming senescent. Thus, the present work explored the 
possibility of preventing senescence in the HuWa cell line by transfection with 
plasmids encoding the simian virus large T antigen (SV40T) or telomerase reverse 
transcriptase (TERT). No stable expression was achieved upon SV40 transfection. 
Transfection with TERT, on the other hand, activated the expression of 
telomerase in HuWa cells. At the time of manuscript preparation, the transfected 
HuWa cells (HuWaTERT) have been stable for at least 59 passages 
post-transfection. HuWaTERT proliferate rapidly and maintain initial cell 
characteristics, such as morphology and chromosomal stability. The response of 
HuWaTERT cells to an immune stimulant (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) and an 
immunotoxicant (Aroclor1254) was assessed by measurement of intracellular levels 
of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumour necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α. HuWaTERT cells constitutively express IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα. 
Exposure to neither LPS nor Aroclor1254 had an effect on the levels of these 
cytokines. Overall, this work supports the diverse applicability of HuWa cell 
lines in that they display reliable long-term preservation, susceptibility to 
exogenous gene transfer and enable the study of humpback whale-specific cellular 
response mechanisms.

The mechanical hypothesis of septal aperture formation tested in an early 
medieval population from Ostrów Lednicki (Poland).

The aetiology of septal aperture formation is still an open question. The 
influence of bone robusticity, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and the size and 
shape of ulnar processes has been discussed. Some researchers have shown that 
weaker muscles lead to greater joint hypermobility, the impingement of ulnar 
processes on the humeral lamina, and, consequently, septal aperture formation. 
Assuming this theory is correct, the question is whether flexion or extension or 
both play a role in septal lamina perforation. The aim of the study was to 
examine the mechanical hypothesis of septal aperture formation in samples of 
skeletal material derived from an early medieval cemetery in Ostrów Lednicki 
(Poland). A total of 136 pairs of bones (humeri and ulnae) were examined. Septal 
aperture was scored as present or absent. Entheseal changes in ulna were used as 
markers of activity patterns, especially involving elbow extension and flexion. 
Entheseal changes were assessed based on a three-point rating scale. A
