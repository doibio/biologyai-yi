The purpose of the study is to determine the nature of the impact of 
antiretroviral therapy on the development of liver fibrosis in patients 
coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
depending on the order of pathogens acquisition. The fact is that the HIV/HCV 
coinfection is one of the most common pathological conditions worldwide and 
liver disease is a major cause of death for these patients. We have previously 
described the phenomenon, according to which the order of viral pathogens 
acquisition in HIV/HCV coinfected patients has a significant impact on the 
degree of progression of liver fibrosis. Introduction to clinical practice of 
antiretroviral therapy greatly increased the life expectancy of HIV-infected 
patients, however, the impact of ART on a progressive course of liver fibrosis 
in HIV/HCV coinfected patients have not yet been definitively established.

Curli are functional amyloids produced by proteobacteria like Escherichia coli 
as part of the extracellular matrix that holds cells together into biofilms. The 
molecular events that occur during curli nucleation and fiber extension remain 
largely unknown. Combining observations from curli amyloidogenesis in bulk 
solutions with real-time in situ nanoscopic imaging at the single-fiber level, 
we show that curli display polar growth, and we detect two kinetic regimes of 
fiber elongation. Single fibers exhibit stop-and-go dynamics characterized by 
bursts of steady-state growth alternated with periods of stagnation. At high 
subunit concentrations, fibers show constant, unperturbed burst growth. Curli 
follow a one-step nucleation process in which monomers contemporaneously fold 
and oligomerize into minimal fiber units that have growth characteristics 
identical to those of the mature fibrils. Kinetic data and interaction studies 
of curli fibrillation in the presence of the natural inhibitor CsgC show that 
the inhibitor binds curli fibers and predominantly acts at the level of fiber 
elongation.

Weight Loss Surgery in Adolescents.

Peoria, Peoria, Illinois, USA.

Childhood obesity continues to be a national health problem, with growing 
numbers of adolescents (8.7%) affected by severe obesity and its associated 
cardiometabolic risks. Since current nonsurgical methods for treating these 
adolescents have only modest effects, weight loss surgery (WLS) is an 
alternative treatment. An overview of the literature was conducted describing 
the selection, management, and outcomes of adolescents undergoing WLS. 
Adolescent guidelines require physical and emotional maturity as well as serious 
comorbidities associated with body mass index cutoffs higher than those used for 
adults. Medium-term to long-term outcomes are similar to those of adults 
undergoing WLS. Such outcomes depend on management by a multidisciplinary team 
with expertise in caring for adolescents who are still developing psychosocially 
and who are relatively more dependent on family supports for continued care. 
Future exploration is needed to elucidate optimal surgical indications for 
adolescents, improved adherence to postoperative care, and the impact of WLS on 
life expectancy. Resulting evidence can better inform the direction for 
healthcare delivery and policy directed toward this at-risk population.

Most mortalities from liver disease and liver cancer worldwide are attributable 
to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus. Despite remarkable advances in 
the treatment of HBV over past decades, limited population-level data are 
available regarding its impact on burden of liver disease and liver cancer. 
Mortality data from liver disease and liver cancer were obtained from the 
national death certificate database of Korea, an HBV-endemic country, between 
1999 and 2013, and were analyzed by Joinpoint analysis. For liver disease, 
number of annual deaths decreased by 62.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
62.0-62.6), crude death rate (CDR) decreased by 64.6% (95% CI, 64.3-64.9) from 
21.2 to 7.5 per 100,000 population, and age-standardized death rate (ADR) 
declined by 75.0% (95% CI, 74.7-75.3), between 1999 and 2013. In contrast, for 
liver cancer, number of annual deaths increased by 17.8% (95% CI, 17.6-18.0) and 
CDR increased by 10.2% (95% CI, 10.0-10.4) from 20.5 to 22.6, although ADR 
decreased by 26.9% (95% CI, 26.6-27.2). The annual number of patients receiving 
oral antiviral agents against HBV increased from 1,716 to 187,226 during the 
study period. The increase in mean age at death from liver disease was 
significantly greater than that from liver cancer (8.8 vs. 6.1 years: P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Marked reduction in liver disease mortality by widespread use of 
antiviral treatments against HBV may increase the life expectancy and number of 
patients at risk of developing liver cancer, inadvertently leading to increased 
burden of liver cancer in an HBV-endemic population. The competing nature 
between death from liver disease and that from liver cancer should be carefully 
considered in establishing a health care policy. (Hepatology 2017;66:1454-1463).

OBJECTIVES: Population-based survival statistics are fundamental to assess the 
efficacy of services offered to improve cancer patients' prognosis. This study 
aims to update cancer survival estimates for the Italian population, as well as 
provide new measures, such as the crude probability of death, which takes into 
account the possibility of dying from causes other than cancer, and the change 
in life expectancy after a cancer diagnosis, to properly address various 
questions.
RESULTS: The study includes 1,932,450 cancer cases detected by the Network of 
Italian Cancer Registries (AIRTUM) from 1994 to 2011 and provides estimates for 
38 cancer sites and for allsites cancer. For most common cancers diagnosed from 
2005 to 2009, age-standardized 5-year net survival was: colon-rectum - males 
65%, females 65%; lung - males 15%, females 19%; breast 87%; prostate 91%. For 
cancer sites such as stomach, colon, rectum, lung, skin melanoma, breast, 
cervix, prostate, and kidney, 5-year net survival is consistent between Central 
and Northern Italy, while it is a few percentage points lower in Southern Italy. 
Funnel plots expose these differences more in detail by showing the survival 
estimates in 13 Italian regions. For all sites but skin, 5- and 10-year net 
survival increased by about 10 percentage points in men and 7 points in women 
from 1994 to 2011.
DISCUSSION: Specific articles deal with results on solid and haematological 
malignancies, international comparisons and analysis of time trends of 
incidence, mortality, and survival in combination for key cancer sites, aiming 
to interpret overall progress in the control of cancer in Italy.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia that 
increases the risk of thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy to prevent 
AF-related stroke has been shown to be cost-effective. A national screening 
programme for AF may prevent AF-related events, but would involve a substantial 
investment of NHS resources.
OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of the diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) 
of screening tests for AF, update a systematic review of comparative studies 
evaluating screening strategies for AF, develop an economic model to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies and review observational 
studies of AF screening to provide inputs to the model.
DESIGN: Systematic review, meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: Primary care.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults.
INTERVENTION: Screening strategies, defined by screening test, age at initial 
and final screens, screening interval and format of screening {systematic 
opportunistic screening [individuals offered screening if they consult with 
their general practitioner (GP)] or systematic population screening (when all 
eligible individuals are invited to screening)}.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios; the 
odds ratio of detecting new AF cases compared with no screening; and the mean 
incremental net benefit compared with no screening.
REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers screened the search results, extracted data and 
assessed the risk of bias. A DTA meta-analysis was perfomed, and a decision tree 
and Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the screening 
strategies.
RESULTS: Diagnostic test accuracy depended on the screening test and how it was 
interpreted. In general, the screening tests identified in our review had high 
sensitivity (> 0.9). Systematic population and systematic opportunistic 
screening strategies were found to be similarly effective, with an estimated 170 
individuals needed to be screened to detect one additional AF case compared with 
no screening. Systematic opportunistic screening was more likely to be 
cost-effective than systematic population screening, as long as the uptake of 
opportunistic screening observed in randomised controlled trials translates to 
practice. Modified blood pressure monitors, photoplethysmography or nurse pulse 
palpation were more likely to be cost-effective than other screening tests. A 
screening strategy with an initial screening age of 65 years and repeated 
screens every 5 years until age 80 years was likely to be cost-effective, 
provided that compliance with treatment does not decline with increasing age.
CONCLUSIONS: A national screening programme for AF is likely to represent a 
cost-effective use of resources. Systematic opportunistic screening is more 
likely to be cost-effective than systematic population screening. Nurse pulse 
palpation or modified blood pressure monitors would be appropriate screening 
tests, with confirmation by diagnostic 12-lead electrocardiography interpreted 
by a trained GP, with referral to a specialist in the case of an unclear 
diagnosis. Implementation strategies to operationalise uptake of systematic 
opportunistic screening in primary care should accompany any screening 
recommendations.
LIMITATIONS: Many inputs for the economic model relied on a single trial [the 
Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in the Elderly (SAFE) study] and DTA results 
were based on a few studies at high risk of bias/of low applicability.
FUTURE WORK: Comparative studies measuring long-term outcomes of screening 
strategies and DTA studies for new, emerging technologies and to replicate the 
results for photoplethysmography and GP interpretation of 12-lead 
electrocardiography in a screening population.

PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess and compare the potential clinical 
and economic value of emerging bone-forming agents using the only currently 
available agent, teriparatide, as a reference case in patients at high, 
near-term (imminent, 1- to 2-year) risk of osteoporotic fractures, extending to 
a lifetime horizon with sequenced antiresorptive agents for maintenance 
treatment.
METHODS: Analyses were performed by using a Markov cohort model accounting for 
time-specific fracture protection effects of bone-forming agents followed by 
antiresorptive treatment with denosumab. The alternative bone-forming agent 
profiles were defined by using assumptions regarding the onset and total 
magnitude of protection against fractures with teriparatide. The model cohort 
comprised 70-year-old female patients with T scores below -2.5 and a previous 
vertebral fracture. Outcomes included clinical fractures, direct costs, and 
quality-adjusted life years. The simulated treatment strategies were compared by 
calculating their incremental "value" (net monetary benefit).
FINDINGS: Improvements in the onset and magnitude of fracture protection (vs the 
teriparatide reference case) produced a net monetary benefit of $17,000,000 per 
10,000 treated patients during the (1.5-year) bone-forming agent treatment 
period and $80,000,000 over a lifetime horizon that included 3.5 years of 
maintenance treatment with denosumab.
IMPLICATIONS: Incorporating time-specific fracture effects in the Markov cohort 
model allowed for estimation of a range of cost savings, quality-adjusted life 
years gained, and clinical fractures avoided at different levels of fracture 
protection onset and magnitude. Results provide a first estimate of the 
potential "value" new bone-forming agents (romosozumab and abaloparatide) may 
confer relative to teriparatide.

BACKGROUND: Pathological fracture of the proximal femur is a main cause of 
cancer patients losing their ability to walk. Although both osteosynthetic 
devices (predominantly intramedullary nails) and prosthetic replacement have 
been widely performed for treatment, controversies exist regarding which 
procedure should be used for the various conditions. In order to decide the 
eligibility criteria of a planned randomized prospective study about the 
treatment of pathological fractures of the proximal femur, we assessed the 
factors affecting the selection of operative procedures using questionnaires 
sent to the members of the Bone and Soft Tissue Tumor Study Group (BSTTSG) of 
the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG).
METHODS: Questionnaire surveys to evaluate (1) the priority levels of the 
factors, (2) the equipoise range of each factor in situations where either 
procedure could be applied, (3) risk and benefit of each procedure, and (4) the 
degree of bone destruction affecting the selection of operative procedures, were 
sent to 26 institutions.
RESULTS: Over 80% of the institutions answered. Orthopaedic surgeons of BSTTSG 
decided on the procedure according to the following factors in descending order: 
life expectancy, performance status before fracture, the degree of bone 
destruction, walking ability before fracture, general complications, the number 
of bone metastases in other sites, and the visceral metastasis status. With 
regard to bone destruction, (1) the involvement of the head, neck, calcar, and 
intertrochanteric region, (2) transverse destruction >1/2, and (3) soft-tissue 
tumor extension, were the factors that led to the choice of prosthesis 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Using these identified factors, the inclusion criteria for the 
prospective randomized study of the surgical treatment of metastatic bone tumors 
of the proximal femur were optimized. The evaluation system about the bone 
destruction of metastases needs to be refined through the following prospective 
randomized study.

A combination of techniques from 3D printing, tissue engineering and 
biomaterials has yielded a new class of engineered biological robots that could 
be reliably controlled via applied signals. These machines are powered by a 
muscle strip composed of differentiated skeletal myofibers in a matrix of 
natural proteins, including fibrin, that provide physical support and cues to 
the cells as an engineered basement membrane. However, maintaining consistent 
results becomes challenging when sustaining a living system in vitro. Skeletal 
muscle must be preserved in a differentiated state and the system is subject to 
degradation by proteolytic enzymes that can break down its mechanical integrity. 
Here we examine the life expectancy, breakdown, and device failure of engineered 
skeletal muscle bio-bots as a result of degradation by three classes of 
proteases: plasmin, cathepsin L, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and 
MMP-9). We also demonstrate the use of gelatin zymography to determine the 
effects of differentiation and inhibitor concentration on protease expression. 
With this knowledge, we are poised to design the next generation of complex 
biological machines with controllable function, specific life expectancy and 
greater consistency. These results could also prove useful for the study of 
disease-specific models, treatments of myopathies, and other tissue engineering 
applications.

Pregnancies and Fetal Anomalies Incompatible with Life in Chile: Arguments and 
Experiences in Advocating for Legal Reform.

Chile allows abortion under no circumstances. Whether it's fetal anomaly 
incompatible with life or congenital malformation resulting in little or no life 
expectancy, all Chilean women are expected to carry their pregnancies to term. 
In this context, in January 2015 the Chilean Congress began debating a bill to 
legalize abortion on three grounds, including fatal congenital malformation. The 
medical community, including midwives, has presented its views for and against, 
especially on how the law may affect clinical practices; in addition, women, 
many of whom have experienced a fatal congenital malformation diagnosis, have 
weighed in. This qualitative study draws on 22 semi-structured interviews with 
nine certified nurse-midwives, one neonatologist, nine 
obstetrician-gynecologists, one psychiatrist, one psychologist, and one 
sociologist who provide care during gestation, pregnancy, delivery, and 
post-delivery in the public and private sectors, plus three interviews with two 
women and the former partner of a woman who underwent the experience. These 
interviews starkly illustrate the plight facing women carrying nonviable 
fetuses, including women's shock upon receiving the diagnosis, their feelings of 
bereavement and loss, and the clinical practices used in an attempt to ease 
their suffering under the weight of exceedingly difficult legal restrictions. 
These interviews confirmed that compelling women to carry nonviable fetuses to 
term violates their human rights. They also show that the chances of legislative 
change are real and that such change will present new challenges to the Chilean 
health care system.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of blinatumomab (Blincyto) vs 
standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy in adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) 
Philadelphia-chromosome-negative (Ph-) B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) based on the results of the phase 3 TOWER study from a US healthcare payer 
perspective.
METHODS: The Blincyto Global Economic Model (B-GEM), a partitioned survival 
model, was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
blinatumomab vs SOC. Response rates, event-free survival (EFS), overall survival 
(OS), numbers of cycles of blinatumomab and SOC, and transplant rates were 
estimated from TOWER. EFS and OS were estimated by fitting parametric survival 
distributions to failure-time data from TOWER. Utility values were based on 
EORTC-8D derived from EORTC QLQ-C30 assessments in TOWER. A 50-year lifetime 
horizon and US payer perspective were employed. Costs and outcomes were 
discounted at 3% per year.
RESULTS: The B-GEM projected blinatumomab to yield 1.92 additional life years 
and 1.64 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with SOC at an 
incremental cost of $180,642. The ICER for blinatumomab vs SOC was estimated to 
be $110,108/QALY gained in the base case. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to 
the number and cost of inpatient days for administration of blinatumomab and 
SOC, and was more favorable in the sub-group of patients who had received no 
prior salvage therapy. At an ICER threshold of $150,000/QALY gained, the 
probability that blinatumomab is cost-effective was estimated to be 74%.
LIMITATIONS: The study does not explicitly consider the impact of adverse events 
of the treatment; no adjustments for long-term transplant rates were made.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with SOC, blinatumomab is a cost-effective treatment 
option for adults with R/R Ph - B-precursor ALL from the US healthcare 
perspective at an ICER threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained. The value of 
blinatumomab is derived from its incremental survival and health-related 
quality-of-life (HRQoL) benefit over SOC.

The purpose of this study was to compare the lower extremity inter-joint 
coordination of different collision forces runners during running braking phase. 
A dynamical system approach was used to analyse the inter-joint coordination 
parameters. Data were collected with six infra-red cameras and two force plates. 
According to the impact peak of the vertical ground reaction force, twenty 
habitually rearfoot-strike runners were categorised into three groups: high 
collision forces runners (HF group, n = 8), medium collision forces runners (MF 
group, n = 5), and low collision forces runners (LF group, n = 7). There were no 
significant differences among the three groups in the ankle and knee joint angle 
upon landing and in the running velocity (p > 0.05). The HF group produced 
significantly smaller deviation phase (DP) of the hip flexion/extension-knee 
flexion/extension during the braking phase compared with the MF and LF groups 
(p < 0.05). The DP of the hip flexion/extension-knee flexion/extension during 
the braking phase correlated negatively with the collision force (p < 0.05). The 
disparities regarding the flexibility of lower extremity inter-joint 
coordination were found in high collision forces runners. The efforts of the 
inter-joint coordination and the risk of running injuries need to be clarified 
further.

Drug hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) are increasing in the 21st Century with 
the ever expanding availability of new therapeutic agents. Patients with cancer, 
chronic inflammatory diseases, cystic fibrosis, or diabetes can become allergic 
to their first line therapy after repeated exposures or through cross reactivity 
with environmental allergens. Avoidance of the offending allergenic drug may 
impact disease management, quality of life, and life expectancy. Precision 
medicine provides new tools for the understanding and management of 
hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), as well as a personalized treatment approach 
for IgE (Immunoglobuline E) and non-IgE mediated HSRs with drug desensitization 
(DS). DS induces a temporary hyporesponsive state by incremental escalation of 
sub-optimal doses of the offending drug. In vitro models have shown evidence 
that IgE desensitization is an antigen-specific process which blocks calcium 
flux, impacts antigen/IgE/FcεRI complex internalization and prevents the acute 
and late phase reactions as well as mast cell mediator release. Through a "bench 
to bedside" approach, in vitro desensitization models help elucidate the 
molecular pathways involved in DS, providing new insights to improved 
desensitization protocols for all patients. The aim of this review is to 
summarize up to date information on the drug HSRs, the IgE mediated mechanisms 
of desensitization, and their clinical applications.

Aurora, Colorado.

CONTEXT: With increasing life expectancy, there is growing demand for 
preservation of native articular cartilage to delay joint arthroplasties, 
especially in younger, active patients. Damage to the hyaline cartilage of a 
joint has a limited intrinsic capacity to heal. This can lead to accelerated 
degeneration of the joint and early-onset osteoarthritis. Treatment in the past 
was limited, however, and surgical treatment options continue to evolve that may 
allow restoration of the natural biology of the articular cartilage. This 
article reviews the most current literature with regard to indications, 
techniques, and outcomes of these restorative procedures.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: MEDLINE and PubMed searches relevant to the topic were 
performed for articles published between 1995 and 2016. Older articles were used 
for historical reference. This paper places emphasis on evidence published 
within the past 5 years.
STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4.
RESULTS: Autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral allografts (OCAs) 
for the treatment of articular cartilage injury allow restoration of hyaline 
cartilage to the joint surface, which is advantageous over options such as 
microfracture, which heal with less favorable fibrocartilage. Studies show that 
these techniques are useful for larger chondral defects where there is no 
alternative. Additionally, meniscal transplantation can be a valuable isolated 
or adjunctive procedure to prolong the health of the articular surface.
CONCLUSION: Newer techniques such as autologous chondrocyte implantation and 
OCAs may safely produce encouraging outcomes in joint preservation.

BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors improve outcomes compared with 
chemotherapy in lung cancer. Tumor PD-L1 receptor expression is being studied as 
a predictive biomarker. The objective of this study was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness and economic impact of second-line treatment with nivolumab, 
pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab with and without the use of PD-L1 testing for 
patient selection.
DESIGN: We developed a decision-analytic model to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of PD-L1 assessment and second-line immunotherapy versus 
docetaxel. The model used outcomes data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) 
and drug acquisition costs from the United States. Thereafter, we used 
epidemiologic data to estimate the economic impact of the treatment.
RESULTS: We included four RCTs (2 with nivolumab, 1 with pembrolizumab, and 1 
with atezolizumab). The incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for 
nivolumab was 0.417 among squamous tumors and 0.287 among non-squamous tumors 
and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were $155 605 and $187 685, 
respectively. The QALY gain in the base case for atezolizumab was 0.354 and the 
ICER was $215 802. Compared with treating all patients, the selection of 
patients by PD-L1 expression improved incremental QALY by up to 183% and 
decreased the ICER by up to 65%. Pembrolizumab was studied only in patients 
whose tumors expressed PD-L1. The QALY gain was 0.346 and the ICER was $98 421. 
Patient selection also reduced the budget impact of immunotherapy.
CONCLUSION: The use of PD-L1 expression as a biomarker increases 
cost-effectiveness of immunotherapy but also diminishes the number of potential 
life-years saved.

BACKGROUND: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed 
life-expectancy and mortality trends among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) 
since 1996. This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the mortality 
epidemiology of PLWHA in Israel and analyze the causes of death.
METHODS: This cohort study included all adult Israeli-citizens PLWHA between 
1985 and 2010 and crossed matched with the Civil Registry to identify those who 
died. Death certificates were classified into AIDS or non-AIDS deaths 
related-causes. Standardized mortality-ratio (SMR) represented mortality excess.
RESULTS: Of all 5140 PLWHA who were followed-up for 36 955 person-years, 1066 
(20.7%) died. The ratio of AIDS-related deaths to non-AIDS related deaths 
reduced from 1.2:1 before 1996 to 0.6:1 after 1997, and case-fatality rates 
reduced from 12.0 to 0.9%, respectively (P < 0.001). SMR were 3.0 (95% CI: 
2.3-3.5) for males and 3.9 (95% CI: 3.3-4.5) for females. Fatality cases were 
more likely older Israeli-born males, co-infected with tuberculosis, reported 
before 1996 and acquired HIV by drug-injection or infected-blood products. 
Deaths of AIDS-related causes were common among Israeli-born gay men, while 
non-AIDS deaths were common among those reported after 1997 and drug users.
CONCLUSIONS: Death rates declined since HAART introduction. Yet, SMR remained 
high, and PLWHA infected by drug-use or blood-products have not enjoyed relative
