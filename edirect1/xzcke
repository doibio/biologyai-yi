life-years (QALYs) gained. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), as 
incremental costs per QALY gained, were calculated using a 3% discount.
RESULTS: As age increased, the number of QALYs gained per patient decreased 
substantially. Surveillance of patients aged 65 years resulted in 2-7 QALYs 
gained, whereas surveillance at age 85 years led to <1 QALY gained. The total 
costs of the surveillance schedules also decreased as age increased. The ICER of 
6-monthly surveillance at age 65 years for lifetime was $4999 (American 
dollars)/QALY gained. Amongst patients aged >75 years, the incremental yield of 
QALY gains for any increase in surveillance frequency and/or duration was quite 
modest (<2 QALYs gained).
CONCLUSION: With increasing age, surveillance for recurrences leads to 
substantially fewer QALYs gained. These data support age-specific surveillance 
recommendations for patients treated for NMIBC.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the compatibility between spirodiclofen and the 
predator Oligota flavicornis is an important aspect for the management of spider 
mites.
RESULTS: We used the age-stage, two-sex life table to assess the effects of 
spirodiclofen on the life history traits and population growth of O. 
flavicornis. At the maximum recommended concentration (60 mg a.i. L-1 ) and also 
at twice the maximum recommended dosage (120 mg a.i. L-1 ), the preadult stages 
of O. flavicornis were significantly lengthened, while the adult longevity and 
fecundity decreased significantly. The finite rate (λ), intrinsic rate of 
increase (r), and net reproduction rate (R0 ) decreased, while the mean 
generation time (T) was longer after both the 60 and 120 mg a.i. L-1 treatments 
than it was in the control and 30 mg a.i. L-1 treatments. Life expectancy and 
reproductive value were higher in the control and 30 mg a.i. L-1 treatment than 
in the 60 and 120 mg a.i. L-1 treatments; the two higher concentrations were 
detrimental to the development of O. flavicornis.
CONCLUSION: A proper combination of the O. flavicornis and spirodiclofen to 
control the spider mite, while avoiding the side effect of spirodiclofen, could 
be achieved based on the knowledge of life tables. © 2018 Society of Chemical

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation of the β-globin gene (Ingram 
VM. Nature 180: 326-328, 1957), which triggers the polymerization of 
deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (HbS). Approximately 100,000 SCD patients in the 
United States and millions worldwide (Piel FB, et al. PLoS Med 10: e1001484, 
2013) suffer from chronic hemolytic anemia, painful crises, multisystem organ 
damage, and reduced life expectancy (Rees DC, et al. Lancet 376: 2018-2031, 
2010; Serjeant GR. Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med 3: a011783, 2013). 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be curative, but the majority of 
patients do not have a suitable donor (Talano JA, Cairo MS. Eur J Haematol 94: 
391-399, 2015). Advanced gene-editing technologies also offer the possibility of 
a cure (Goodman MA, Malik P. Ther Adv Hematol 7: 302-315, 2016; Lettre G, Bauer 
DE. Lancet 387: 2554-2564, 2016), but the likelihood that these strategies can 
be mobilized to treat the large numbers of patients residing in developing 
countries is remote. A pharmacological treatment to increase fetal hemoglobin 
(HbF) as a therapy for SCD has been a long-sought goal, because increased levels 
of HbF (α2γ2) inhibit the polymerization of HbS (Poillin WN, et al. Proc Natl 
Acad Sci USA 90: 5039-5043, 1993; Sunshine HR, et al. J Mol Biol 133: 435-467, 
1979) and are associated with reduced symptoms and increased lifespan of SCD 
patients (Platt OS, et al. N Engl J Med 330: 1639-1644, 1994; Platt OS, et al. N 
Engl J Med 325: 11-16, 1991). Only two drugs, hydroxyurea and l-glutamine, are 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of SCD. 
Hydroxyurea is ineffective at HbF induction in ~50% of patients (Charache S, et 
al. N Engl J Med 332: 1317-1322, 1995). While polymerization of HbS has been 
traditionally considered the driving force in the hemolysis of SCD, the 
excessive reactive oxygen species generated from red blood cells, with further 
amplification by intravascular hemolysis, also are a major contributor to SCD 
pathology. This review highlights a new class of drugs, lysine-specific 
demethylase (LSD1) inhibitors, that induce HbF and reduce reactive oxygen 
species.

There is an ongoing debate whether the life span of successfully treated people 
living with HIV (PLHIV) is comparable with that of the general population. The 
aim of this cohort study is to compare all-cause mortality between all PLHIV, 
successfully treated PLHIV, and HIV-negative control persons from the general 
population and to explore the impact of viral load (VL) at diagnosis. A total of 
4066 PLHIV were matched against 8072 HIV-negative controls according to age, 
sex, and region of birth. Further, associations between VL at diagnosis, time on 
treatment, treatment outcome, and mortality were assessed over a 15-year period. 
Cox regression estimates were computed to compare the overall crude and adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality. After a 15-year follow-up period, 
successfully treated PLHIV were found to be three times more likely to die when 
compared with HIV-negative controls (HR 3.01, 95% CI 2.05-4.44, p < 0.001). The 
risk of mortality decreased from HR 6.02 after the first year of successful 
treatment. VL >30,000 c/mL at diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of 
mortality despite long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment. Although 
effective viral suppression has led to significant increases in longevity and 
quality of life, ART has not fully restored life expectancy to a level 
comparable with that found in HIV-negative persons. Even when PLHIV are 
successfully treated, there are several other important areas related to death, 
such as smoking and social factors, where data are still missing.

Considering their sessile life, plants must efficiently coordinate their 
resources and energy for maintaining their presence in normal living conditions 
and for defending themselves against environmental threats. Collaboration 
between multiple subcellular compartments is a common strategy in several 
biological processes to modify cells' architecture for their growth and 
development and to respond to acute changes in the environment. When plants 
defend themselves against microbial pathogens, chloroplasts generate tubular 
structures - so-called stromules- to facilitate chloroplast movement towards 
nuclei during innate immunity. Morphological changes and movements of stromules 
are directed by interactions with microtubule and actin cytoskeleton. 
Microtubules provide a direction for the stromule extension, while actin 
filaments restrict stromule retraction which provides a driving force for 
repositioning of chloroplast near nucleus during plant immune responses. These 
findings implicated a critical role for stromules in signal transduction from 
chloroplast to the nucleus in plant defense.

BACKGROUND: Cause-specific mortality trends are routinely reported for Scotland. 
However, ill-defined deaths are not routinely redistributed to more precise and 
internationally comparable categories nor is the mortality reported in terms of 
years of life lost to facilitate the calculation of the burden of disease. This 
study describes trends in Years of Life Lost (YLL) for specific causes of death 
in Scotland from 2000 to 2015.
METHODS: We obtained records of all deaths in Scotland by age, sex, area and 
underlying cause of death between 2000 and 2015. We redistributed Ill-Defined 
Deaths (IDDs) to more exact and meaningful causes using internationally accepted 
methods. Years of Life Lost (YLL) using remaining life expectancy by sex and 
single year of age from the 2013 Scottish life table were calculated for each 
death. These data were then used to calculate the crude and age-standardised 
trends in YLL by age, sex, cause, health board area, and area deprivation 
decile.
RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2015, the annual percentage of deaths that were 
ill-defined varied between 10% and 12%. The proportion of deaths that were IDDs 
increased over time and were more common: in women; amongst those aged 1-4 
years, 25-34 years and >80 years; in more deprived areas; and in the island 
health boards. The total YLL fell from around 17,800 years per 100,000 
population in 2000 to around 13,500 years by 2015. The largest individual 
contributors to YLL were Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD), respiratory cancers, 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease and 
Alzheimer's/dementia. The proportion of total YLL due to IHD and stroke declined 
over time, but increased for Alzheimer's/dementia and drug use disorders. There 
were marked absolute inequalities in YLL by area deprivation, with a mean Slope 
Index of Inequality (SII) for all causes of 15,344 YLL between 2001 and 2015, 
with IHD and COPD the greatest contributors. The Relative Index of Inequality 
(RII) for YLL was highest for self-harm and lower respiratory infections.
CONCLUSION: The total YLL per 100,000 population in Scotland has declined over 
time. The YLL in Scotland is predominantly due to a wide range of chronic 
diseases, substance misuse, self-harm and increasingly Alzheimer's disease and 
dementia. Inequalities in YLL, in both relative and absolute terms, are stark.

DNA fingerprinting is a powerful tool for plant diversity studies, cultivar 
identification, and germplasm conservation and management. In breeding programs, 
fingerprinting and diversity analysis provide an insight into the extent of 
genetic variability available in the breeding material, which in turn helps 
breeders to maintain a pool of highly diverse genotypes by avoiding the 
selection of closely related parents. Oblong-long tubers with russeting skin 
characterize Russet potato, a primary potato market class in the United States, 
and especially in the western production regions. The aim of this study was to 
estimate the level of genetic diversity within this market class potato, 
utilizing clones and varieties from various breeding programs across the United 
States. A collection of 264 Russet and non-Russet breeding clones and varieties 
was fingerprinted using 23 highly polymorphic genome-wide simple sequence repeat 
(SSR) markers, resulting in 142 polymorphic alleles. The number of alleles 
produced per SSR varied from 2 to 10, with an average of 6.2 alleles per marker. 
The polymorphic information content and expected heterozygosity of SSRs ranged 
from 0.37 to 0.89 and 0.50 to 0.89 with an average of 0.77 and 0.81, 
respectively. Out of these 23 markers, we propose nine SSR markers best suited 
for fingerprinting Russet potatoes based on polymorphic information content, 
heterozygosity and ease of scoring. Diversity analysis of these clones suggest 
that there is significant diversity across the breeding material and the 
diversity has been evenly distributed among all the regional breeding programs.

INTRODUCTION Physical activity is beneficial for the physical and psychological 
health of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Health-care practitioners are 
ideally positioned to promote physical activity to their patients. AIM To 
identify factors that influenced health care practitioners to either promote or 
not promote physical activity to their patients with PCa. METHODS Individual 
interviews were conducted with 16 Auckland-based health-care practitioners, 
including specialists (oncologists and urologists), physiotherapists and 
complementary and alternative (acupuncturists) health-care practitioners. Data 
were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS Treatment-related 
factors (ie counteracting side-effects of hormone suppression treatment), longer 
life expectancy and risk factors for other conditions appeared to influence the 
promotion of physical activity to patients. Time constraints of consultations 
and complex medical issues were barriers to the promotion of physical activity. 
CONCLUSIONS This study found that a variety of health-care practitioners are 
providing some degree of physical activity advice to their patients with PCa. 
Collaborative practice among health-care practitioners to verbally reinforce the 
benefits of physical activity, coupled with referral to experts in physical 
activity promotion/rehabilitation (such as physiotherapists), should be 
encouraged for best practice care.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse average lifespan and quantify the effect of 
avoidable/amenable mortality on the difference between state-specific mortality 
and a low-mortality benchmark in Mexico during 1990-2015.
DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional demographic analysis using aggregated 
data.
SETTING: Vital statistics from the Mexican civil registration system.
PARTICIPANTS: Aggregated national data (from 91.2 million people in 1995 to 
119.9 in 2015) grouped in 64 populations (32 Mexican states (including Mexico 
City) by sex) with cause-of-death data.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cause-specific contributions to the gap in life 
expectancy with a low-mortality benchmark in three age groups (0-14, 15-49 and 
50-84 years).
RESULTS: Infants and children under the age of 15 years show improvements 
towards maximal survival in all states. However, adult males aged 15 to 49 years 
show deterioration after 2006 in almost every state due to increasing homicides, 
and a slow recovery thereafter. Out of 35 potential years, females and males 
live on average 34.57 (34.48 to 34.67) and 33.80 (33.34 to 34.27), respectively. 
Adults aged 50 to 84 years show an unexpected decrease in the low mortality 
benchmark, indicating nationwide deterioration among older adults. Females and 
males in this age group show an average survival of 28.59 (27.43 to 29.75) and 
26.52 (25.33 to 27.73) out of 35 potential years, respectively. State gaps from 
the benchmark were mainly caused by ischaemic heart diseases, diabetes, 
cirrhosis and homicides. We find large health disparities between states, 
particularly for the adult population after 2005.
CONCLUSIONS: Mexico has succeeded in reducing mortality and between-state 
inequalities in children. However, adults are becoming vulnerable as they have 
not been able to reduce the burden of violence and conditions amenable to health 
services and behaviours, such as diabetes, ischaemic heart diseases and 
cirrhosis. These trends have led to large health disparities between Mexican 
states in the last 25 years.

BACKGROUND: Along with the increase of the health and prosperity level will 
affect the life expectancy in Indonesia, there has also been an increase in 
degenerative disease cases. One of the problems arises is cognitive impairment. 
The mild version of this impairment is often associated with the increase risk 
that will eventually lead to dementia. Therefore, early detection of this 
impairment is necessary.
OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at proving the correlation between Fazekas scale 
on brain MRI and MoCA-Ina score in defining the degree of cognitive impairment.
METHODS: This study employed observational analytic design and cross sectional 
study for its data collection method. The Fazekas scale on brain MRI of 32 
patients was read by 3 radiologist, while the MoCA-Ina scoring was done by a 
competent neurologist. Both tests were done double blindly. Later on, the 
correlation between Fazekas scale and MoCA-Ina score would be assessed using 
Spearman Correlation.
RESULTS: Statistical calculation conducted using Spearman Correlation reveals 
that the coefficient is -0.519 with significant score (P) 0.002, which is 
smaller than α: 0.05. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a strong 
negative correlation between Fazekas scale and MoCA-Ina score.
CONCLUSION: Fazekas scale evaluation on brain MRI is necessary to be performed 
as it helps predicting the decline of one's cognitive function, so that an early 
therapy can be acted upon to prevent dementia in the future.

BACKGROUND: Injury is a major public health problem and accounts for 10% of the 
global burden of disease. This study intends to present the temporal trend in 
the injury burden in Korea and to compare the burden size by injury mechanism 
and age group.
METHODS: This study was a nationwide population-based observational study. We 
used two data sets, the death certificates statistics and the Korean National 
Hospital Discharge Survey data (2004-2012). We calculated age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) from years of life lost (YLL) and years 
lived with disability (YLD) and trend analysis.
RESULTS: The DALYs of road injury decreased (P = 0.002), falls did not exhibit a 
trend (P = 0.108), and self-harm increased overall (P = 0.045). In the road 
injury, the YLLs decreased across all 4 age groups (0-14, 15-49, 50-79, ≥ 80) 
and the YLDs decreased in the 0-14-year-old group. In total, the DALYs of road 
injuries decreased in the 0-14-year-old group. In the fall injury, although the 
YLLs decreased in the over 80-year-old group, the YLDs increased in the 
50-79-year-old group and the over 80-year-old group. The burden of self-harm 
injury was high in the age group 15 years and over, especially in the 
15-49-year-old group.
CONCLUSION: The leading causes of the injury burden were road injuries, falls, 
and self-harm. The burden of road injury and self-harm have recently shown a 
gradual decreasing tendency. On the other hands, that of fall injuries are 
continually high in the age group over 50 years of age.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to estimate the burden of acute pesticide poisoning 
and to determine its trend with recently implemented pesticide regulations.
METHODS: Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of 
years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) due to acute 
pesticide poisoning using the methods of the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2013. The values of YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were stratified by sex, age groups, 
intentionality of poisoning, and causative agents.
RESULTS: From 2006 to 2014, DALYs decreased by 69% (from 69,550 to 21,742). The 
decreasing tendency of DALYs was especially marked from 2011. The total burden 
of acute pesticide poisoning was mainly caused by YLLs and intentional pesticide 
poisoning. The highest DALYs due to acute pesticide poisoning occurred in those 
in their 40s and 50s; however, the decreased rates of DALYs were higher in those 
aged 10-49 years than in those aged more than 50 years. Herbicides including 
paraquat contributed to the largest proportion of total DALYs.
CONCLUSION: As this is the first study to quantify the burden of acute pesticide 
poisoning using DALYs, our results provide comprehensive evidence of the 
importance of using strict regulations to prevent public health hazards due to 
acute pesticide poisoning.

INTRODUCTION: Patients over 75 years of age, who, in addition, often have 
already exceeded the average life expectancy, in the Polish population on 
average 77.4 years, are the subject of discussion concerning the most 
appropriate choice of treatment.
AIM: To analyse the long-term results in elderly patients over 75 years of age 
with lung cancer who underwent curative pulmonary resection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 166 patients aged from 75 to 85 (mean: 77.4 ±2.3) operated 
on for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were included in this study. There 
were 128 (77%) men and 38 (23%) women.
RESULTS: Lobectomy, including bilobectomy, was performed in 122 (74%) patients, 
pneumonectomy in 8 (5%) patients, and wedge resections or segmentectomy in the 
remaining 36 patients. Squamous or adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 46% and 42% 
of cases respectively. Clinical stage I A was diagnosed in 36 (22%) patients, I 
B in 51 (31%), IIA in 30 (18%), IIB in 19 (11%) and IIIA in 30 (18%) of our 
cases. The early 30-day postoperative mortality was 5% whilst postoperative 
morbidity occurred in 47% of cases. The five-year survival rate was 30%. In 
statistical analysis, the TNM classification (p = 0.0490), the number of 
postoperative complications (p = 0.0001) and obstructive atelectasis requiring 
repeat bronchofibroscopic aspirations (p = 0.0137) in the early postoperative 
period most negatively influenced the long-term survival in the whole study 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resections for lung cancer in patients over 75 years of 
age are characterised by a relatively good long-term prognosis. Careful and 
strictly detailed preoperative selection, particularly of patients with 
pulmonary comorbidities and the earliest possible diagnosis of a lung tumour, 
can reduce the occurrence of these postoperative complications in elderly 
patients, which negatively influence long-term results.

Publisher: WSTĘP: Najwłaściwszy sposób leczenia raka płuca i możliwości 
radykalnego leczenia operacyjnego u najstarszych pacjentów, powyżej 75. roku 
życia, często w wieku przekraczającym średni czas przeżycia w populacji Polski 
(77,4 roku), stanowią podmiot dyskusji.
CEL: Ocena odległych wyników radykalnego leczenia operacyjnego u chorych powyżej 
75. roku życia z niedrobnokomórkowym rakiem płuca (NDRP).
MATERIAŁ I METODY: Do badania włączono 166 chorych w wieku od 75 do 85 lat 
(średnia 77,4 ±2,3 roku), operowanych z powodu NDRP. Wśród nich było 128 (77%) 
mężczyzn i 38 (23%) kobiet.
WYNIKI: U 122 (74%) chorych wykonano lobektomię lub bilobektomię, u 8 (5%) 
pneumonektomię, natomiast u pozostałych 36 (21%) chorych – resekcję klinową lub 
segmentektomię. Najczęściej u badanych rozpoznawano raka płaskonabłonkowego 
(47%) oraz gruczolakoraka (42%). Stopień kliniczny I A stwierdzono u 36 (22%) 
chorych, I B u 51 (31%), II A u 30 (18%), II B u 19 (11%), a III A u pozostałych 
30 (18%) chorych. Wczesna, 30-dniowa śmiertelność pooperacyjna wyniosła 5%. 
Powikłania we wczesnym okresie pooperacyjnym wystąpiły u 47% badanych. 
Pięcioletnie przeżycie po operacji uzyskano u 30% badanych. W analizie 
statystycznej wykazano, że stopień zaawansowania nowotworu (p = 0,049), liczba 
powikłań pooperacyjnych (p = 0,0001) oraz pooperacyjna niedodma wymagająca 
powtarzalnych bronchofiberoskopii (p = 0,0137) miały najistotniejszy negatywny 
wpływ na przeżycie odległe wśród chorych.
WNIOSKI: Resekcje płucne u chorych powyżej 75. roku życia pozwalają uzyskać 
satysfakcjonujące wyniki pod względem odległego przeżycia pod warunkiem 
ostrożnej i wnikliwej przedoperacyjnej selekcji pacjentów, zwłaszcza tych, 
którzy są obciążeni chorobami współistniejącymi, oraz wczesnego rozpoznania 
choroby. Może to zmniejszyć częstość występowania tych powikłań pooperacyjnych, 
które negatywnie wpływają na przeżycia odległe.

The gastronomy and the Omic sciences are having a great influence on the present 
and the future of the habitual food intake of the population. A very large 
percentage of the population makes at least one meal outside the home and this 
food impact is maintained over an extended period of time. Food production, food 
industry and food distribution (including hotels and restaurants, HORECA 
channel) have a great importance in the supply of food and beverages, its 
composition and suitability in quantity, quality and price. Based on this 
availability of food, the consumer will make-up the shopping basket and will 
choose foods in many cases considering price, comfort, sensory perception and 
even for its potential impact on health. Omic sciences can be of great 
importance in the near future by specifying the configuration of the precision 
feed and stimulating the investigation of new foods and components that help 
contribute to better health, better functionality and longer life expectancy 
without disability. This whole panorama needs a legislative framework that 
ensures the precautionary principle and an optimal food safety. In this 
complicated way the collaboration between science, industry, consumer 
organizations and the administration must facilitate the objective of making 
food a tool for promoting health and well-being.

periodo prolongado de tiempo. La producción y la distribución de alimentos, así 
como la industria alimentaria (incluidos la hostelería y la restauración: el 
canal horeca), tienen una gran trascendencia en la oferta de alimentos y bebidas 
y en su composición e idoneidad en cantidad, calidad y precio. Sobre esta 
disponibilidad de alimentos el consumidor configurará su cesta de la compra y la 
elección de alimentos, en muchos casos por precio, comodidad, percepción 
sensorial e incluso por su impacto potencial en la salud.Las ciencias ómicas 
pueden tener una gran trascendencia en un futuro cercano, concretando la

nuevos alimentos y componentes que posibiliten un mejor estado de salud, una 
mejor funcionalidad y una mayor esperanza de vida sin discapacidad. Todo este 
panorama necesita un marco legislativo que asegure el principio de precaución y

The objective of this review is to summarize the most relevant aspects of the 
attention to diners with specific diet in the catering sector. The 
characteristics of the final consumer usually determine both the variety of 
specific diets to be served and the operative of the service. There are two 
models of catering services that are differentiated from each other by the place 
where the foods are prepared and delivered: centralized production and on-site 
production. The specialized work of Dieticians and the implementation of 
technological solutions that entail the optimization and a better control of the 
process are usual in the catering sector. The management of specifics diets in 
catering sector is intrinsic to its activity. Despite the high professionalism 
of the sector in this area, it is necessary a constant adaptation to the new 
emerging needs, especially those related to allergies and food intolerances and 
the situations of dependence generated by the increase of the life expectancy of 
the population.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-shortening condition caused by 
mutation in the gene that codes for that codes for the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which functions as a salt 
transporter. F508del, the most common CFTR mutation that causes CF, is found in 
up to 80% to 90% of people with CF. In people with this mutation, a full length 
of protein is transcribed, but recognised as misfolded by the cell and degraded 
before reaching the cell membrane, where it needs to be positioned to effect 
transepithelial salt transport. This severe mutation is associated with no 
meaningful CFTR function. A corrective therapy for this mutation could 
positively impact on an important proportion of the CF population.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of CFTR correctors on clinically important 
outcomes, both benefits and harms, in children and adults with CF and class II 
CFTR mutations (most commonly F508del).
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register. We also searched reference lists of relevant 
articles and online trials registries. Most recent search: 24 February 2018.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel design) 
comparing CFTR correctors to placebo in people with CF with class II mutations. 
We also included RCTs comparing CFTR correctors combined with CFTR potentiators 
to placebo.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data, assessed 
risk of bias and quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Study authors 
were contacted for additional data.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 RCTs (2215 participants), lasting between 1 day and 
24 weeks. Additional safety data from an extension study of two 
lumacaftor-ivacaftor studies were available at 96 weeks (1029 participants). We 
assessed monotherapy in seven RCTs (317 participants) (4PBA (also known as 
Buphenyl), CPX, lumacaftor or cavosonstat) and combination therapy in six RCTs 
(1898 participants) (lumacaftor-ivacaftor or tezacaftor-ivacaftor) compared to 
placebo. Twelve RCTs recruited individuals homozygous for F508del, one RCT 
recruited participants with one F508del mutation and a second mutation with 
residual function.Risk of bias varied in its impact on the confidence we have in 
our results across different comparisons. Some findings were based on single 
RCTs that were too small to show important effects. For five RCTs, results may 
not be applicable to all individuals with CF due to age limits of recruited 
populations (i.e. adults only, children only) or non-standard design of 
converting from monotherapy to combination therapy.Monotherapy versus placeboNo 
deaths were reported and there were no clinically relevant improvements in 
quality of life in any RCT. There was insufficient evidence available from 
individual studies to determine the effect of any of the correctors examined on 
lung function outcomes.No placebo-controlled study of monotherapy demonstrated a 
difference in mild, moderate or severe adverse effects; however, it is difficult 
to assess the clinical relevance of these events with the variety of events and 
the small number of participants.Combination therapy versus placeboNo deaths 
were reported during any RCT (moderate- to high-quality evidence). The quality 
of life scores (respiratory domain) favoured combination therapy (both 
lumacaftor-ivacaftor and tezacaftor-ivacaftor) compared to placebo at all time 
points. At six months lumacaftor (600 mg once daily or 400 mg once daily) plus 
ivacaftor improved Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ) scores by a small amount 
compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 2.62 points (95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.64 to 4.59); 1061 participants; high-quality evidence). A similar effect 
size was observed for twice-daily lumacaftor (200 mg) plus ivacaftor (250 mg) 
although the quality of evidence was low (MD 2.50 points (95% CI 0.10 to 5.10)). 
The mean increase in CFQ scores with twice-daily tezacaftor (100 mg) and 
ivacaftor (150 mg) was approximately five points (95% CI 3.20 to 7.00; 504 
participants; moderate-quality evidence). Lung function measured by relative 
change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted improved 
with both combination therapies compared to placebo at six months, by 5.21% with 
once daily lumacaftor-ivacaftor (95% CI 3.61% to 6.80%; 504 participants; 
high-quality evidence) and by 2.40% with twice-daily lumacaftor-ivacaftor (95% 
CI 0.40% to 4.40%; 204 participants; low-quality evidence). One study reported 
an increase in FEV1 with tezacaftor-ivacaftor of 6.80% (95% CI 5.30 to 8.30%; 
520 participants; moderate-quality evidence).More participants receiving the 
lumacaftor-ivacaftor combination reported early transient breathlessness, odds 
ratio 2.05 (99% CI 1.10 to 3.83; 739 participants; high-quality evidence). In 
addition, participants allocated to the 400 mg twice-daily dose of 
lumacaftor-ivacaftor experienced a rise in blood pressure over the 120-week 
period of the initial studies and the follow-up study of 5.1 mmHg (systolic 
blood pressure) and 4.1 mmHg (diastolic blood pressure) (80 participants; 
high-quality evidence). These adverse effects were not reported in the 
tezacaftor-ivacaftor studies.The rate of pulmonary exacerbations decreased for 
participants receiving and additional therapies to ivacaftor compared to 
placebo: lumacaftor 600 mg hazard ratio (HR) 0.70 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.87; 739 
participants); lumacaftor 400 mg, HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.76; 740 
participants); and tezacaftor, HR 0.64 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.89; 506 participants) 
(moderate-quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence that monotherapy with 
correctors has clinically important effects in people with CF who have two 
copies of the F508del mutation.Combination therapies (lumacaftor-ivacaftor and 
tezacaftor-ivacaftor) each result in similarly small improvements in clinical 
outcomes in people with CF; specifically improvements quality of life 
(moderate-quality evidence), in respiratory function (high-quality evidence) and 
lower pulmonary exacerbation rates (moderate-quality evidence). 
Lumacaftor-ivacaftor is associated with an increase in early transient shortness 
of breath and longer-term increases in blood pressure (high-quality evidence). 
These adverse effects were not observed for tezacaftor-ivacaftor. 
Tezacaftor-ivacaftor has a better safety profile, although data are not 
available for children younger than 12 years. In this age group, 
lumacaftor-ivacaftor had an important impact on respiratory function with no 
apparent immediate safety concerns, but this should be balanced against the 
increase in blood pressure and shortness of breath seen in longer-term data in 
adults when considering this combination for use in young people with CF.

Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis-Attributable Years of Potential Life Lost to Life 
Expectancy and Potential Life Lost Before Age 65 Years - United States, 
1999-2016.

Health, CDC.

Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) is a preventable occupational lung disease 
caused by inhaling coal mine dust that can lead to premature* death (1,2). To 
assess trends in premature mortality attributed to CWP (3), CDC analyzed 
underlying† causes of death data from 1999 to 2016, the most recent years for 
which complete data are available. Years of potential life lost to life 
expectancy (YPLL) and years of potential life lost before age 65 years (YPLL65)§ 
were calculated (4). During 1999-2016, a total of 38,358 YPLL (mean per 
decedent = 8.8 years) and 2,707 YPLL65 (mean per decedent = 7.3 years) were 
attributed to CWP. The CWP-attributable YPLL decreased from 3,300 in 1999 to 
1,813 in 2007 (p<0.05). No significant change in YPLL occurred after 2007. 
During 1996-2016, however, the mean YPLL per decedent significantly increased 
from 8.1 to 12.6 per decedent (p<0.001). Overall, CWP-attributable YPLL65 did 
not change. The mean YPLL65 per decedent decreased from 6.5 in 1999 to 4.3 in 
2002 (p<0.05), sharply increased to 8.9 in 2005, and then gradually decreased to 
6.5 in 2016 (p<0.001). Increases in YPLL per decedent during 1999-2016 indicate 
that over time decedents aged ≥25 years with CWP lost more years of life 
relative to their life expectancies, suggesting increased CWP severity and rapid 
disease progression. This finding underscores the need for strengthening proven 
prevention measures to prevent premature CWP-associated mortality.

BACKGROUND: Although average life-expectancy is still increasing worldwide, 
ageing processes markedly differ between individuals, which has stimulated the 
search for biomarkers of biological ageing.
OBJECTIVES: Firstly, to explore the cross-sectional and longitudinal association 
between leucocyte telomere length (LTL) as molecular marker of ageing and the 
physical frailty phenotype (PFP) as a clinical marker of ageing and secondly, to 
examine whether these associations are moderated by the presence of a depressive 
disorder, as depression can be considered a condition of accelerated ageing.
METHODS: Among 378 depressed older patients (according to DSM-IV criteria) and 
132 non-depressed older persons participating in the Netherlands Study of 
Depression in Older persons, we have assessed the physical frailty phenotype and 
LTL. The PFP was defined according to Fried's criteria and its components were 
reassessed at two-year follow-up.
RESULTS: LTL was neither associated with the PFP at baseline by Spearman rank 
correlation tests, nor did it predict change in frailty parameters over a 
two-year follow-up using regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders.
CONCLUSION: LTL is not associated with frailty; neither in non-depressed nor in 
depressed older persons. As LTL and physical frailty appear to represent 
different aspects of ageing, they may complement each other in future studies.

Automobile proving ground is important for the research of vehicles which are 
used for vehicle dynamics, durability testing, braking testing, etc. However, 
the road in automobile proving grounds will inevitably be damaged with the 
extension of the service life. In most previous research, equipment similar to a 
laser profilometer was used to detect the quality of the road, the principle of 
which is to reflect the quality of the road by measuring the roughness of the 
pavement. This method ignores the elastic deformation of the road itself when 
the vehicle is traveling and it is difficult to compensate for the error.
