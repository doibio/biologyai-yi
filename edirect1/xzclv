dominate future production across Africa. Land use models project an expansion 
of harvest area, whereas crop models project possible yield increases. Moreover, 
a seed change in farming strategy is underway. This is being driven largely by 
the combined cash crop value of products such as oils and the high nutritional 
benefits of soybean as an animal feed. Intensification of soybean production has 
the potential to reduce the dependence of Africa on soybean imports. However, a 
successful "soybean bonanza" across Africa necessitates an intensive research, 
development, extension, and policy agenda to ensure that soybean genetic 
improvements and production technology meet future demands for sustainable 
production.

University, Delhi, India.

This paper re-examines health-growth relationship using an unbalanced panel of 
17 advanced economies for the period 1870-2013 and employs panel generalised 
method of moments estimator that takes care of endogeneity issues, which arise 
due to reverse causality. We utilise macroeconomic data corresponding to 
inflation, government expenditure, trade and schooling in sample countries that 
takes care of omitted variable bias in growth regression. With alternate model 
specifications, we show that population health proxied by life expectancy exert 
a positive and significant effect on both real income per capita as well as 
growth. Our results are in conformity with the existing empirical evidence on 
the relationship between health and economic growth, they, however, are more 
robust due to the presence of long-term data, appropriate econometric procedure 
and alternate model specifications. We also show a strong role of endogeneity in 
driving standard results in growth empirics. In addition to life expectancy, 
other constituent of human capital, education proxied by schooling is also 
positively associated with real per capita income. Policy implication that 
follows from this paper is that per capita income can be boosted through 
focussed policy attention on population health. The results, however, posit 
differing policy implications for advanced and developing economies.

and India.

Availability and consumption of eggs, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, 
is low despite their apparent benefits. We investigated constraints in egg 
production in four countries; Kenya, Ethiopia, Malawi, and India and identified 
five business models that are viable and sustainable. They are (a) 
micro-franchising, (b) microfinancing, (c) co-operative farming, (d) enterprise 
development, and (e) out-grower model. All of them involve smallholder farmers 
to increase egg production. These farmers have access to soft loans and use 
improved inputs and extension services to varying degrees. Inputs include 
resilient breeds of day-old chicks or point-of-lay hens, feed, vaccines, 
medicines, and housing. Outgrower and enterprise development models have a 
significant potential of rapidly increasing egg yields, achieve 
self-sufficiency, operate at or near scale, and provide a high income for the 
farmers. This study shows how a range of actors in commercial, not-for-profit 
and microfinance sectors with specialized skills, can facilitate the 
transformation of the egg production sector. Specific skills include brooding 
(hatchery operations), feed milling, aggregation, and training of smallholder 
farmers or large-scale rearing. The five archetypes we describe here are 
promising ways to increase egg availability in rural areas.

Caregiving, Employment and Social Isolation: Challenges for Rural Carers in 
Australia.

Australia has one of the world's highest life expectancy rates, and there is a 
rapidly growing need for informal caregivers to support individuals who are 
ageing, have chronic illness or a lifelong disability. These informal carers 
themselves face numerous physical and psychological stressors in attempting to 
balance the provision of care with their personal life, their work commitments 
and family responsibilities. However, little is known about the specific 
challenges facing rural carers and the barriers that limit their capacity to 
provide ongoing support. A cross-sectional survey composed of open-ended 
responses and demographic/socioeconomic measures used routinely by the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Australian Institute of Health 
&amp; Welfare (AIHW) was used with a cohort of 225 rurally-based carers within 
New South Wales, Australia. Demographic questions specified the respondents' 
age, gender, employment, caregiving status, condition of and relationship to the 
care recipient, postcode, residency status, and distance and frequency travelled 
to provide care. Open-ended comments sections were provided to allow 
participants to describe any issues and problems associated with caregiving 
including employment, travel, residency, carer support groups and any other 
general information. The results show that most rural carers were middle-aged 
women supporting a spouse or a child. Unpredictability associated with providing 
care exacerbated demands on carers' time, with many reporting significant 
employment consequences associated with inflexibility and limited job options in 
rural locations. Specific issues associated with travel requirements to assist 
with care were reported, as were the impacts of care provision on the 
respondents' own personal health. The majority of carers were aware of the 
social supports available in their local rural community, but did not access 
them, leaving the carers vulnerable to marginalisation. Problems associated with 
employment were noted as resulting in financial pressures and associated 
personal stress and anxiety for the caregivers. While this issue is not 
necessarily limited to rural areas, it would appear that the lack of opportunity 
and flexibility evident in rural areas would exacerbate this problem for 
non-metropolitan residents. The participants also identified specific barriers 
to the provision of care in rural areas, including the significant impact of 
travel. Access to support services, such as carer groups, were rarely accessed 
due to a mix of factors including inaccessibility, poor timing and a lack of 
anonymity. Financially, there was considerable evidence of hardship, and there 
is an urgent need for a comprehensive review of government and community-based 
support to better meet the needs of rural carers.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the natural history and treatment effect on survival among 
patients with transthyretin-associated familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) 
stage 1 Val30Met.
METHODS: Multi-institutional, hospital-based study of patients with TTR-FAP 
Val30Met prospectively followed up until December 2016, grouped into untreated 
(n = 1,771), liver transplant (LTx)-treated (n = 957), or tafamidis-treated (n = 
432) cohorts. Standardized mortality ratios, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox methods were 
used to estimate excess mortality, survival, and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) 
for all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Disease-modifying treatments decreased TTR-FAP excess mortality from 10 
to 4 (standardized mortality ratio 3.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
2.64-5.59). Median overall survival of untreated and LTx-treated cohorts was 
11.61 (95% CI 11.14-11.87) and 24.73 years (95% CI 22.90-27.09), respectively, 
and was not reached in the tafamidis-treated cohort (maximum follow-up, 10 
years). Both disease-modifying treatments improved survival. Among early-onset 
patients (younger than 50 years of age), tafamidis reduced the mortality risk 
compared with untreated patients by 91% (HR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.25, p < 0.001) 
and with LTx-treated patients by 63% (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-1.00, p = 0.050). 
Previous tafamidis treatment did not affect mortality risk after LTx (HR 0.83, 
95% CI 0.25-2.78, p = 0.763). Among late-onset patients (50 years and older), 
tafamidis reduced mortality risk by 82% compared with untreated patients (HR 
0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.49, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: LTx and tafamidis convey substantial survival benefits, but TTR-FAP 
mortality remains higher than in the general population. These results strongly 
reinforce the importance of timely diagnosis and earlier treatment, boosting the 
pursuit for an increased life expectancy.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that for 
patients with stage 1 Val30Met TTR-FAP, LTx and tafamidis increase survival.

Climate change is affecting both the environment and human behaviour. One 
significant impact is related to health, as detailed in the IPCC 2014 report. In 
the present work, and as a contribution to this commemorative special issue to 
Prof. Dr Jan van der Leun, we present the results of the squamous (SCC) and 
basal-cell carcinoma (BCC) incidence change in relation to the ambient 
temperature increase. This increase is produced by global warming, mainly 
induced by anthropogenic atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases. We have 
broadened a previous study conducted by van der Leun et al. (Photochem. 
Photobiol. Sci., 2008, 7, 730-733), by analysing the effective carcinogenicity 
of UV dose, for the period 2000-2200 and four climate change scenarios (called 
RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5). The corresponding percentage increases of 
the incidence of SCC for 2100 are 5.8, 10.4, 13.8 and 21.4%, and for 2200 they 
are 4.3, 12.1, 19.0 and 40.5%. In a similar way, the percentage increases of the 
incidence of BCC for 2100 are 2.8, 4.9, 6.5 and 9.9% and for 2200 they are 2.0, 
5.8, 8.9 and 18.2%. We report the SCC and BCC percentage effective incidence 
results as a function of time, for the whole 21st century and we extended the 
analysis to the 22nd century, since people possibly affected (like the Z and T 
generations, born at the beginning of this century) will have a life expectancy 
extending up to the final decades of the present century and even to the first 
ones of the next century.

Following the elucidation of the human genome, chemogenomics emerged in the 
beginning of the twenty-first century as an interdisciplinary research field 
with the aim to accelerate target and drug discovery by making best usage of the 
genomic data and the data linkable to it. What started as a systematization 
approach within protein target families now encompasses all types of chemical 
compounds and gene products. A key objective of chemogenomics is the 
establishment, extension, analysis, and prediction of a comprehensive SAR matrix 
which by application will enable further systematization in drug discovery. 
Herein we outline future perspectives of chemogenomics including the extension 
to new molecular modalities, or the potential extension beyond the pharma to the 
agro and nutrition sectors, and the importance for environmental protection. The 
focus is on computational sciences with potential applications for compound 
library design, virtual screening, hit assessment, analysis of phenotypic 
screens, lead finding and optimization, and systems biology-based prediction of 
toxicology and translational research.

The identification of conserved genes and pathways that regulate lifespan but 
also healthspan has resulted in an improved understanding of the link between 
nutrients, signal transduction proteins, and aging but has also provided 
evidence for the existence of multiple "longevity programs," which are selected 
based on the availability of nutrients. Periodic fasting and other dietary 
restrictions can promote entry into a long-lasting longevity program 
characterized by cellular protection and optimal function but can also activate 
regenerative processes that lead to rejuvenation, which are independent of the 
aging rate preceding the restricted period. Thus, a "juventology"-based strategy 
can complement the traditional gerontology approach by focusing not on aging but 
on the longevity program affecting the life history period in which mortality is 
very low and organisms remain youthful, healthy, and fully functional.

Due to the progressive increase in life expectancy, the number of elderly people 
in the world is growing rapidly. Although there are no liver diseases specific 
of older age, the ageing liver shows some anatomical and physiological changes 
that can affect the frequency and the clinical behavior of most hepatopathies. 
In particular, these changes tend to cause an increased vulnerability to acute 
liver injury and an increased susceptibility to liver fibrosis, accounting for 
the predisposition to a generally more severe course of liver diseases compared 
to younger patients. Furthermore, advanced age is also associated with immune 
system alterations, influencing the manifestation of those hepatopathies that 
are mediated by host immune response, like viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis 
but also hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite these changes, total liver function 
and laboratory values tend to be well maintained in healthy elderly, so that 
every enzymatic alteration in a geriatric patient should be investigated with 
the same attention as in a younger one. A proper and early diagnosis is of great 
importance both considering the age-related more aggressive course of 
hepatopathies and that age itself does not seem to be a limit for most treatment 
options, even if specific data are often lacking. This paper focuses on the 
peculiarities of main liver diseases in geriatrics, with respect to 
epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management, which can be more 
challenging in advanced age because of the frequent comorbidities and 
polytherapies.

BACKGROUND: Despite a recent decline in the annual incidence of tuberculosis 
(TB) in the UK, rates remain higher than in most Western European countries. The 
detection and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) is an essential component 
of the UK TB control programme.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the prognostic value and cost-effectiveness of the current 
two interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) compared with the standard 
tuberculin skin test (TST) for predicting active TB among untreated individuals 
at increased risk of TB: (1) contacts of active TB cases and (2) new entrants to 
the UK from high-TB-burden countries.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study and economic analysis.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were recruited in TB clinics, general 
practices and community settings. Contacts of active TB cases and migrants who 
were born in high-TB-burden countries arriving in the UK were eligible to take 
part if they were aged ≥ 16 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes include incidence rate ratios comparing the 
incidence of active TB in those participants with a positive test result and 
those with a negative test result for each assay, and combination of tests and 
the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for each screening strategy.
RESULTS: A total of 10,045 participants were recruited between May 2010 and July 
2015. Among 9610 evaluable participants, 97 (1.0%) developed active TB. For the 
primary analysis, all test data were available for 6380 participants, with 77 
participants developing active TB. A positive result for TSTa (positive if 
induration is ≥ 5 mm) was a significantly poorer predictor of progression to 
active TB than a positive result for any of the other tests. Compared with TSTb 
[positive if induration is ≥ 6 mm without prior bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) 
alone, T-SPOT®.TB (Oxford Immunotec Ltd, Oxford, UK), TSTa + T-SPOT.TB, 
TSTa + IGRA and the three combination strategies including TSTb were 
significantly superior predictors of progression. Compared with the T-SPOT.TB 
test alone, TSTa + T-SPOT.TB, TSTb + QuantiFERON® TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT; 
QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and TSTb + IGRA were significantly superior 
predictors of progression and, compared with QFT-GIT alone, T-SPOT.TB, 
TSTa + T-SPOT.TB, TSTa + QFT-GIT, TSTa + IGRA, TSTb + T-SPOT.TB, TSTb + QFT-GIT 
and TSTb + IGRA were significantly superior predictors of progression. When 
evaluating the negative predictive performance of tests and strategies, negative 
results for TSTa + QFT-GIT were significantly poorer predictors of 
non-progression than negative results for TSTa, T-SPOT.TB and TSTa + IGRA. The 
most cost-effective LTBI testing strategies are the dual-testing strategies. The 
cost and QALY differences between the LTBI testing strategies were small; in 
particular, QFT-GIT, TSTb + T-SPOT.TB and TSTb + QFT-GIT had very similar 
incremental net benefit estimates.
CONCLUSION: This study found modest differences between tests, or combinations 
of tests, in identifying individuals who would go on to develop active TB. 
However, a two-step approach that combined TSTb with an IGRA was the most 
cost-effective testing option.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND FUTURE RESEARCH: The two-step TSTb strategy, which 
stratified the TST by prior BCG vaccination followed by an IGRA, was the most 
cost-effective approach. The limited ability of current tests to predict who 
will progress limits the clinical utility of tests. The implications of these 
results for the NHS England/Public Health England national TB screening 
programme for migrants should be investigated.

AIM: To investigate the efficacy of lactoferrin nanoparticles (LfNPs) in 
delivering siRNA across the blood-brain barrier to treat glioblastoma multiforme 
(GBM) and with an additional objective of potentiation of conventional 
temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy.
METHODS: Aurora kinase B (AKB) siRNA-loaded nanoparticles (AKB-LfNPs) were 
prepared with milk protein, lactoferrin, by water in oil emulsion method. 
AKB-LfNPs were tested in cell lines and in GBM orthotopic mouse model with and 
without TMZ treatment.
RESULTS: AKB silencing, cytotoxicity and cell cycle arrest by these LfNPs were 
shown to be effective on GL261 cells. Tumor growth was significantly lower in 
AKB-LfNPs alone and in combination with TMZ treated mice and increased the 
survival by 2.5-times.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of AKB-LfNPs to GBM mice improves life expectancy and has 
potential to combine with conventional chemotherapy.

Refractory celiac disease (RCD) is a rare condition, usually managed at 
specialized centers. However, gastroenterologists and pathologists in general 
practices are often the first to consider a diagnosis of RCD in celiac patients 
with persistent symptoms. The distinction between type I and type II RCD is 
crucial as patients with RCD II have a shortened life expectancy. The diagnosis 
of RCD II requires the demonstration of abnormal intraepithelial lymphocytes 
and/or monoclonal T-cell populations in duodenal biopsies, typically assessed in 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. We investigated the clinical 
significance of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements and CD3/CD8 staining in 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies from 32 patients with RCD I (4), RCD 
II (3), newly diagnosed celiac disease (CD) (10), established CD patients with 
follow-up biopsies (10), and Helicobacter pylori-associated lymphocytosis (5). 
Clonal T-cell populations were present in all lymphocytosis groups but not in 
normal controls. No difference in the frequency of clonal populations or 
persistence of identical clones was found between RCD I and II patients. The 
degree of villous blunting did not correlate with clonal status in any group. No 
difference in the number of CD3/CD8-positive intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 
enterocytes was found between groups. We suggest that clonal evaluation of T 
cells should not be employed routinely in the evaluation of CD patients with 
persistent symptoms until common causes of "apparent refractoriness" have been 
excluded. In addition, lymphocyte phenotyping and T-cell clonal analysis appear 
to be insufficient as stand-alone tests to reliably distinguish RCD I and II.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the predictive validity of an adapted version of the 
Minimum Data Set (MDS) Mortality Risk Index-Revised (MMRI-R) based on MDS 
version 3.0 assessment items (MMRI-v3) and to compare the predictive validity of 
the MMRI-v3 with that of a single MDS item indicating limited life expectancy 
(LLE).
DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional study of MDS assessments. Other data 
sources included the Veterans Affairs (VA) Residential History File and Vital 
Status File.
SETTING: VA nursing homes (NHs).
PARTICIPANTS: Veterans aged 65 and older newly admitted to VA NHs between July 
1, 2012, and September 30, 2015.
MEASUREMENTS: The dependent variable was death within 6 months of admission 
date. Independent variables included MDS items used to calculate MMRI-v3 scores 
(renal failure, chronic heart failure, sex, age, dehydration, cancer, 
unintentional weight loss, shortness of breath, activity of daily living scale, 
poor appetite, acute change in mental status) and the MDS item indicating LLE.
RESULTS: The predictive ability of the MMRI-v3 for 6-month mortality 
(c-statistic 0.81) is as good as that of the original MMRI-R (c-statistic 0.76). 
Scores generated using the MMRI-v3 had greater predictive ability than that of 
the single MDS indicator for LLE (c-statistic 0.76); using the 2 together 
resulted in greater predictive ability (c-statistic 0.86).
CONCLUSION: The MMRI-v3 is a useful tool in research and clinical practice that 
accurately predicts 6-month mortality in veterans residing in Veterans Affairs 
NHs. Identification of residents with LLE has great utility for studying 
palliative care interventions and may be helpful in guiding allocation of these 
services in clinical practice. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:2353-2359, 2018.

Introduction. Breast reconstruction, either immediate or delayed, is part of the 
treatment of breast cancer. Each country and health system pays for and 
evaluates these procedures in different ways. Thus, it is important to determine 
which strategy is most cost-effective in Colombia. Objective: To evaluate the 
cost-utility of breast cancer treatment with immediate reconstruction compared 
with delayed reconstruction. Materials and methods: We used a decision tree 
model and a one-year time horizon from the perspective of the third-party payer; 
the cost data were taken from the Colombian Instituto de Seguros Sociales 2001 
rate manual plus a 30% adjustment according to the methodology of the Instituto 
de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud, IETS, and the billing model of the Centro 
Javeriano de Oncología at the Hospital Universitario San Ignacio. The transition 
probabilities and profits were obtained from medical specialists, patients, and 
the medical literature. We also conducted univariate and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses. Results: The expected costs per capita were COP$ 
26,710,605 (USD$ 11,165) for the immediate reconstruction and COP$ 26,459,557 
(USD$ 11,060) for the deferred reconstruction. Immediate reconstruction 
generated an incremental cost of COP$ 251,049 (USD$ 105) and 0.75 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY), while deferred reconstruction generated 0.63 
QALYs, with an incremental cost-utility ratio of COP$ 2,154,675 per QALY (USD$ 
901). Conclusions: The cost per QALY did not exceed the acceptability threshold 
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The costs for the first year 
were similar. Both techniques are favorable for the Colombian health system, but 
the utility reported by patients and the literature is greater with the 
immediate reconstruction.

INTRODUCTION: The introduction of universal health insurance coverage aims to 
provide equal accessibility and affordability of health care, but whether such a 
policy eliminates health inequalities has not been conclusively determined. This 
research aims to examine the healthcare outcomes of oral cancer and determine 
whether the universal coverage system in Taiwan has reduced health inequality.
METHODS: Linking the databases of the National Cancer Registry with the National 
Mortality Registry in Taiwan, we stratified patients with oral squamous cell 
carcinoma by gender and income to estimate the incidence rate, cumulative 
incidence rate aged from 20 to 79 (CIR20-79), life expectancy, and expected 
years of life lost (EYLL). The difficulties with asymmetries and short follow-up 
periods were resolved through applying survival analysis extrapolation methods.
RESULTS: While all people showed a general improvement in life expectancy after 
the introduction of the NHI, the estimated change in EYLL's of the high-, 
middle-, and low-income female patients were found to have +0.3, -0.5 and -7 
years of EYLL, respectively, indicating a reduction in health inequality. 
Improvements for the male patients were unremarkable. There was no drop in the 
CIR20-79 of oral cancer in disadvantaged groups as in those with higher incomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal coverage alone may not reduce health inequality across 
different income groups for oral cancer unless effective preventive measures are 
implemented for economically disadvantaged regions.

Mortality rates for middle-aged whites in the U.S. are rising due to drugs, 
alcohol, and depression. Unique to our country, these "deaths of despair" 
disproportionately occur among the under-educated, who are at particular risk 
for dying young. At one time, less-educated persons aspired to work in the same 
factory as their parents, at union wages, with benefits. Those jobs, and the 
sense of community and prosperity and security they allowed, are evaporating. 
Many former workers suffer from chronic pain, which underlies America's ongoing 
opioid overdose epidemic. The pain is not only physical. It is psychic, 
spiritual, and economic.

PURPOSE: To investigate the cost effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with 
methotrexate, compared with methotrexate alone, for the management of uveitis 
associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis based on a clinical trial and decision analytic 
model.
PARTICIPANTS: Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age with persistently 
active uveitis associated with JIA, despite optimized methotrexate treatment for 
at least 12 weeks.
METHODS: The SYCAMORE (Randomised controlled trial of the clinical 
effectiveness, SafetY and Cost effectiveness of Adalimumab in combination with 
MethOtRExate for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated 
uveitis) trial (identifier, ISRCTN10065623) of methotrexate (up to 25 mg weekly) 
with or without fortnightly administered adalimumab (20 or 40 mg, according to 
body weight) provided data on resource use (based on patient self-report and 
electronic records) and health utilities (from the Health Utilities Index 
questionnaire). Surgical event rates and long-term outcomes were based on data 
from a 10-year longitudinal cohort. A Markov model was used to extrapolate the 
effects of treatment based on visual impairment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical costs to the National Health Service in the 
United Kingdom, utility of defined health states, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY.
RESULTS: Adalimumab in combination with methotrexate resulted in additional 
costs of £39 316, with a 0.30 QALY gain compared with methotrexate alone, 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £129 025 per QALY 
gained. The probability of cost effectiveness at a threshold of £30 000 per QALY 
was less than 1%. Based on a threshold analysis, a price reduction of 84% would 
be necessary for adalimumab to be cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab is clinically effective in uveitis associated with JIA; 
however, its cost effectiveness is not demonstrated compared with methotrexate 
alone in the United Kingdom setting.

INTRODUCTION: Tinnitus is present in a large part of chronic health complaints, 
and it is considered a public health problem injurious to the individual's 
quality of life. Considering the increase of the world population associated 
with an increase of life expectancy, tinnitus remains a cause for medical 
concern, since during aging the occurrence of auditory impairments due to the 
deterioration of the peripheral auditory structures and central impairs the 
quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to analyze the applicability of real 
ear measurements for audiological intervention of tinnitus through specific 
evaluation, selection, verification and validation of the hearing aids combined 
with the sound generator.
METHODS: Forty individuals of both genders with hearing loss and tinnitus 
complaints were deemed eligible to compose the sample. They were enrolled 
according to clinical symptoms and submitted to the following procedures: 
anamnesis and previous complaint history, high frequency audiometry, 
immittanciometry and acuphenometry with the research of psychoacoustic 
thresholds of pitch, loudness and minimum masking threshold, sound generator, in 
addition to the application of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Visual Analog 
Scale tools. The entire sample was adapted with Siemens hearing aids and a sound 
generator, participated in a counseling session with support of digital material 
and evaluated in two situations: Initial Assessment (before the hearing aids and 
sound generator adaptation) and Final Assessment (6 months, after adaptation). 
The statistical analyzes were descriptive and inferential, adopted a 
significance level of 5% and the T-Paired Test and the Spearman Correlation test 
were performed.
RESULTS: The results showed that there was a benefit with the use of hearing 
aids combined with a sound generator from the statistically significant values 
and strong correlations between the sound generator verification data regarding 
acuphenometry and the nuisance/severity questionnaires. Regarding the 
verification of the sound generator, it is important to highlight that the 
entire sample selected the effective acoustic stimulation based on the comfort 
levels, which was proved in the present study to be a sufficient intensity for 
positive prognosis, whereas the users' noises were found below the 
psychoacoustic thresholds of acuphenometry.
CONCLUSION: The present study concluded that the audiological intervention with 
any level of sound stimulus is enough to obtain a positive prognosis in the 
medium term. Data that specifies that the verification of sound generator was 
effective at the real ear measurements are important in the evaluation and 
intervention of the complaint. In addition, it points out that the greater the 
tinnitus perception, the greater its severity, and the greater the nuisance, the 
higher the psychoacoustics thresholds of frequency and the minimum threshold of 
masking.

INTRODUÇÃO: O zumbido está presente em grande parte das queixas crônicas de 
saúde, é considerado um problema de saúde pública, prejudicial à qualidade de 
vida do indivíduo. Considerando o aumento da população mundial associado ao 
aumento da expectativa de vida, a tendência é que o zumbido permaneça como um 
motivo de preocupação, uma vez que com a idade a ocorrência de prejuízos 
auditivos decorrentes da deterioração das estruturas auditivas periféricas e 
centrais ocasiona grande impacto negativo na qualidade de vida.
OBJETIVO: Analisar a aplicabilidade das medidas da orelha real para a 
intervenção audiológica do zumbido através de avaliação específica, seleção, 
verificação e validação do aparelho de amplificação sonora individual combinada 
ao gerador de som.
MÉTODO: Quarenta indivíduos de ambos os sexos com perda auditiva e queixa de 
zumbido foram considerados elegíveis para compor a amostra. Eles foram atendidos 
conforme a demanda clínica e submetidos aos seguintes procedimentos: anamnese e 
história pregressa da queixa, audiometria de alta frequência, imitanciometria e 
acufenometria com pesquisa dos limiares psicoacústicos de pitch, loudness e 
limiar mínimo de mascaramento, gerador de som, além da aplicação das ferramentas 
tinnitus handicap inventory e escala visual analógica. Toda a amostra recebeu 
aparelho de amplificação sonora individual e gerador de som, ambos da marca 
Siemens, participaram de uma sessão de aconselhamento com apoio de material 
digital e foram avaliados em duas situações: Avaliação inicial (antes da 
adaptação dos aparelhos de amplificação sonora individual e gerador de som) e 
Avaliação final (6 meses após a adaptação). As análises estatísticas foram 
descritivas e inferenciais, adotou-se um nível de significância de 5% com a 
realização do teste t pareado e o teste de correlação de Spearman.
RESULTADOS: Os resultados mostraram que houve benefício com o uso de aparelho de 
amplificação sonora individual combinado ao gerador de som com base nos valores 
estatisticamente significantes e fortes correlações entre os dados da 
verificação do gerador de som em relação à acufenometria e os questionários de 
incômodo/gravidade. Em relação à verificação do gerador de som, é importante 
destacar que toda a amostra selecionou a estimulação acústica efetiva baseada 
nos níveis de conforto e no presente estudo demonstraram ser de intensidade 
suficiente para o prognóstico positivo, enquanto que os ruídos dos usuários 
estavam abaixo dos limiares psicoacústicos da acufenometria.
CONCLUSÃO: A intervenção audiológica com qualquer nível de estímulo sonoro é 
suficiente para obter um prognóstico positivo em médio prazo. Os dados que 
demonstram que a verificação do gerador de som foi efetiva nas medidas da orelha 
real são importantes na avaliação e intervenção da queixa. Além disso, mostram 
que quanto maior a percepção do zumbido, maior a sua gravidade; e quanto maior o 
incômodo, maiores os limiares de frequência psicoacústica e o limiar mínimo de 
mascaramento.

OBJECTIVE: Native Americans (NAs) have worse healthcare outcomes over some 
measures than non-Native Americans (non-NAs) (i.e., lower life expectancy, 
higher heart disease and psychiatric disease rates). Little data exists to show 
if there are differences in the hospital course of burned NAs versus non-NA 
patients. The purpose of this study is to analyze the epidemiology, clinical 
course, and outcomes of NA burn injury in Arizona.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective database review of all burn center burn 
admissions from 2000 to 2015. This initial dataset of 12,724 patients included 
all initial presentations for burns, non-burns, and readmissions. From this 
database, we extracted all patients who were new admissions for burn injuries 
only. This resulted in 10,521 patients of which 9555 patients were non-NA 
patients and 966 were NA patients. The burn center collects sixty-eight data 
points to populate our burn database; of these data points, we reviewed 
twenty-nine to assess if differences existed.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences exist between the two groups with 
regard to age, geographic locality at time of burn, circumstances surrounding 
the injury, etiology of the injury, method of transport to the regional burn 
center, total length of stay, Injury Severity Score on admission, total percent 
total body surface area burned, month of year of burn injury, hospital charges, 
payor source for medical costs, and the final disposition. NA burn patients were 
more often burned at recreational than occupational sites and while 
participating in non-work related activities. Burn etiologies in NA patients 
were more frequently due to contact and flame. NA burn patients tended to have 
greater hospital length of stays and greater charges, and were less likely to be 
discharged home.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that NAs have a different experience with the 
healthcare system than non-NAs after a burn injury. The majority of these issues 
revolve around socioeconomic differences between the two groups.
