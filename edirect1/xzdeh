BACKGROUND: There remains much international practice variation regarding the 
choice of a unipolar or bipolar prosthesis design for displaced femoral neck 
fractures that are treated with hemiarthroplasty. The purpose of the present 
study was to compare revision rates following primary hemiarthroplasty for 
femoral neck fracture to determine if the unipolar hemiarthroplasty design 
increases the risk of revision arthroplasty for all causes.
METHODS: Instrumental variable analysis was performed with use of data that had 
been entered into the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint 
Replacement Registry from September 1, 1999, to December 31, 2018. Sixty-two 
thousand, eight hundred and seventy-five patients with femoral neck fractures 
that were treated with primary modular unipolar or bipolar hemiarthroplasty 
procedure were analyzed. Hospital preference for prosthesis design in the 12 
months prior to the index procedure was used as an instrument to adjust for 
unmeasured confounding. The primary outcome was time to first revision for any 
cause. Secondary analyses were performed on the reason for revision (infection, 
dislocation, periprosthetic fracture, or acetabular erosion), the use of cement 
femoral stem fixation, and the type of stem (polished or matte).
RESULTS: Modular unipolar hemiarthroplasty was associated with a higher rate of 
revision at >2.5 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.46 to 2.36; p < 0.001), but there was no difference between the groups before 
2.5 years (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.13; p = 0.79). Protective factors for 
revision included female sex (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.9), use of cemented 
fixation (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.77), and surgery performed in a public 
hospital setting (HR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.89). Modular unipolar prostheses 
had a greater risk of revision for acetabular erosion, particularly in later 
time periods (HR at ≥5.5 years, 5.10; 95% CI, 2.40 to 10.83; p < 0.001), while 
being protective against periprosthetic fractures (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59 to 
0.87; p < 0.001) at all time points. There was no difference in terms of the 
risk of revision for infection, dislocation, or stem type.
CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar hemiarthroplasty designs resulted in a lower risk of 
revision than unipolar designs. Unipolar hemiarthroplasties are justified for 
patients with femoral neck fracture and a shorter life expectancy (≤2.5 years).

Non-structural proteins (nsp) constitute the SARS-CoV-2 replication and 
transcription complex (RTC) to play a pivotal role in the virus life cycle. Here 
we determine the atomic structure of a SARS-CoV-2 mini RTC, assembled by viral 
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12) with a template-primer RNA, nsp7 and 
nsp8, and two helicase molecules (nsp13-1 and nsp13-2), by cryo-electron 
microscopy. Two groups of mini RTCs with different conformations of nsp13-1 are 
identified. In both of them, nsp13-1 stabilizes overall architecture of the mini 
RTC by contacting with nsp13-2, which anchors the 5'-extension of RNA template, 
as well as interacting with nsp7-nsp8-nsp12-RNA. Orientation shifts of nsp13-1 
results in its variable interactions with other components in two forms of mini 
RTC. The mutations on nsp13-1:nsp12 and nsp13-1:nsp13-2 interfaces prohibit the 
enhancement of helicase activity achieved by mini RTCs. These results provide an 
insight into how helicase couples with polymerase to facilitate its function in 
virus replication and transcription.

BACKGROUND: The need for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is commonly considered a 
predictor of poor survival, but life expectancy may vary depending on the 
underlying disease. We studied the factors associated with decreased survival 
and end-of-life characteristics in an unselected population of subjects starting 
NIV.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including 205 subjects initiating 
NIV from 1/1/2012-31/12/2015 who were followed up until 31/12/2017.
RESULTS: The median survival time was shorter in subjects needing help with 
activities of daily living than in independent subjects (hazard ratio (HR) for 
death 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.6, P = 0.008) and was also shorter in subjects on 
long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) than in those not on LTOT (HR for death 2.8, 95% 
CI 1.9-4.3, P < 0.001). There was marked difference in survival according to the 
disease necessitating NIV, and subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or 
interstitial lung disease seemed to have the shortest survival. The two most 
common diseases resulting in the need for NIV were chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). The median survival 
time was 4.4 years in COPD subjects, but the median survival time was not 
reached in subjects with OHS (HR for death COPD vs. OHS: 3.2, 95% CI 1.9-5.5, P 
< 0.001). Most of the deceased subjects (55.6%) died in the hospital, while only 
20.0% died at home. The last hospitalization admission leading to death occurred 
through the emergency room in 44.4% of the subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival among subjects starting NIV in this real-life study varied 
greatly depending on the disease and degree of functional impairment. Subjects 
frequently died in the hospital after admission through the emergency 
department. A comprehensive treatment approach with timely advance care planning 
is therefore needed, especially for those needing help with activities of daily 
living and those with both NIV and LTOT.

of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.

Asthma has been associated with an increased risk for developing schizophrenia. 
In addition, schizophrenia has been associated with an increased risk for 
developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, resulting in an elevated cardiovascular 
risk and in a limited life expectancy. It is well discussed that dysregulations 
related to Ca2+ signaling could link these diseases, in addition to cAMP 
signaling pathways. Thus, revealing this interplay among schizophrenia, 
diabetes, and asthma may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of these 
diseases. Publications involving Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways, 
schizophrenia, diabetes, and asthma (alone or combined) were collected by 
searching PubMed and EMBASE. Both Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways (Ca2+/cAMP 
signaling) control the release of neurotransmitters and hormones, in addition to 
airway smooth muscle contractility, then dysregulations of these cellular 
processes may be involved in these diseases. Taking into consideration, the 
experience of our group in this field, this narrative review debated the 
involvement of Ca2+/cAMP signaling in this link among schizophrenia, diabetes, 
and asthma, including its pharmacological implications.

During vertebrate development, the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) periodically 
segments into somites, which will form the segmented vertebral column and 
associated muscle, connective tissue, and dermis. The periodicity of 
somitogenesis is regulated by a segmentation clock of oscillating Notch 
activity. Here, we examined mouse mutants lacking only Fgf4 or Fgf8, which we 
previously demonstrated act redundantly to prevent PSM differentiation. Fgf8 is 
not required for somitogenesis, but Fgf4 mutants display a range of vertebral 
defects. We analyzed Fgf4 mutants by quantifying mRNAs fluorescently labeled by 
hybridization chain reaction within Imaris-based volumetric tissue subsets. 
These data indicate that FGF4 maintains Hes7 levels and normal oscillatory 
patterns. To support our hypothesis that FGF4 regulates somitogenesis through 
Hes7, we demonstrate genetic synergy between Hes7 and Fgf4, but not with Fgf8. 
Our data indicate that Fgf4 is potentially important in a spectrum of human 
Segmentation Defects of the Vertebrae caused by defective Notch oscillations.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) has emerged as a major public health 
concern. However, little is known about the burden attributable to specific risk 
factors. The present study aimed to estimate the temporal trends and 
geographical variation of CRC burden attributable to a diet low in milk in 
China.
METHODS: Following the general analytic strategy used in the 2017 Global Burden 
of Disease study, we assessed the age-, sex-, and province-specific mortality 
and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of CRC caused by a diet low in milk 
in China from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: In 2017, a diet low in milk contributed 32 032 [95% uncertainty 
interval (UI) = 11 350-53 806] deaths and 726 710 (95% UI = 256 651-1 218 153) 
DALYs for CRC with a population attributable fraction of 17.1%. The 
age-standardised mortality and DALY rates per 100 000 were 1.7 (95% 
UI = 0.6-2.9) and 36.8 (95% UI = 13.0-61.7), respectively. An upward trend with 
age in rates of mortality and DALYs was observed. Males had higher 
age-standardised rates than females. The number of deaths and DALYs increased 
significantly from 1990 to 2017, whereas the corresponding age-standardised 
rates showed relatively stable trends. In 2017, Hunan and Liaoning were ranked 
as the top two provinces in terms of disease burden. Socio-demographic index had 
a weak correlation with the age-standardised mortality (r = 0.348, P = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows a substantial increase in the CRC burden 
attributable to a diet low in milk over the past three decades. Greater priority 
in CRC prevention should be given to males and the elderly population throughout 
China, particularly in less-developed provinces.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy for persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection who receive recommended treatment can approach that of the general 
population, yet HIV remains among the 10 leading causes of death among certain 
populations. Using surveillance data, CDC assessed progress toward reducing 
deaths among persons with diagnosed HIV (PWDH).
METHODS: CDC analyzed National HIV Surveillance System data for persons aged ≥13 
years to determine age-adjusted death rates per 1,000 PWDH during 2010-2018. 
Using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, deaths with 
a nonmissing underlying cause were classified as HIV-related or non-HIV-related. 
Temporal changes in total deaths during 2010-2018 and deaths by cause during 
2010-2017 (2018 excluded because of delays in reporting), by demographic 
characteristics, transmission category, and U.S. Census region of residence at 
time of death were calculated.
RESULTS: During 2010-2018, rates of death decreased by 36.6% overall (from 19.4 
to 12.3 per 1,000 PWDH). During 2010-2017, HIV-related death rates decreased 
48.4% (from 9.1 to 4.7), whereas non-HIV-related death rates decreased 8.6% 
(from 9.3 to 8.5). Rates of HIV-related deaths during 2017 were highest by 
race/ethnicity among persons of multiple races (7.0) and Black/African American 
persons (5.6), followed by White persons (3.9) and Hispanic/Latino persons 
(3.9). The HIV-related death rate was highest in the South (6.0) and lowest in 
the Northeast (3.2).
CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and maintaining access to 
high-quality care and treatment have been successful in reducing HIV-related 
deaths and remain necessary for continuing reductions in HIV-related deaths.

OBJECTIVE: Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention (PP) 
of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) are well-established but underutilized globally. 
The Improve SCA study has identified a cohort of patients called 1.5 primary 
prevention (1.5PP) based on PP patients with the presence of certain risk 
factors. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ICD therapy compared to no ICD 
among the PP population and the subset of 1.5PP patients in Taiwan.
METHODS: A Markov model was run over a lifetime time horizon from the Taiwan 
payer perspective. Mortality and utility estimates were obtained from the 
literature (PP) and the IMPROVE SCA trial (1.5PP). Cost inputs were obtained 
from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA), Ministry of 
Health and Welfare. We used a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 
NT$2,100,000, as established through standard WTP research methods and in 
alignment with World Health Organization recommendations.
RESULTS: The total discounted costs for ICD therapy and no ICD therapy were 
NT$1,664,259 and NT$646,396 respectively for PP, while they were NT$2,410,603 
and NT$905,881 respectively for 1.5PP. Total discounted QALYs for ICD therapy 
and no ICD therapy were 6.48 and 4.98 respectively for PP, while they were 10.78 
and 7.71 respectively for 1.5PP. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was 
NT$708,711 for PP and NT$441,153 for 1.5PP, therefore ICD therapy should be 
considered cost effective for PP and highly cost effective for 1.5PP.
CONCLUSIONS: ICD therapy compared to no ICD therapy is cost-effective in the 
whole PP population and highly cost-effective in the subset 1.5PP population in 
Taiwan.

Aging is associated with functional and metabolic decline and is a risk factor 
for all noncommunicable diseases. Even though mice are routinely used for 
modeling human aging and aging-related conditions, no comprehensive assessment 
to date has been conducted on normative mouse aging. To address this gap, the 
Study of Longitudinal Aging in Mice (SLAM) was designed and implemented by the 
National Institute on Aging (NIA/NIH) as the mouse counterpart to the Baltimore 
Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). In this manuscript, we describe the premise, 
study design, methodologies, and technologies currently employed in SLAM. We 
also discuss current and future study directions. In this large population mouse 
study, inbred C57BL/6J and outbred UM-HET3 mice of both sexes are longitudinally 
evaluated for functional, phenotypic, and biological health, and collection of 
biospecimens is conducted throughout their life span. Within the longitudinal 
cohorts, a cross-sectional arm of the study has also been implemented for the 
well-controlled collection of tissues to generate a biorepository. SLAM and 
studies stemming from SLAM seek to identify and characterize phenotypic and 
biological predictors of mouse aging and age-associated conditions, examine the 
degrees of functional and biomolecular variability that occur within inbred and 
genetically heterogeneous mouse populations with age, and assess whether these 
changes are consistent with alterations observed in human aging in BLSA. The 
findings from these studies will be critical for evaluating the utility of mouse 
models for studying different aspects of aging, both in terms of interpreting 
prior findings and designing and implementing future studies.

OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a highly treatable neurologic 
condition that can cause psychosis. Screening for AE is not currently 
recommended in routine workup for first-episode psychosis (FEP), owing partly to 
the high cost of testing for AE-associated neuronal autoantibodies.
METHODS: This study used a decision-analytic model to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of routine serum screening for AE compared with clinically 
targeted screening in patients with FEP. Model parameters drawn from prior 
published literature included the prevalence of neuronal autoantibodies in FEP 
(4.5%), serum autoantibody panel cost (US $291), remission probability with 
antipsychotics (0.58), and remission probability with immunotherapy for patients 
diagnosed with AE (0.85). Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), assessed over a 5-year 
horizon from the US health care sector and societal perspectives. ICER 
thresholds of $50,000/QALY to $150,000/QALY were used to define 
cost-effectiveness. The analysis was conducted between June 2018 and January 
2020.
RESULTS: Routine screening led to mean QALY gains of 0.008 among all patients 
and 0.174 among the subgroup of patients with neuronal autoantibodies. Mean 
costs increased by $780 from a societal perspective and $1,150 from a health 
care sector perspective, resulting in ICERs of $99,330/QALY and $147,460/QALY, 
respectively. Incorporating joint input data uncertainty, the likelihood routine 
screening has an ICER ≤ $150,000/QALY was 55% from a societal perspective and 
37% from a health care sector perspective. The model parameter with the greatest 
contribution to overall uncertainty was the effectiveness of immunotherapy 
relative to antipsychotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine screening for AE in patients with FEP may be cost-effective 
in the United States. As further immunotherapy effectiveness data become 
available, a more definitive recommendation to perform routine screening could 
be warranted.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis is a rare, inherited, 
progressive disease caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene. We 
assessed the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with patisiran, an RNA 
interference therapeutic that inhibits TTR production, in patients with 
hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.
METHODS: This multicentre, open-label extension (OLE) trial enrolled patients at 
43 hospitals or clinical centres in 19 countries as of Sept 24, 2018. Patients 
were eligible if they had completed the phase 3 APOLLO or phase 2 OLE parent 
studies and tolerated the study drug. Eligible patients from APOLLO (patisiran 
and placebo groups) and the phase 2 OLE (patisiran group) studies enrolled in 
this global OLE trial and received patisiran 0·3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion 
every 3 weeks with plans to continue to do so for up to 5 years. Efficacy 
assessments included measures of polyneuropathy (modified Neuropathy Impairment 
Score +7 [mNIS+7]), quality of life, autonomic symptoms, nutritional status, 
disability, ambulation status, motor function, and cardiac stress, with analysis 
by study groups (APOLLO-placebo, APOLLO-patisiran, phase 2 OLE patisiran) based 
on allocation in the parent trial. The global OLE is ongoing with no new 
enrolment, and current findings are based on the interim analysis of the 
patients who had completed 12-month efficacy assessments as of the data cutoff. 
Safety analyses included all patients who received one or more dose of patisiran 
up to the data cutoff. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT02510261.
FINDINGS: Between July 13, 2015, and Aug 21, 2017, of 212 eligible patients, 211 
were enrolled: 137 patients from the APOLLO-patisiran group, 49 from the 
APOLLO-placebo group, and 25 from the phase 2 OLE patisiran group. At the data 
cutoff on Sept 24, 2018, 126 (92%) of 137 patients from the APOLLO-patisiran 
group, 38 (78%) of 49 from the APOLLO-placebo group, and 25 (100%) of 25 from 
the phase 2 OLE patisiran group had completed 12-month assessments. At 12 
months, improvements in mNIS+7 with patisiran were sustained from parent study 
baseline with treatment in the global OLE (APOLLO-patisiran mean change -4·0, 95 
% CI -7·7 to -0·3; phase 2 OLE patisiran -4·7, -11·9 to 2·4). Mean mNIS+7 score 
improved from global OLE enrolment in the APOLLO-placebo group (mean change from 
global OLE enrolment -1·4, 95% CI -6·2 to 3·5). Overall, 204 (97%) of 211 
patients reported adverse events, 82 (39%) reported serious adverse events, and 
there were 23 (11%) deaths. Serious adverse events were more frequent in the 
APOLLO-placebo group (28 [57%] of 49) than in the APOLLO-patisiran (48 [35%] of 
137) or phase 2 OLE patisiran (six [24%] of 25) groups. The most common 
treatment-related adverse event was mild or moderate infusion-related reactions. 
The frequency of deaths in the global OLE was higher in the APOLLO-placebo group 
(13 [27%] of 49), who had a higher disease burden than the APOLLO-patisiran (ten 
[7%] of 137) and phase 2 OLE patisiran (0 of 25) groups.
INTERPRETATION: In this interim 12-month analysis of the ongoing global OLE 
study, patisiran appeared to maintain efficacy with an acceptable safety profile 
in patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy. Continued long-term follow-up will be important for the overall 
assessment of safety and efficacy with patisiran.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate whether estimates of 
'potential gains in life expectancy' (PGLE) are potentially unreliable.
STUDY DESIGN: We compare the sum of the PGLEs from actual 1999-2017 reductions 
in U.S. mortality from all causes to the actual change in life expectancy of the 
entire population.
METHODS: Multiple-decrement life table techniques are used to calculate the 
PGLEs from the actual reductions in age-specific rates of mortality from 113 
causes. Then, the sum of the estimated PGLEs is compared to the actual change in 
life expectancy (LE) of the entire population.
RESULTS: The sum of the estimated gains in LE at birth is 40% larger than the 
actual increase in LE at birth: 2.7 years vs 1.9 years. The sum of the estimated 
gains in LE at age 65 years is 40% smaller than the actual increase in LE at age 
65 years: 1.0 years vs 1.7 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The fact that the sum of the estimated gains in LE from all 
diseases differs substantially (in both directions) from the actual increase in 
LE suggests that estimates of PGLE are potentially unreliable.

OBJECTIVES: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system 
that can interfere with cognitive functions. The purpose of this study is to 
document the impact of MS, aging and disease duration on cognitive functioning 
as both life expectancy and incidence of the disease among persons with MS 
(PwMS) aged 50 years and over (late-onset MS) are increasing in the last two 
decades.
METHODS: Exhaustive neuropsychological evaluation was performed in 84 PwMS (30 
young, 30 elderly adult-onset, 25 elderly late-onset) and 50 control 
participants (25 young, 24 elderly). ANCOVAs and hierarchical linear regressions 
were used to meet the objectives.
RESULTS: Interaction effects were found between age and presence of MS on higher 
executive function and information processing speed/working memory. After 
controlling for confounding variables (fatigue, quality of life, depression, MS 
course, comorbidity), results demonstrated an important role of age on all 
cognitive functions but only a trend of disease duration on information 
processing speed/working memory.
CONCLUSION: Decline in higher executive functions and information processing 
speed/working memory in aging is accentuated by the presence of MS, but the 
impact of age and MS on memory are independent. Age appears to be the variable 
having the most important role on cognition.

Lung Cancer Screening by Low-Dose Computed Tomography - Part 1: Expected 
Benefits, Possible Harms, and Criteria for Eligibility and Population Targeting.

BACKGROUND:  Trials in the USA and Europe have convincingly demonstrated the 
efficacy of screening by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) as a means to lower 
lung cancer mortality, but also document potential harms related to radiation, 
psychosocial stress, and invasive examinations triggered by false-positive 
screening tests and overdiagnosis. To ensure that benefits (lung cancer deaths 
averted; life years gained) outweigh the risk of harm, lung cancer screening 
should be targeted exclusively to individuals who have an elevated risk of lung 
cancer, plus sufficient residual life expectancy.
METHODS AND CONCLUSIONS:  Overall, randomized screening trials show an 
approximate 20 % reduction in lung cancer mortality by LDCT screening. In view 
of declining residual life expectancy, especially among continuing long-term 
smokers, risk of being over-diagnosed is likely to increase rapidly above the 
age of 75. In contrast, before age 50, the incidence of LC may be generally too 
low for screening to provide a positive balance of benefits to harms and 
financial costs. Concise criteria as used in the NLST or NELSON trials may 
provide a basic guideline for screening eligibility. An alternative would be the 
use of risk prediction models based on smoking history, sex, and age as a 
continuous risk factor. Compared to concise criteria, such models have been 
found to identify a 10 % to 20 % larger number of LC patients for an equivalent 
number of individuals to be screened, and additionally may help provide security 
that screening participants will all have a high-enough LC risk to balance out 
harm potentially caused by radiation or false-positive screening tests.
KEY POINTS:   · LDCT screening can significantly reduce lung cancer mortality. · 
Screening until the age of 80 was shown to be efficient in terms of cancer 
deaths averted; in terms of LYG relative to overdiagnosis, stopping at a younger 
age (e. g. 75) may have greater efficiency. · Risk models may improve the 
overall net benefit of lung cancer screening.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND:  Zahlreiche Studien in den USA und Europa haben zeigen 
können, dass durch Screening mit Niedrigdosis-Computertomografie (Low-Dose-CT, 
LDCT) der Lunge die Sterblichkeit an Lungenkrebs gesenkt werden kann, haben aber 
auch damit verbundene Risiken aufgezeigt, die sich durch ionisierende Strahlung, 
emotionalen Stress, Eingriffe infolge falsch positiver Befunde oder Überdiagnose 
ergeben. Um zu gewährleisten, dass die Risiken durch den möglichen Nutzen 
(abgewendeter Tod durch Lungenkrebs, Gewinn an Lebensjahren) aufgewogen werden, 
sollte Lungenkrebs-Screening auf Personen zielen, deren Lungenkrebsrisiko erhöht 
ist und deren verbleibende Lebenserwartung ausreichend hoch ist.
METHODEN UND SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN:  Im Ganzen beträgt die Senkung der 
Lungenkrebssterblichkeit durch LDCT-Screening ca. 20 %. In Anbetracht der mit 
dem Alter abnehmenden Lebenserwartung, insbesondere bei langjährigen aktiven 
Rauchern, nimmt das Risiko der Überdiagnose jenseits des 75. Lebensjahres 
deutlich zu. Vor dem 50. Lebensjahr ist die Lungenkrebsinzidenz hingegen zu 
gering, als dass Risiken und auch Kosten ein angemessener Nutzen gegenübersteht. 
Konzise Kriterien, wie in den NLST- und NELSON-Studien angewendet, stellen einen 
grundlegenden Anhalt für geeignete Einschlusskriterien dar. Ihnen stehen Modelle 
zur Risikoprädiktion gegenüber, die neben dem Geschlecht das Alter und die 
Rauchanamnese als kontinuierliche Variablen verwenden. Verglichen mit konzisen 
Kriterien konnten mithilfe dieser Modelle 10–20 % mehr Patienten mit Lungenkrebs 
bei gleicher Gesamtzahl gescreenter Personen identifiziert werden. Zugleich 
können sie zu einer größeren Sicherheit beitragen, dass die Screening-Teilnehmer 
ein ausreichend hohes Lungenkrebsrisiko haben, sodass die Risiken aufgrund von 
Strahlung und den Folgen falsch positiver Screening-Ergebnisse aufgewogen 
werden.
KERNAUSSAGEN:   · Durch LDCT-Screening kann die Lungenkrebssterblichkeit 
signifikant gesenkt werden.. · Um Überdiagnose zu beschränken, sollte nach dem 
75. Lebensjahr kein LDCT-Screening mehr erfolgen.. · Durch den Einsatz von 
Risikomodellen kann der Nettonutzen des Lungenkrebs-Screenings verbessert 
werden..

Systemic lupus erythematosus and infections.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an inflammatory and multi-systemic 
autoimmune disorder, characterized by an uncontrolled auto-reactivity of B and T 
lymphocytes, leading to the production of autoantibodies against self-directed 
antigens and tissue damage. The life expectancy in patients with SLE has 
improved tremendously in the last two decades, but the mortality rates still 
remain three times greater compared to those of the general population. Despite 
increased awareness and improved management, infections remain a major source of 
morbidity, mortality, hospitalization, and death in patients with SLE. The 
infections in SLE patients widely range from opportunistic to common bacterial 
and viral infections with typical or atypical presentations. Moreover, SLE 
patients exhibit an increased susceptibility to hospital-acquired infections. 
Factors associated with increased risk of infections include high disease 
activity, specific immune dysregulation, drug-induced immune deficiency, and 
organ failure with irreversible damage. Furthermore, immunosuppressive agents 
may make patients more susceptible to opportunistic infections. A big challenge 
faced by physicians in these patients is to distinguish between infections and 
flares of SLE, as infections may mimic them, leading to predicament in diagnosis 
and appropriate management. Immunosuppression used to treat severe flares of 
lupus can have catastrophic complications in patients with active infections. 
There is an urgent need for biomarkers to make an accurate differential 
diagnosis in this situation. In spite of increased understanding of SLE, many 
questions remain unanswered. Further research is needed to determine specific 
immune dysregulation underlying the increased susceptibility to specific 
infections, predictors of infection in SLE such as genetic markers, and 
biomarkers that discriminate between disease activity and active infections. 
Also, measures must be evaluated appropriately to prevent infections, and their 
complications in SLE.

Intensive and pharmacological care in times of COVID-19: A "special ethics" for 
emergency?

BACKGROUND: The Authors have laid out an analysis of Italian COVID-19 confirmed 
data and fatality rates, pointing out how a dearth of health care resources in 
northern regions has resulted in hard, ethically challenging decisions in terms 
of granting patient access to intensive care units (ICU).
MAIN TEXT: Having to make such decisions certainly entails substantial 
difficulties, and that has led many health care professional to seek ethical 
guidance. The Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and 
Intensive Care (SIAARTI) has attempted to meet that growing need by a set of 
recommendations, applying "clinical soundness" as a beacon standard; that 
approach tends to prioritize patients with higher life expectancy, which could 
be characterized as a "moderately utilitarian" approach. Yet, such a selection 
has engendered daunting ethical quandaries. The authors believe it can only be 
warranted and acceptable if rooted in a transparent decision-making process and 
verifiable, reviewed criteria. Moreover, the authors have stressed how clinical 
experimentation in a pandemic setting is a subtext of great interest from an 
ethical perspective. In Italy, no drug therapy and trials were undertaken for 
COVID-19 patients for a rather long period of time. When the epidemic was 
already circulating, an intervention proved necessary on the system of 
administrative procedures, aimed at expediting the authorization and validation 
of protocols, then bogged down by bureaucracy. A new system has since been 
instituted by a government decree that was signed about one month after the 
first Covid-19 case was officially recorded in the country. Such a swift 
implementation, which took just a few weeks, is noteworthy and proves that 
clinical trials can be initiated in a timely fashion, even with a pandemic 
unfolding. The concerted, action of supportive care and RCTs is the only way to 
attain effective forms of treatments for COVID-19 and any other future outbreak.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors have arrived at the conclusion that the most effective 
and ethically sound response on the part of any national health care system 
would be to adequately reconfigure its organizational mechanisms, by making 
clinical trials and all related administrative procedures consistent with the 
current state of emergency.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and preventable malignancy, and routine CRC 
screening is recommended for average risk individuals between the ages of 50 and 
75 years. Screening has been shown to decrease CRC incidence and mortality. Once 
patients are older than 75 years, the risk to benefit ratio of ongoing screening 
begins to shift. As comorbidities increase and life expectancy decreases, the 
future potential benefits of CRC prevention become less robust, and risk for 
screening-related complications grows. However, firm age cutoffs are not 
sufficient to guide these decisions, as there is substantial physiologic 
heterogeneity among individuals of the same age.
