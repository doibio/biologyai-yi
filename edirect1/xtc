research agenda. In summary, twin studies to date have raised more questions 
about the foetal origins hypothesis than they have resolved.

OBJECTIVE: This paper reports on the long-term outcome of patients with Kennedy 
Class IV partial edentulism treated in the Implant Prosthodontic Unit (IPU) at 
the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.
METHODS: The information for this paper was gathered from the charts of the 
first 30 consecutive, partially edentulous patients treated at the IPU. These 
patients all had Class IV edentulism and formed part of the original prospective 
clinical studies that were initiated in 1983. The patients' dental history 
suggested maladaptive experiences with traditional removable prostheses or a 
reluctance to have intact or quasi-intact teeth prepared as retainers for fixed 
prostheses. Fifteen men and 15 women treated with 94 Br nemark dental implants, 
supporting 34 prostheses, were followed until June 2000 (25 patients) or until 
they were lost to follow-up (5 patients). The multiple missing teeth occurred in 
19 maxillae and 15 mandibles.
RESULTS: The original prosthodontic treatments were intended to result in 33 
fixed partial prostheses and 1 overdenture. At the time of this report, 25 
patients with 86 implants supporting 31 fixed prostheses and 3 overdentures had 
been followed for an average of 12 years (range 7 16 years). The overall 
survival of implants was 92%. The difference between men (94%) and women (89%) 
was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: This report is an interim update on an ongoing long-term 
prospective study. The results so far demonstrate a high survival rate for Br 
nemark implants supporting tissue-integrated prostheses for the management of 
anterior partial edentulism.

Implant prosthodontic management of posterior partial edentulism: long-term 
follow-up of a prospective study.

Attard N(1), Zarb GA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, 
Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: This paper reports on the long-term outcome of implant-supported 
posterior-zone prostheses in the first 35 consecutive, partially edentulous 
patients treated in the Implant Prosthodontic Unit (IPU) at the University of 
Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.
METHODS: A total of 106 Brånemark dental implants were placed in 46 posterior 
edentulous spans in 35 patients for the management of multiple missing teeth; 
the patients were followed prospectively. Treatment planning principles involved 
a minimum of 2 or 3 implants at each edentulous site and scrupulous occlusal 
prosthodontic designs.
RESULTS: The overall survival of posterior implants was 94%. No factors in the 
patients' history adversely affected implant survival.
CONCLUSIONS: This clinical update suggests that the use of Brånemark implants in 
the rehabilitation of patients who are partially edentulous in the posterior 
zone is highly effective and that survival of the implants is excellent.

[Is heart rate reduction beneficial to patients with heart insufficiency? Focus 
on beta-blockade].

The aim of this review was to assess the effect of pharmacological reduction of 
the heart rate on prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure. Although a 
high heart rate is associated with a reduced life expectancy and causes a number 
of unwanted pathophysiological effects on the failing heart, there is no 
documentation that the beneficial effect of beta-blockers or other heart failure 
agents on survival is mediated through a reduction in heart rate.

Balancing the risks of stroke and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in older 
patients with atrial fibrillation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine how factors that increase the risk of major upper 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract hemorrhage (recent upper GI tract bleeding or 
concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) influence the choice of 
antithrombotic therapy in older patients (those > or = 65 years) with atrial 
fibrillation.
METHODS: For older patients with atrial fibrillation and no other 
contraindications to antithrombotic therapy, a Markov decision-analytic model 
was used to determine the preferred treatment strategy (no antithrombotic 
therapy, long-term aspirin use, or long-term warfarin sodium use) based on their 
risk of major upper GI tract hemorrhage. Input data were obtained by a 
systematic review of MEDLINE. Outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: For 65-year-old patients with average risks of stroke and upper GI 
tract bleeding, warfarin therapy was associated with 12.1 QALYs per patient; 
aspirin therapy, 10.8 QALYs; and no antithrombotic therapy, 10.1 QALYs. For 
persons with significantly higher risks of upper GI tract bleeding and/or lower 
risks of stroke, warfarin was no longer clearly the optimal antithrombotic 
therapy (eg, for 80-year-old persons with a baseline risk of stroke of 4.3% per 
year who were concurrently taking a conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug: warfarin, 7.44 QALYs; aspirin, 7.39 QALYs; and no treatment, 7.21 QALYs).
CONCLUSIONS: For older patients with atrial fibrillation and factors that place 
them at a higher than average risk of upper GI tract bleeding, the optimal 
choice of antithrombotic therapy to prevent stroke can vary according to the 
magnitude of this risk. Based on the risks of stroke and upper GI tract 
bleeding, clinicians can use the treatment recommendations of this study to 
provide rational stroke prevention therapy for older patients with atrial 
fibrillation.

Cumulative probability of live birth after three in vitro 
fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles.

Author information:
(1)Center for Reproductive Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Göteborg 
University, Göteborg, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the probability of live birth after three available in 
vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) cycles.
DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study.
SETTING: University hospital.
PATIENT(S): Nine hundred seventy-four couples who started their first 
conventional IVF or ICSI cycle between January 1996 and December 1997. A total 
of 1985 stimulated cycles were initiated.
INTERVENTION(S): Analysis of the cumulative live birth rate using the life-table 
approach with and without taking dropouts into account.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cumulative live birth rate.
RESULT(S): The overall cumulative live birth rate after three completed 
stimulated cycles (including freezing/thawing cycles) was 65.5% with an 
"optimistic" approach. For the "realistic" and "pessimistic" approaches the 
corresponding figures were 63.1% and 55.5%, respectively. Unexpectedly, 65% of 
couples not achieving a live birth interrupted the full treatment program of 
three cycles.
CONCLUSION(S): The cumulative live birth rate gives the couple a more accurate 
prognosis of achieving a live birth after IVF/ICSI than the statistics usually 
provided. With the "realistic" estimation, 63% of the couples achieved 
childbirth after three available conventional IVF or ICSI cycles. Further 
studies are required to investigate the high drop-out rate.

radiation vs. twice-daily thoracic radiation in patients with limited-stage 
small-cell lung cancer(1).

PURPOSE: We undertook an analysis of quality-adjusted survival using the Q-TWiST 
(Quality Time Without Symptoms or Toxicity) methodology and developed a new 
graphic representation called a quality-adjusted life-years plot, which presents 
a complete and concise Q-TWiST analysis on a single plot.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Q-TWiST plot incorporates the time without symptoms 
or toxicity and several combinations of utility coefficients for toxicity and 
relapse days into the same plot. In addition, the plot includes threshold lines, 
to judge whether a particular combination of utility coefficients reaches a 
significance level.
RESULTS: The differential in toxicity incidence and severity between the two 
thoracic radiation treatment arms was inconsequential. Sensitivity analyses were 
run using Q-TWiST plots. For all combinations of the various toxicity 
definitions and utility coefficients, the median Q-TWiST was greater for the 
once-daily thoracic radiation treatment arm than for the twice-daily treatment 
arm, without achieved significance.
CONCLUSION: This work refines the results previously reported for this Phase III 
clinical trial in patients with limited-stage small-cell cancer, and there was 
no significant difference in survival after adjusting for toxicity and 
progression. Furthermore, the new methods developed for this trial allow for a 
more detailed and parsimonious presentation of survival and toxicity data for 
all oncology clinical trials.

Whole brain radiotherapy (RT) is frequently used to palliate symptoms in 
patients with brain metastases, but the palliative benefit to patients has not 
been well documented. We conducted a longitudinal observational prospective 
study of patients receiving standard RT (20 Gray (Gy)/5 fractions) for 
symptomatic brain metastases. End-points were observer rating of neurological 
symptoms, patient-rated symptoms, performance status, neurological functional 
status, cognitive function and quality of life (QOL). Median survival for the 75 
patients was 86 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 65-101 days). At 1 month, 
19% of patients showed an improvement or resolution of presenting symptoms, 23% 
were stable and 55% had progressed or died. Patient-rated symptoms were 
increased at 1 month in comparison to baseline data. Only 4 patients had an 
improved performance status and 22 were stable. Many patients with brain 
metastases have a short life expectancy and may not benefit from even short 
duration radiation schedules. Further effort is needed to optimise patient 
selection and tailor treatment appropriately.

    Br J Psychiatry. 2002 Mar;180:198-9.

BACKGROUND: Aggregate returns give limited information about those detained 
under the Mental Health Act 1983.
AIMS: To use existing data-sets to examine detentions under Part II of the Act.
METHOD: Data from 26 areas, with a combined population of 9.2 million, were 
combined. Population census data were used to standardise rates of detention by 
age, gender and ethnicity.
RESULTS: The 31 702 detentions are distributed bimodally with peaks at age 25-34 
years and at over age 80 years. In the younger age group rates of detention are 
higher for men. The excess of women in the older group is no longer apparent 
when rates are standardised for age and gender. Detentions are over six times 
more likely to be of Black people than of White (450 v. 68 per standardised 100 
000 population).
CONCLUSIONS: The difference in rates of detention between Black and White people 
is greater than previously thought. The excess of older women detained under 
Part II of the Act is largely due to the lower life expectancy of men.

Routine duplex surveillance does not improve the outcome after carotid 
endarterectomy: a decision and cost utility analysis.

BACKGROUND: Doppler ultrasound (duplex) tests are commonly applied after carotid 
endarterectomy to detect possible recurrent stenosis. The appropriate frequency 
and the benefits are unknown. We investigated the costs and effects of various 
follow-up strategies to determine the optimal strategy after carotid 
endarterectomy.
METHODS: Using decision-analytic methods, a Monte Carlo Markov model was 
constructed. Probabilities and costs were obtained by systematic literature 
review. From empirical data regarding restenosis, a disease model was 
constructed to test the effect of various follow-up strategies using duplex 
testing and angiography. Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), probability of stroke, and costs (for both the Dutch and the American 
situation).
RESULTS: The average quality-adjusted life expectancy for a 66-year-old patient 
was 6.31 years for the symptom-guided strategy (with duplex scanning only being 
performed in case of symptoms of cerebral ischemia). The mean lifetime costs for 
this strategy were $5 600 for the US and 4 600 Euro for the Netherlands. The 
cumulative probability of stroke was 13%. Yearly routine duplex tests up to 5 
years after operation resulted in similar QALYs and a similar probability of 
stroke, but higher costs ($7 300 for the US and 5 600 Euro for The Netherlands 
situation). No other strategy, including routine duplex surveillance, increased 
QALYs. When MR instead of conventional angiography was used as confirmatory 
test, no improvement was observed either.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine duplex surveillance does not result in an increase in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, but it does increase costs. After successful 
carotid endarterectomy, a symptom-guided follow-up is an appropriate approach.

Coronary heart disease risk factors in the elderly.

Kannel WB(1).

Clinical Research, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.

Hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and obesity remain the 
major modifiable risk factors for most of the coronary disease afflicting the 
elderly. The relative risk associated with these established risk factors 
diminishes with advancing age, but this is offset by a greater absolute and 
attributable risk. Diabetes is increasing alarmingly in prevalence and operates 
more powerfully in women, eliminating their coronary disease resistance 
(relative to men). Interest in this entity now focuses on the insulin resistance 
syndrome promoted by abdominal obesity that has become so common in the elderly. 
The isolated systolic hypertension and large pulse pressure that predominate in 
the elderly is now recognized as a coronary disease hazard. Dyslipidemia, 
characterized by a high total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, is 
the most predictive lipid profile for coronary disease in the elderly. High 
triglycerides, accompanied by low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol usually 
signifies insulin resistance and more atherogenic, small, dense low-density 
lipoprotein. Left ventricular hypertrophy is an ominous harbinger of coronary 
disease. Fibrinogen and the leukocyte count are correlated coronary disease risk 
factors that may indicate unstable lesions. Novel risk factors, such as 
hemostatic factors, homocysteine, lipoprotein(a), C-reactive protein, and 
hyperinsulinemia, are worthy of attention, but the efficacy of correcting them 
in the elderly has not yet been demonstrated. Nor has the efficacy of hormone 
replacement therapy in women. All the coronary risk factors tend to cluster, and 
the hazard posed by each is greatly influenced by the burden of coexisting risk 
factors. High-risk elderly candidates for coronary disease can be efficiently 
targeted for treatment by global risk assessment, using only the major 
established risk factors. The distinction between primary and secondary 
prevention in the elderly is less clear than in the middle-aged because they 
often have advanced presymptomatic vascular pathology that imposes a coronary 
event rate comparable to that of the middle-aged who have already sustained a 
clinical event. Declines in coronary mortality rates in the United States have 
included the elderly, justifying optimism about the efficacy of preventive 
measures. Most of the elderly have sufficient remaining life expectancy to 
warrant vigorous preventive management. Trials of risk factor modification in 
the elderly indicate that decades of exposure to modifiable risk factors can be 
countered by measures implemented late in life.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of interferon beta in multiple sclerosis: a Markov 
process analysis.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of 
preventive treatment with interferon beta (IFNB) versus no preventive treatment 
in patients with multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: The setting for this study was the United Kingdom. A lifetime Markov 
process model was constructed to model the average quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and the costs of both treatment strategies. Data for the construction of 
the model came from published literature, including large multicenter randomized 
clinical trials in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple 
sclerosis. Costs were obtained from published sources.
RESULTS: The results of the baseline analysis from the National Health Service 
(NHS) perspective showed that the use of interferon beta as preventive treatment 
for MS increased the total average discounted cost from 51,214 Pounds to 221,436 
Pounds per patient. The undiscounted effectiveness increased from 24.9 QALYs to 
28.2 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 51,582 
Pounds per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of this model for 
other interferons.
CONCLUSION: The study showed that preventive treatment with interferon beta in 
patients with multiple sclerosis may not be fully justified from a 
health-economic perspective, although interferon beta is associated with an 
improved effectiveness compared with no preventive treatment.

Is subjective well-being a useful parameter for allocating resources among 
public interventions?

Gandjour A(1).

Author information:
(1)Institute of Health Economics and Clinical Epidemiology, University of 
Cologne, Germany. afschin.gandjour@medizin.uni-koeln.de

Scarce public resources require trade-offs between competing programs in 
different sectors, and the careful allocation of fixed resources within a single 
sector. This paper argues that a general quality of life instrument encompassing 
health-related and non-health-related components is suitable for determining the 
best trade-offs between sectors. Further, this paper suggests that subjective 
well-being shows the properties crucial to a general quality of life measure and 
has additional advantages that makes it particularly useful for the allocation 
of public and health care resources. The paper argues that Western societies are 
in an unusually prosperous situation today which allows to concentrate efforts 
not only on reducing harm but also on improving positive states of health. 
Further, subjective well-being can be evaluated from the patient's perspective 
and incorporates a valuation of life expectancy. Criteria required for an 
appropriate questionnaire that measures subjective well-being are presented.

Serum pharmacokinetics and tissue and milk residues of oxytetracycline in goats 
following a single intramuscular injection of a long-acting preparation and milk 
residues following a single subcutaneous injection.

Separate groups of goats were used to determine drug depletion patterns in serum 
(n=10), tissue (n=20) and milk (n=8) following a single intramuscular (i.m.) 
dose of 20 mg/kg of a long-acting oxytetracycline (OTC) formulation (Liquamycin 
LA-200). Milk residues were also determined following a subcutaneous (s.c.) 
administration of the same product at the same dose. Serum samples were taken 
for 24 h post-treatment and tissues (fat, liver, kidney, muscle and injection 
site) collected at 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days following injection. Milk from 
lactating goats was collected every 12 h for 8 days following both the i.m. and 
s.c. treatments utilizing an intervening 5-week washout period. Residues in 
serum and tissue were measured using a microbial inhibition assay, while milk 
residues were measured using both a microbial inhibition assay and a validated 
HPLC method. The serum pharmacokinetic parameters of OTC in goats were 
determined, with a mean AUC=67.4 microg h/mL, mean terminal half-life=14.4 h, 
and apparent clearance=0.33 L/kg h. Tissue half-lives could not be determined 
with confidence because the collection times provided only two points at which 
residues could be measured for most tissues. Oxytetracycline residues in all 
goat tissue samples measured less then cattle tissue tolerance by 96 h 
postdosing. One-compartment model describing milk depletion data for i.m. and 
s.c. dosing had terminal slope half-lives of 20.1 and 36.1 h, respectively. By 
96 h post-treatment none of the milk samples contained OTC residues in excess of 
the cattle milk tolerance (0.3 p.p.m.). For both milk and tissue, the 
upper-bound 99% confidence intervals for the samples taken from goats 96 h 
postdosing were lower than approved cow milk and tissue tolerances.

Improved outcome of cervical neoplasia in HIV-infected women in the era of 
highly active antiretroviral therapy.

wrobinson@harringtoncc.org

Cervical neoplasia has been associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection. Both preinvasive disease and invasive cervical cancer have been 
reported to have a much poorer outcome in HIV-infected women than in the general 
population. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted 
in significant improvements in the treatment of HIV infection, including a 
decrease in the incidence and severity of several acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome (AIDS)-related malignancies. Two cases of cervical dysplasia in 
HIV-infected women are presented, one from the pre-HAART era, who subsequently 
developed invasive cervical cancer and died, and one in whom HAART was used with 
good outcome. Data from several reports of the use of HAART in HIV-infected 
women indicates that the prognosis for cervical neoplasia is improved. Possible 
reasons for this improvement include better immune function seen in 
HAART-treated women, as well as increased surveillance for cervical neoplasia in 
HIV-infected women in recent years. However, the future impact of improved HIV 
care, including HAART, on cervical neoplasia is unclear.

Incremental cost-effectiveness of initial cataract surgery.

Busbee BG(1), Brown MM, Brown GC, Sharma S.

Author information:
(1)Center for Evidence-Based Health Care Economics, Wills Eye Hospital, 
Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform a reference case, cost-utility 
analysis of initial cataract surgery using the current literature on cataract 
outcomes and complications.
DESIGN: Computer-based econometric modeling.
METHODS: Visual acuity data of patients treated and observed over a 4-month 
postoperative period was obtained from the US National Cataract Patient Outcomes 
Research Team (PORT). The results from this prospective study were combined with 
other studies that investigated the complication rates of cataract surgery to 
complete the cohort of patients and outcomes. These synthesized data were 
incorporated with time-tradeoff utility values, decision analysis, and 
econometric modeling to account for the time value of money.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained 
was calculated for the study group undergoing cataract extraction in the first 
eye when the vision was the same in both eyes. This was divided into the cost of 
the procedure to find the year 2000 nominal US dollars spent per 
quality-adjusted life-year ($/QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Initial cataract surgery, compared with observation, resulted in a mean 
gain of 1.776 QALYs per patient treated. A 3% annual discount rate was used to 
account for the benefit over time, yielding 1.25 QALYs gained. The mean cost of 
treatment (also discounted at a 3% annual rate) of each patient totaled 2525 US 
dollars. The cost divided by the discounted benefit resulted in $2020/QALY 
gained for this procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Initial cataract surgery seems to be highly cost-effective compared 
with procedures across multiple medical specialties. This information, 
incorporating patient preferences into evidenced-based medicine, will play an 
increasingly important role in the evaluation of health care in the future.

L-deprenyl (Selegiline) used in the treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's 
disease also enhances longevity. Oxidized low density lipoprotein promotes 
atherosclerosis and is toxic to both vascular and neural tissue. The reported 
association between vascular dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases prompted 
us to investigate the effect of l-deprenyl, a MAO-B inhibitor, on low density 
lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. LDL was isolated from freshly collected blood and 
the kinetics of copper induced oxidation of LDL was monitored continuously by 
spectrophotometry. Oral administration (10 mg) or in vitro (2.8 to 84 microM) 
addition of l-deprenyl inhibited oxidation of LDL isolated from healthy men and 
post-menopausal women. This is the first report demonstrating that the 
antioxidant action of l-deprenyl may be antiatherogenic and cardioprotective. 
Such an action could contribute to reported extension of life span associated 
with long-term administration of the drug. In conjunction with inhibition of LDL 
oxidation, l-deprenyl is unique in that it demonstrates protective effects on 
both vascular and neuronal tissue. Prophylactic use of low doses of l-deprenyl 
may accord protection against vascular and neurodegenerative diseases associated 
with aging.

The first mortality follow-up study: the 1841 Report of William Farr (physician) 
on the mortality of lunatics.

Singer RB.

BACKGROUND: In the 1830s in England, there was a great cultural interest in the 
collection and publishing of all kinds of statistics. The Council of the 
Statistical Society of London (founded in 1834) commissioned one of its Fellows, 
Dr William Farr, to investigate and prepare a report on the mortality of 
patients in the county asylums, with the mortality in a large number of 
proprietary houses that were licensed to care for patients with mental illness 
(then called lunatics) ordered for confinement because of their mental 
condition. Committees of Parliament had investigated the condition of the 
mentally ill confined to the asylums and taken measures in an attempt to improve 
their treatment and to correct abuses.
RESULTS: Farr collected data from Hanwell, the Middlesex County asylum opened in 
1831, and other asylums on annual admissions, resident patients, deaths, 
discharges, derived years of residence (exposure to risk), and annual mortality 
rates by duration and as an aggregate. He used similar data from a recent report 
on a large number of licensed houses. For the best estimate of comparative 
mortality, an assumed age distribution by sex and rates from the English Life 
Table No. 1 (constructed by Farr for 1841).
CONCLUSION: Farr demonstrated that annual mortality rates were higher at 
durations 0-1.5 years than at durations 1.5-7.5 years, higher in men than in 
women, higher in paupers than in other patients, higher in licensed houses than 
in the Hanwell Asylum, and higher in the 4 large licensed houses than in a 
collection of smaller ones.
COMMENT: A brief sketch of Farr's life is given as a memorial tribute to his 
pioneer work in vital statistics, life table methodology, public health, and 
life insurance medicine.

Life table methodology applied to NHANES II database for analysis of mortality 
associated with cholesterol/HDL ratios.

Wesley D, Ingle D.

This article describes the association between total cholesterol to high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratios and all-cause mortality in a large cohort 
of Americans with nearly 17 years of follow-up. Detailed actuarial life table 
methodology was used. It concludes that the relationship is best described as a 
J-shaped curve.

OBJECTIVES: To provide reference expected cumulative survival tables, reducing 
steps in the calculation of mortality ratios and excess death rates from the 
medical literature, when source data are in terms of survival curves or 
cumulative survival rates.
METHOD: Actuarial methodology.
RESULTS: Tables provide cumulative expected survival rates calculated by entry 
age and for different periods of follow-up, as used in clinical trials and 
registries in the medical literature.
CONCLUSION: The observed survival in scientific papers can be appraised promptly 
using cumulative survival tables calculated from either insurance or population 
life tables.

This paper is a commentary to the MISA study (Meta-analysis of Italian studies 
on short-term effects of air pollution). The interpretation of the relationships 
observed in the time-series analyses is not straightforward. I will review a 
number of open questions: the exposure estimates; the meaning of the daily 
mortality and hospitalisation rates, in terms of impact on life expectancy, 
incidence of specific diseases, exacerbation of preexisting chronic diseases; 
the pattern of the estimated dose-response curves; the role of possible effect 
modifiers; the hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms. These interpretative 
problems often present overlapping aspects. Some of the pending answers are 
relevant for policy making. For editorial reasons this review is divided in two 
parts. A first paper, focusing on the exposure estimates, has been published on 
the previous issue of this journal. This second part deals with the meaning of 
the outcome variable, the shape of the dose-response curves, possible effect 
modifiers and underlying mechanisms.

Initial bone marrow aspiration in childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenia: 
decision analysis.

Klaassen RJ(1), Doyle JJ, Krahn MD, Blanchette VS, Naglie G.

Canada. rklaassen@cheo.on.ca

PURPOSE: Bone marrow aspiration (BMA) is routinely performed before starting 
steroid therapy in children with idiopathic thrombocytopenia, primarily to rule 
out leukemia.
METHODS: A decision tree for the initial management of a child older than age 6 
months, presenting with idiopathic thrombocytopenia, without blasts on the 
peripheral smear was constructed. The three strategies are: 1) initial BMA in 
all patients; 2) initial BMA only in patients at high risk; and 3) empiric 
therapy for all patients without initial BMA. High-risk criteria include any of: 
platelet count >50 x 10(9)/L; hemoglobin <100 g/L (age younger than 12 months) 
or <110 g/L (age older than 12 months): white blood cell count <5 x 10(9)/L 
(younger than 6 years) or <4 x 10(9)/L (older than 6 years); or absolute 
neutrophil count <1.5 x 10(9)/L (younger than 6 years) or <2 x 10(9)/L (older 
than 6 years). The results are expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
a measure that estimates the overall life expectancy in years for patients 
receiving a particular treatment strategy, corrected for the patient's quality 
of life.
RESULTS: The base case results are: 1) BMA all = 69.649 QALYs; 2) high-risk BMA 
= 69.652 QALYs; and 3) empiric therapy = 69.644 QALYs. These results indicate a 
three-way toss-up because there is less than a 4-day quality-adjusted difference 
(0.01) between strategies.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the initial BMA does not significantly 
change the overall QALYs of a child presenting with thrombocytopenia and, 
consequently, is not mandatory in every patient before starting steroids.

Seizures in the critically ill: the role of imipenem.

Koppel BS(1), Hauser WA, Politis C, van Duin D, Daras M.

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, Metropolitan Hospital Center, New York, New York 
10029, USA.

PURPOSE: To determine the risk of seizures in critically ill patients receiving 
the antibiotic imipenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that has been associated 
with seizures. Reports generally have not considered other contributing factors 
such as dose, seizure history, and morbidity index of the underlying illness 
necessitating the antibiotic.
METHODS: Charts of all patients in a 450-bed municipal hospital who received 
imipenem in a 6-month period, as determined by pharmacy records, were reviewed 
for dosage and duration of imipenem use, occurrence of seizures. and mortality 
outcome. Attention was paid to demographic features; pattern of seizure 
occurrence during, before, and after imipenem use; renal function; and 
correction for dosage based on size.
RESULTS: Seventy-five charts were reviewed. Sixty-three patients had no seizures 
during the hospitalization, four had seizures while receiving imipenem, and 
eight had seizures during the hospitalization but before or after imipenem use. 
The incidence of seizures was 4/1,000 patient-days on, and 3.9/1,000 
patient-days off imipenem (not significant). The risk of seizure in both groups 
was considerably higher in those patients with a history of seizures before 
hospitalization. The presence of other factors that could contribute to 
increased concentration of imipenem in the brain, such as renal failure or acute 
stroke, did not contribute to seizure incidence. Metabolic derangement, anoxia, 
and phenytoin discontinuation did contribute to seizure incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Seizure incidence is increased in all critically ill patients (16% 
of patients studied), but with no added risk during the period patients received 
imipenem. Determining the proper dose based on a patient's body mass, correction 
of dose in the presence of renal failure, and avoidance of excess of 2 g/day of 
imipenem removes any added risk for seizures from imipenem. Despite experimental 
data to suggest action of imipenem on the glutamate/N-methyl-d-aspartate 
receptor, or interference with binding to the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor, 
and early clinical studies that warned against its use because of seizure risk, 
we found that careful use of this antibiotic is safe.

Evaluation of the QALY model for analysis of cost-effectiveness of eating 
training after stroke.

New methods developed and insights gained in research are of increasing 
significance in health care and the question is which services and methods are 
to be implemented. If eating training after stroke is to be implemented it must 
be given priority in relation to other measures. Otherwise there is a risk that 
patients with eating difficulties after stroke will be fed by personnel or 
permanently receive nourishment via tube. This may lead to expensive measures or 
costs for the tube feeding as well as costs for the personnel needed for 
feeding, and patients' well-being will be reduced if they do not have the 
opportunity to eat as independently as possible. Economic analyses should not 
guide the priorities to be made, but can be one of several bases for resource 
allocation. The estimation of cost-effectiveness must, however, be made by means 
of a method which in its ethical foundation is in line with nursing and the 
Swedish Government Bill for guiding priorities in health care. The aim of this 
paper is to discuss the ethical foundation of nursing care and the ethical 
principles proposed by the Swedish Government Bill for guiding priorities in 
health care and the model of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) related to 
eating training after stroke. The findings showed that there was a considerable 
difference in the ways health and health maximization were discussed in the QALY 
model and in specific nursing care. There are two aspects underpinning the QALY 
model that are not in line with either the ethical foundations of nursing or the 
principles proposed by the Swedish Government Bill for guiding priorities in 
health care. However, a new method called Equity Adjusted Life Years (EQALYs) 
can be a tool for evaluation in specific nursing care. Cost per EQALY is based 
on a compromise between initial severity of disease and treatment effect that is 
very close to the distribution rule applied in specific nursing care. In 
conclusion it is obvious that cost per EQALY, a balance between health 
maximization and severity of disease and treatment effects, can be a tool for 
the evaluation of eating training after stroke.

The objective of this study is to give objective data about neuro-orthopaedic 
status of the population of polyhandicapped patients for improving both our 
medical and surgical practices.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: It was a multicentre, cross-sectional study to describe the 
population of polyhandicapped patients over 15 years of age. Each person was 
provided with clinical examination and X rays to detect scoliosis, pelvis 
obliquity and hip excentration (subluxation or dislocation) and other factors 
associated with polyhandicap. Polyhandicap was defined as a severe handicap 
linking physical and mental disability and responsible for extreme restriction 
of autonomy.
RESULTS: One hundred and twelve persons were studied. Mean age was 27.2 years. 
Etiology of the handicap was neonatal asphyxia (38.3% of patients). 69.0% of 
patients had no possibility to turn over in lying position. Orthopaedic status 
was serious : 75.9% scoliosis, 65.2% pelvis obliquity (75% left and 25% right), 
19.1% hip dislocation. General condition was precarious : one patient in two had 
a weight judged lower than normal weight, 32.5% had bedsores, 45.2% suffered 
from hip pain and only 13.6% received treatment against pain.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The description of general and neuro-orthopaedic 
status of these 120 people with polyhandicap cannot leave us indifferent. 
Although life expectancy in this population was lower than in normal 
populations, we are faced with life process and no with accompanying the 
terminally ill. We urgently need to review preventive care in terms of quality 
and quantity as well as surgical proposals for treating spasticity in children 
and adults.

CDC's strategic plan for bioterrorism preparedness and response.

Koplan J(1).

bdl2@cdc.gov

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has played a critical lead 
role over the past two years in fostering activities associated with the medical 
and public health response to bioterrorism. Based on a charge from Secretary 
Donna Shalala in 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is 
leading public health efforts to strengthen the nation's capacity to detect and 
respond to a bioterrorist event. As a result of our efforts, federal, state, and 
local communities are improving their public health capacities to respond to 
these types of emergencies. For many of us in public health, developing plans 
and capacities to respond to acts of bioterrorism is an extension of our 
long-standing roles and responsibilities. These are stated in the CDC Mission 
Statement: to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling 
disease, injury, and disability, and the Bioterrorism Mission: to lead the 
public health effort in enhancing readiness to detect and respond to 
bioterrorism. CDC's infectious diseases control efforts are summarized below: 
--Initially formed to address malaria control in 1946; --Established the 
epidemic Intelligence Service in 1951; --Participated in global smallpox 
eradication and other immunization programs; --Estimated 800-1,000 + field 
investigations/year since late 1990s; --New diseases: Legionnaire's Disease, 
toxic shock syndrome, Lyme disease, HIV, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, West 
Nile, etc. -- Today: focus on emerging infections and bioterrorism. Over the 
past 50 years, CDC has seen a decline in the incidence of some infectious 
diseases and an increase in some, whereas others continue to present on a more 
unpredictable basis (i.e., hantavirus). Outbreak identification, investigation, 
and control have been an integral part of what we do for more than 50 years. We 
estimate that 800 to 1,000 field investigations have occurred every year since 
the late 1990s. Today, however, we have a new focus on emerging infectious 
diseases and bioterrorism.

Chemotherapy in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer: indication, intensity, and 
duration.

Booton R(1), Thatcher N.

Author information:
(1)CRC Department of Medical Oncology, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, 
United Kingdom.

Platinum-based combination and single-agent chemotherapy have become accepted as 
treatments for locally advanced and metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer as a 
consequence of improved survival, quality of life, and symptom control compared 
with best supportive care. However, it is clear that a therapeutic plateau has 
been reached with current combinations requiring a re-evaluation of strategies 
to improve clinical outcomes. Dose intensification may offer one way in which to 
achieve better results, as may extension of the duration of treatment. The 
evidence suggests that dose intensification is a useful tool, and that its use 
in combination with markers of treatment duration and cumulative dose may help 
to maximize results from current active drug combinations.

Economic antecedents of mortality among the very old.

Catalano R(1).

rayc@uclink4.berkeley.edu

BACKGROUND: The 140-year trend of increased longevity in the developed world 
continues with no end in sight. Much of this trend has been attributed to 
mechanisms in which the benefits of economic growth act on the young. No 
attempts have been made to reconcile these theories with the experience of the 
very old.
METHODS: Using Swedish data for the years 1861 through 1999, I examine the 
relationship between manufacturing wages and the odds of dying among persons 
90-94 years of age.
RESULTS: The findings imply that the odds of death among persons 90-94 years of 
age in Sweden for the years 1862 through 1999 declined about 0.1319 with every 
1% increase in wages paid to mining and manufacturing workers. The median 
percentage increase in wages, 4.6%, therefore implies a decrease of 0.6% in the 
odds of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The discovered effect supports the notion that increases in wealth 
have contributed to decreasing mortality among the very old over the last 
century and a half. The findings imply that theories focusing entirely on the 
young cannot fully account for increased life expectancy in populations with 
growing fractions of the elderly.
