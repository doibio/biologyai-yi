bictegravir are similar, both including CYP3A and UGT1A1, and both agents are 
substrates to different drug transporters. Because of their differences in 
metabolism, INSTIs interact with other medications differently through CYP 
enzymes and transporters as inducers or inhibitors. These drug interactions may 
become an important consideration in the long-term clinical use because the life 
expectancy of people with HIV (PWH) approaches to that of the general 
population. Also, common geriatric challenges such as multimorbidity and 
polypharmacy have been increasingly recognized in PWH. This review provides a 
summary of pharmacokinetic interactions with INSTIs and future perspectives in 
implications of INSTI drug interactions.

BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a common disease in reproductive-age women and it 
is estimated to occur in up to 50% of those with infertility. Intestinal 
involvement is reported in up to a third of the cases. This condition is related 
to chronic pain and loss of quality of life, resulting in emotional, social and 
economic costs. Treatment consists of hormonal block and surgical resection, 
with variable side effects and efficacy. The best choice for surgical treatment 
for rectal endometriosis is a matter of discussion regarding the indication and 
the best technique to be employed.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize data on indications, results and complications of 
surgical techniques for the treatment of rectal endometriosis.
METHODS: This comprehensive systematic review is a compilation of the available 
literature and discussion, carried out by a team with experience in the surgical 
treatment of intestinal endometriosis. Data regarding indications, results and 
complications of conservative and radical techniques for the surgical treatment 
of rectal endometriosis was carefully reviewed. Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and 
CENTRAL up to May 2021 were performed to identify randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) and observational studies that compared at least two of the three 
surgical techniques of interest (i.e., shaving, discoid resection, segmental 
resection).
RESULTS: One RCT and nine case series studies with a total of 3,327 patients met 
the eligibility criteria. Participants ages ranged from a mean of 30.0 to 37.9 
years old. Mean follow-up ranged from 1.2 to 42.76 months. With regards the 
methodological quality, overall the included studies presented a low risk of 
bias in the majority of the domains. Surgical treatment of rectal endometriosis 
is indicated for patients with obstructive symptoms and those with pain scores 
above 7/10. Patients with disease involving beyond muscularis propria of the 
rectum, documented in magnetic resonance imaging or transvaginal pelvic 
ultrasound with intestinal preparation, are candidates for discoid or segmental 
resection. The presence of multifocal disease, extension greater than 3 cm and 
infiltration greater than 50% of the loop circumference favor the radical 
technique. The distance from the lesion to the anal verge, age, symptoms and 
reproductive desire are other factors that influence the choice of the technique 
to be employed. The risk of complications and unfavorable functional results 
seems to be directly related to the complexity of the procedure.
CONCLUSION: The choice of surgical technique performed for the treatment of 
rectal endometriosis is a matter of discussion and depends not only on the 
preoperative staging, but also on the patient's expectations, risks and 
potential complications, recurrence rates and the expertise of the 
multidisciplinary team.

The global distribution and temporal trend of age-related hearing loss (ARHL) 
are unknown, and we aimed to investigate magnitudes and temporal trends of ARHL 
burden and its influencing factors at the national, regional, and global levels. 
Based on the information of Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, we calculated 
the estimated annual percentage change to quantify the global, regional, and 
national temporal trends of age-standardized rates (ASRs) of ARHL by gender, 
age, and severity. The number of prevalent cases and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) of ARHL increased from 751.50 million and 22.01 million in 1990 to 
1456.66 million and 40.24 million in 2019, respectively. Except for a few 
countries such as Niger and Burkina Faso, the age-standardized prevalence rate 
and age-standardized DALYs rate showed a downward trend in most countries and 
regions. Mild ARHL accounted for the largest proportion in all ARHL, and only 
mild ARHL showed an upward trend in ASRs. In most regions, the proportion of 
ARHL disease burden attributable to occupational noise showed a downward trend 
in the past 30 years. In 2019, ARHL disease burden attributable to occupational 
noise declined with the increase of socio-demographic index in countries. 
Although the ASR of ARHL in most parts of the world is declining, the absolute 
disease burden of ARHL is still heavy. Understanding the real-time disease 
burden of ARHL and its temporal trend is of great significance for formulating 
more effective preventive measures and reducing the ARHL burden.

BACKGROUND: Displaced femoral neck fractures in geriatric patients are typically 
treated with either hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty. The choice 
between hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty requires a good estimate of 
the patient's life expectancy, as the recent HEALTH trial suggests that the 
benefits of the two operations do not diverge, if at all, until the second year 
post-operatively. A systematic review was this performed to determine if there 
sufficient information in the medical literature to estimate a patient's life 
expectancy beyond two years and to identify those patient variables affecting 
survival of that duration.
METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were queried for articles 
reporting survival data for at least two years post-operatively for at least 100 
patients, age 65 or greater, treated surgically for an isolated hip fracture. A 
final set of 43 papers was created. The methods section of all selected papers 
was then reviewed to determine which variables were collected in the studies and 
the results section was reviewed to note whether an effect was reported for all 
collected variables.
RESULTS: There were 43 eligible studies with 25 unique variables identified. 
Only age, gender, comorbidities, the presence of dementia and fracture type were 
collected in a majority of studies, and within that, only age and gender were 
reported in a majority of the results. Most (15/ 25) variables were reported in 
5 or fewer of the studies.
DISCUSSION: There are important deficiencies in the literature precluding the 
evidence-based estimation of 2 year life expectancy. Because the ostensible 
advantages of total hip arthroplasty are reaped only by those who survive two 
years or more, there is a need for additional data collection, analysis and 
reporting regarding survival after geriatric hip fracture.

Polymorphisms rs4673 and rs28714259 in predicting anthracycline-mediated 
cardiotoxicity in patients with breast cancer.

[Article in English]

INTRODUCTION: Against the background of significant progress in anticancer 
therapy, which makes it possible to improve the quality of life and life 
expectancy of patients with cancer, anthracycline antibio-tics retain their 
relevance, both for scientific research and for clinical practice. However, the 
therapeutic efficacy of anthracyclines is associated with the development of 
various complications, among which the most common is cardiotoxicity. Our study 
was dedicated to searching for possible associations between rs4673 and 
rs28714259 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of cardiotoxicity 
in breast cancer patients who underwent anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 256 patients with a dia-gnosis of 
breast cancer without dia-gnosed cardiovascular changes who were treated at the 
National Medical Research Center of Oncology in Rostov-on-Don in 2019-2020. For 
SNP genotyping, DNA was extracted from blood and high resolution melting 
analysis was performed. The presence of SNPs was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: The presence of the T-allele rs4673 increased the risk of 
cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients 6.49x (95% CI 1.48-28.53; P = 0.002), 
and the presence of the A-allele rs28714259 increased the risk 3.27x (95% CI 
1.23-8.75; P = 0.026). For tests based on genotyping rs4673 and rs28714259 SNPs, 
the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were equal to 
71.9% and 76.3%, respectively. The two-locus SNP-SNP model turned out to be 
statistically significant: the training balanced accuracy was 0.77; similarly, 
the testing balanced accuracy, and the cross-validation consistency was 10/10.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the predictive value of genetic tests based on 
the determination of the rs4673 and rs28714259 SNPs. Genotyping of both SNPs 
will significantly improve the accuracy of predicting the development of 
cardiotoxicity against the background of anthracycline-containing therapy and 
timely identify the risk group of breast cancer patients for whom it is 
necessary to adjust the therapeutic strategy.

BACKGROUND: Structural uncertainty can affect model-based economic simulation 
estimates and study conclusions. Unfortunately, unlike parameter uncertainty, 
relatively little is known about its magnitude of impact on life-years (LYs) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in modeling of diabetes. We leveraged the 
Mount Hood Diabetes Challenge Network, a biennial conference attended by 
international diabetes modeling groups, to assess structural uncertainty in 
simulating QALYs in type 2 diabetes simulation models.
METHODS: Eleven type 2 diabetes simulation modeling groups participated in the 
9th Mount Hood Diabetes Challenge. Modeling groups simulated 5 diabetes-related 
intervention profiles using predefined baseline characteristics and a standard 
utility value set for diabetes-related complications. LYs and QALYs were 
reported. Simulations were repeated using lower and upper limits of the 95% 
confidence intervals of utility inputs. Changes in LYs and QALYs from tested 
interventions were compared across models. Additional analyses were conducted 
postchallenge to investigate drivers of cross-model differences.
RESULTS: Substantial cross-model variability in incremental LYs and QALYs was 
observed, particularly for HbA1c and body mass index (BMI) intervention 
profiles. For a 0.5%-point permanent HbA1c reduction, LY gains ranged from 0.050 
to 0.750. For a 1-unit permanent BMI reduction, incremental QALYs varied from a 
small decrease in QALYs (-0.024) to an increase of 0.203. Changes in utility 
values of health states had a much smaller impact (to the hundredth of a decimal 
place) on incremental QALYs. Microsimulation models were found to generate a 
mean of 3.41 more LYs than cohort simulation models (P = 0.049).
CONCLUSIONS: Variations in utility values contribute to a lesser extent than 
uncertainty captured as structural uncertainty. These findings reinforce the 
importance of assessing structural uncertainty thoroughly because the choice of 
model (or models) can influence study results, which can serve as evidence for 
resource allocation decisions.HighlightsThe findings indicate substantial 
cross-model variability in QALY predictions for a standardized set of simulation 
scenarios and is considerably larger than within model variability to 
alternative health state utility values (e.g., lower and upper limits of the 95% 
confidence intervals of utility inputs).There is a need to understand and assess 
structural uncertainty, as the choice of model to inform resource allocation 
decisions can matter more than the choice of health state utility values.

PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to project the long-term net health benefits 
of mavacamten for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (HCM) in the United States.
METHODS: A Markov model with 4 mutually exclusive health states (New York Heart 
Association [NYHA] functional classes I, II, and III/IV and death) was developed 
to project the life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over a 
lifetime horizon for patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM receiving 
mavacamten with or without β-blocker (BB) or calcium channel blocker (CCB) 
monotherapy or placebo with or without BB or CCB monotherapy. The model 
simulated a patient cohort with a starting age of 59 years and 41% women. 
Transition probabilities across NYHA functional classes were estimated using 
data from the Phase III Clinical Study to Evaluate Mavacamten (MYK-461) in 
Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (EXPLORER-HCM) 
and the EXPLORER long-term extension (EXPLORER-LTE) cohort from the Long-term 
Safety Extension Study of Mavacamten in Adults who Have Completed MAVERICK-HCM 
or EXPLORER-HCM (MAVA-LTE) trial and were extrapolated after week 30. The 
mortality risks of NYHA functional class I were assumed to be the age- and 
sex-specific mortality risks of the US general population. The mortality risks 
for NYHA class II and III/IV were estimated using those for class I in 
conjunction with the relative mortality risks derived using patients with 
obstructive HCM from a large real-world registry. Health state utilities for 
each treatment were estimated from EXPLORER-HCM. Both LYs and QALYs were 
aggregated over a lifetime for each treatment arm, discounted at 3% annually, 
and compared between the 2 arms. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate 
the robustness of the model findings.
FINDINGS: Over a lifetime, treatment with mavacamten with or without BB or CCB 
monotherapy was associated with 3.67 incremental LYs compared with placebo with 
or without BB or CCB monotherapy (13.00 vs 9.33 LYs). Compared with individuals 
in the placebo group, patients in the mavacamten group were projected to spend 
6.17 additional LYs in NYHA functional class I and 0.04 and 2.46 fewer LYs in 
NYHA functional classes II and III/IV, respectively. With utilities 
incorporated, mavacamten with or without BB or CCB monotherapy was associated 
with 4.17 additional QALYs compared with placebo with or without BB or CCB 
monotherapy (11.74 vs 7.57 QALYs). In the sensitivity analyses, incremental 
benefits ranged from 1.55 to 6.21 LYs and from 2.48 to 6.19 QALYs across the 
scenarios.
IMPLICATIONS: This model projected substantial net health benefits associated 
with mavacamten for symptomatic obstructive HCM owing to improved patient 
survival and quality of life. The projected QALY gain underscored the likely 
long-term clinical value of mavacamten in symptomatic obstructive HCM.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive update 
of the descriptive epidemiology and trends of ischemic stroke has been released 
since Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017. Thus, our objective was to examine 
ischemic stroke burden at the global, regional, and national levels in terms of 
sex, age, and social development index (SDI).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the GBD 2019 datasets. Estimated annual 
percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to assess the incidence rate, 
mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) trends of ischemic stroke. 
Measures were stratified by sex, region, country, age, and SDI.
RESULTS: The global age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of ischemic stroke 
decreased from 1990 to 2019, with an EAPC of -0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
-0.54 to -0.32). High-middle and middle SDI regions had much higher ASIR, 
age-standardized death rate (ASDR), and age-standardized DALY rates due to 
ischemic stroke than other SDI regions. Regionally, East Asia had the highest 
ASIR of ischemic stroke in 2019 and the largest increase in the ASIR from 1990 
to 2019. Nationally, Egypt (EAPC 1.40, 95% CI 1.27-1.52) and China (EAPC 1.10, 
95% CI 1.00-1.20) had the most pronounced increases in the ASIR of ischemic 
stroke. Globally, there was an increase in ischemic stroke incidence with 
increasing age, especially in women 50 to 69 years of age or older. The global 
ASDR decreased from 1990 to 2019, with an EAPC of -1.63 (95% CI -1.72 to -1.53). 
The ASDR and age-standardized DALY rates increased most in southern sub-Saharan 
Africa, eastern sub-Saharan Africa, and southeast Asia.
DISCUSSION: The ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardized DALY rates remained high in 
high-middle and middle SDI regions. East Asia, southern sub-Saharan Africa, 
eastern sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia had the greatest burden of 
ischemic stroke.

Signaling Through MCHR1.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy 
and excessive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. To this day, no 
effective treatments to prevent the progression of fibrosis exist, and SSc 
patients have disabilities and reduced life expectancy. The need to better 
understand pathways that drive SSc and to find therapeutic targets is urgent. 
RNA sequencing data from SSc dermal fibroblasts suggested that 
melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), one of the G protein-coupled 
receptors regulating emotion and energy metabolism, is abnormally deregulated in 
SSc. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB stimulation upregulated MCHR1 mRNA 
and protein levels in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), and MCHR1 
silencing prevented the PDGF-BB-induced expression of the profibrotic factors 
transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) and connective tissue growth factor 
(CTGF). PDGF-BB bound MCHR1 in membrane fractions of NHDF, and the binding was 
confirmed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). MCHR1 inhibition blocked 
PDGF-BB modulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). MCHR1 
silencing in NHDF reduced PDGF-BB signaling. In summary, MCHR1 promoted the 
fibrotic response in NHDF through modulation of TGFβ1 and CTGF production, 
intracellular cAMP levels, and PDGF-BB-induced signaling pathways, suggesting 
that MCHR1 plays an important role in mediating the response to PDGF-BB and in 
the pathogenesis of SSc. Inhibition of MCHR1 should be considered as a novel 
therapeutic strategy in SSc-associated fibrosis.

BACKGROUND: Todays, human lifestyle has faced significant changes, and this 
lifestyle has caused health problems. The increase of smoking, among young 
people, is one of the risk factors and incorrect lifestyle factors. The present 
study will design an educational campaign intervention based on the protection 
motivation theory (PMT) on smoking preventive behaviors in students.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In designing this study, five phases are considered. (1) 
needs assessment and determination of the current situation are considered. In 
this phase, the required communication is established to form a planning team 
with key and influential people and experts, (2) tool design, (3) educational 
intervention (educational campaign) is designed. Some individuals will be 
selected and trained as facilitators to start entering the target population, 
have a better access to the target group, and implement the interventions in the 
target group. (4) the implementation of the educational plan, in which the 
designed educational intervention (educational campaign) will be implemented on 
the students of the studied universities. (5) the educational evaluation, which 
will be conducted 2 months after the intervention of the educational campaign. 
The posttest will be based on before and after the implementation of the 
educational campaign. In the prevention of the second type in smoking students, 
the salivary cotinine levels of smoking students will be measured and 
comparisons will be made before and after educational using appropriate 
statistical tests.
RESULTS: The present study addresses the needs and strategies for smoking 
prevention using a training campaign based on the PMT and web .
CONCLUSION: Designing a campaign which will lead to smoking preventive behaviors 
causes lifestyle changes, prevent health problems such as cancer, cardiovascular 
diseases, and other chronic diseases, reduce treatment costs, and increase life 
expectancy.

PURPOSE: The aim was to investigate the cross-sectional association of dietary 
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) intake with 
multiple physical functions, muscle mass and fat mass in older women.
METHOD: Study subjects were 554 women from the Osteoporosis Risk Factor and 
Prevention Fracture Prevention Study, with dietary intake assessed with 3-day 
food record. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. 
Physical function measures included walking speed 10 m, chair rises, one leg 
stance, knee extension, handgrip strength and squat. Short physical performance 
battery (SPPB) score was defined based on the European working group on 
sarcopenia criteria.
RESULTS: The multivariable adjusted models showed statistically significant 
associations for dietary ALA with higher SPPB (β = 0.118, P = 0.024), knee 
extension force at baseline (β = 0.075, P = 0.037) and lower fat mass 
(β = - 0.081, P = 0.034), as well as longer one-leg stance (β = 0.119, 
P = 0.010), higher walking speed (β = 0.113, P = 0.047), and ability to squat to 
the ground (β = 0.110, P = 0.027) at baseline. Total dietary omega-3 PUFA was 
associated with better SPPB (β = 0.108, P = 0.039), one-leg stance (β = 0.102, 
P = 0.041) and ability to squat (β = 0.110, P = 0.028), and with walking speed 
(β = 0.110, P = 0.028). However, associations for dietary EPA and DHA with 
physical function and body composition were not significant.
CONCLUSION: Dietary omega-3 and ALA, but not EPA and DHA, were positively 
associated with muscle strength and function in older women. The intake of 
omega-3 and its subtypes was not associated with muscle mass. Longitudinal 
studies are needed to show whether omega-3 intake may be important for muscle 
function in older women.

BACKGROUND: Deprescribing can reduce the use of inappropriate or unnecessary 
medication; however, the economic value of such interventions is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to identify and synthetise the economic evidence of 
deprescribing interventions among community-dwelling older adults.
METHODS: Full economic evaluation studies of deprescribing interventions, 
conducted in the community or primary care settings, in community-dwelling 
adults aged ≥ 65 years were systematically reviewed. MEDLINE, EconLit, Scopus, 
Web of Science, CEA-TUFTS, CRD York and Google Scholar databases were searched 
from inception to February 2021. Two researchers independently screened all 
retrieved articles according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main 
outcome was the economic impact of the intervention from any perspective, 
converted into 2019 US Dollars. The World Health Organization threshold of 1 
gross domestic product per capita was used to define cost effectiveness. Studies 
were appraised for methodological quality using the extended Consensus on Health 
Economics Criteria checklist.
RESULTS: Of 6154 articles identified by the search strategy, 14 papers assessing 
13 different interventions were included. Most deprescribing interventions 
included some type of medication review with or without a supportive educational 
component (n = 11, 85%), and in general were delivered within a 
pharmacist-physician care collaboration. Settings included community pharmacies, 
primary care/outpatient clinics and patients' homes. All economic evaluations 
were conducted within a time horizon varying from 2 to 12 months with outcomes 
in most of the studies derived from a single clinical trial. Main health 
outcomes were reported in terms of quality-adjusted life-years, prevented number 
of falls and the medication appropriateness index. Cost effectiveness ranged 
from dominant to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $112,932 per 
quality-adjusted life-year, a value above the country's World Health 
Organization threshold. Overall, 85% of the interventions were cost saving, 
dominated usual care or were cost effective considering 1 gross domestic product 
per capita. Nine studies scored > 80% (good) and two scored ≤ 50% (low) on 
critical quality appraisal.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a growing interest in economic evaluations of 
deprescribing interventions focused on community-dwelling older adults. Although 
results varied across setting, time horizon and intervention, most were cost 
effective according to the World Health Organization threshold. Deprescribing 
interventions are promising from an economic viewpoint, but more studies are 
needed.

This longitudinal person-centered study aimed to identify profiles of subjective 
task values and ability self-concepts of adolescents in the domain of 
mathematics, English, biology, and physics in Grades 10 and 12. We were 
interested in gendered changes of profile membership, and in relations between 
profile membership and educational and occupational outcomes in adulthood. Data 
were drawn from the Michigan Study of Adolescent and Adult Life Transitions. We 
focused on students who participated in the data collection in Grades 10 and 12 
(N = 911; 56.1% female; Mage = 16.49, SD = .63; 91.2% European American, 4.6% 
African American, and 2.1% other ethnic groups such as Hispanic, Asian, Native 
American). Data on subsequent college majors were assessed 2, 6, and 10 years 
after finishing high school and data on occupational outcomes was assessed up to 
22 years after high school. Using Latent Profile Analyses, our findings revealed 
five profiles in grade 10 and four profiles in grade 12, which were meaningfully 
related to student gender. Latent Transition Analyses showed that motivational 
beliefs became more hierarchical over time. Gendered changes in profile 
membership occurred, with boys experiencing a process of specialization into 
mathematics domains. We were also able to show that gender-specific 
intraindividual hierarchies of motivational beliefs were related to 
gender-specific specialization processes in adolescence and to subsequent 
gendered choices throughout the life course. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021

Recent studies have suggested that resting-state brain functional connectivity 
(RSFC) has the potential to discriminate among individuals in a population. 
These studies mostly utilized a pattern of RSFC obtained from one scan to 
identify a given individual from the set of patterns obtained from the second 
scan. However, it remains unclear whether the discriminative ability would 
change with the extension of the time span between the two brain scans. This 
study explores the variations in the discriminative ability of RSFC on eight 
time spans, including 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 1 month, 3-6 months, 
7-12 months, 1-2 years and 2-3 years. We first searched for a set of the most 
discriminative RSFCs using the data of 200 healthy adult subjects from the Human 
Connectome Project dataset, and we then utilized this set of RSFCs to identify 
individuals from a population. The variations in the discriminative accuracies 
over different time spans were evaluated on datasets from a total of 682 unseen 
adult subjects acquired from four different sites. We found that although the 
accuracies were detectable at above-chance levels, the discriminative accuracies 
showed a significant decrease (F = 17.87, p < 0.01) along with the extension of 
brain imaging time span, from over 90% within one month to 66% at 2-3 years. 
Furthermore, the decreasing trend was robust and not dependent on the training 
set or analysis method. Therefore, we suggest that the discriminative ability of 
RSFC in identifying individuals should be susceptible to the length of time 
between brain scans.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a leading cause of maternal 
mortality, yet diagnosis remains challenging. International diagnostic 
guidelines vary significantly in their recommendations, making it difficult to 
determine an optimal policy for evaluation.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Which societal-level diagnostic guidelines for evaluation of 
suspected PE in pregnancy are an optimal policy in terms of its 
cost-effectiveness?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We constructed a complex Markov decision model to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each identified societal guidelines for 
diagnosis of PE in pregnancy. Our model accounted for risk stratification, 
empiric treatment, diagnostic testing strategies, as well as short- and 
long-term effects from PE, treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin, and 
radiation exposure from advanced imaging. We considered clinical and cost 
outcomes of each guideline from a US health care system perspective with a 
lifetime horizon. Clinical effectiveness and costs were measured in 
time-discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and US dollars, 
respectively. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. One-way, 
multiway, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: We identified six international societal-level guidelines. Base-case 
analysis showed the guideline proposed by the American Thoracic Society and 
Society of Thoracic Radiology (ATS-STR) yielded the highest health benefits 
(22.90 QALYs) and was cost-effective, with an ICER of $7,808 over the guidelines 
proposed by the Australian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis and the Society 
of Obstetric Medicine of Australia and New Zealand (ASTH-SOMANZ). All remaining 
guidelines were dominated. The ATS-STR guideline-recommended strategy yielded an 
expected additional 2.7 QALYs/100 patients evaluated over the ASTH-SOMANZ. 
Conclusions were robust to sensitivity analyses, with the ATS-STR guidelines 
optimal in 86% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis scenarios.
INTERPRETATION: The ATS-STR guidelines for diagnosis of suspected PE in 
pregnancy are cost-effective and generate better expected health outcomes than 
guidelines proposed by other medical societies.

Ionic liquids (ILs)-resistant cellulase enzymes can facilitate the 
saccharification of IL- pretreated biomass in a one-pot wash-free method. Using 
a bioinformatics approach, two cellulases, Persicel7 and Persicel8, with 
convincing evidence for ionic liquid tolerance were identified. Subsequently, 
these enzymes were heterologously expressed and biochemically characterized. 
Persicel7 and Persicel8 exhibited endo-β-1, 4-glucanase activity and were 
resistant to inhibitors and several organic solvents. Their activity in 10% 
(v/v) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium 
chloride were 130% higher compared with IL-free control. The half-life of 
cellulases was improved up to 11-fold when incubated with 20% (v/v) solution of 
ion liquids. In addition, a one-pot IL-pretreatment and enzymatic 
saccharification of rice straw enhanced the saccharification rate by 33% 
compared to the untreated reaction. The Persicel7 and Persicel8 unique 
properties make them attractive candidates for industrial applications, 
particularly hydrolyzing ion liquid activated biomass in a one-pot system.

BACKGROUND: Discoloration of teeth occurs for various reasons. Common 
ingredients like substances from tea and coffee, as well as antibiotics like 
tetracycline, or food dyes, can percolate into the teeth, and, as such, these 
stains may persist in the porous structure of the enamel. Smoking is also 
contributory to dental discoloration, with toxins of tobacco smoke accumulating 
in a similar way. With aging, teeth tend to be discolored with accumulation of 
various stains in addition to the enamel gradually eroding to expose the yellow 
dentin.
HIGHLIGHT: This review focused on the effect of several natural ingredients with 
teeth-whitening properties and their daily clinical application. Metabolic 
dental bleaching mechanisms, as well as tooth discoloration and decay, were also 
reviewed. The current scientific literature (mostly from 2000 to 2020) was 
consolidated from manuscripts retrieved from Scopus, PubMed, ResearchGate, and 
Google Scholar.
CONCLUSION: Natural teeth whitening effectively lightens the natural color of 
teeth without eroding dental surfaces. On the other hand, commercially available 
whiteners containing hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide, in high 
concentrations, can lead to deproteinization and demineralization of teeth 
through oxidation processes. If used extensively, these compounds may cause a 
number of adverse effects. Alternative natural teeth-whiteners include 
ingredients like lemons, strawberries, oranges, papaya, and other fruits. Such 
natural ingredients offer a milder and safer way of whitening teeth than 
whiteners containing hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide.

BACKGROUND: Many studies demonstrate that being burned has both physical and 
psychological sequelae that affect quality of life. Further, these effects may 
be more prevalent in some regions and populations. We sought to access the 
unbalanced distributions and temporal trends concerning the health burden of 
thermal burns.
METHODS: Data were collected from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, and 
the disability-adjusted life year (DALY)1 was used as a measure of health 
burden. Linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between the 
age-standardized DALY rate and socio-demographic index.2 Joinpoint regression 
analysis and comparison line charts were all applied to assess the temporal 
trends of burns.
RESULTS: The age-standardized DALY rate of global thermal burns decreased by 
43.7%, from 197 (95% CI: 152-228) per 100,000 in 1990 to 111 (95% CI: 93-129) 
per 100,000 in 2017. The burden was borne mainly by children 1-4 years of age 
and people over 80 years. Socio-demographic index was negatively correlated with 
the age-standardized DALY rate. In low-middle and low socio-demographic index 
regions, the decreasing trends were slower than other regions with an average 
annual percentage change of -2.1% (95% CI: -2.2 to -2.0) and -2.1% (95% CI: -2.1 
to -2.0), respectively. Among six geographical regions, Africa presented the 
highest age-standardized DALY rates of 352 (95% CI: 275-410) per 100,000 in 1990 
and 208 (95% CI: 175-236) per 100,000 in 2017, and also the slowest average 
decreasing trend, with an average annual percentage change of -1.9% (95% CI: -2 
to -1.8).
CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of thermal burns shows a downward trend from 1990 
to 2017, and regions with lower socio-demographic index and Africa show greater 
burdens and smaller downward trends.
