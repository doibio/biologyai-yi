Aging is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death. 
Here we show that oral supplementation of the natural polyamine spermidine 
extends the lifespan of mice and exerts cardioprotective effects, reducing 
cardiac hypertrophy and preserving diastolic function in old mice. Spermidine 
feeding enhanced cardiac autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial respiration, and 
it also improved the mechano-elastical properties of cardiomyocytes in vivo, 
coinciding with increased titin phosphorylation and suppressed subclinical 
inflammation. Spermidine feeding failed to provide cardioprotection in mice that 
lack the autophagy-related protein Atg5 in cardiomyocytes. In Dahl 
salt-sensitive rats that were fed a high-salt diet, a model for 
hypertension-induced congestive heart failure, spermidine feeding reduced 
systemic blood pressure, increased titin phosphorylation and prevented cardiac 
hypertrophy and a decline in diastolic function, thus delaying the progression 
to heart failure. In humans, high levels of dietary spermidine, as assessed from 
food questionnaires, correlated with reduced blood pressure and a lower 
incidence of cardiovascular disease. Our results suggest a new and feasible 
strategy for protection against cardiovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is diagnosed when two out 
of the three primary MEN1-associated endocrine tumors occur in a patient. Up to 
10-30 % of those patients have no mutation in the MEN1 gene. It is unclear if 
the phenotype and course of the disease of mutation-negative patients is 
comparable with mutation-positive patients and if these patients have true MEN1. 
The present study aims to describe and compare the clinical course of MEN1 
mutation-negative patients with two out of the three main MEN1 manifestations 
and mutation-positive patients during long-term follow-up.
METHODS: This is a cohort study performed using the Dutch MEN1 database, 
including > 90 % of the Dutch MEN1 population.
RESULTS: A total of 293 (90.7 %) mutation-positive and 30 (9.3 %) 
mutation-negative MEN1 patients were included. Median age of developing the 
first main MEN1 manifestation was higher in mutation-negative patients (46 vs. 
33 years) (P = 0.007). Mutation-negative patients did not develop a third main 
MEN1 manifestation in the course of follow-up compared to 48.3 % of 
mutation-positive patients (P < 0.001). Median survival in mutation-positive 
patients was estimated at 73.0 years (95 % CI, 69.5-76.5) compared to 87.0 years 
(95 % CI not available) in mutation-negative patients (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mutation-positive and mutation-negative MEN1 patients have a 
different phenotype and clinical course. Mutation-negative patients develop MEN1 
manifestations at higher age and have a life expectancy comparable with the 
general population. The apparent differences in clinical course suggest that 
MEN1 mutation-negative patients do not have true MEN1, but another MEN1-like 
syndrome or sporadic co-incidence of two neuro-endocrine tumors.

AIM: To analyze the effect of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with metastatic 
spinal cord compression (MSCC) and poor prognosis in our center.
BACKGROUND: RT is an effective treatment for MSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective evaluation on patients with MSCC and limited 
survival (according to Rades' scale), and treated with single-dose 8 Gy RT 
(February 2013-August 2014). Pain, ambulatory status and sphincter control were 
recorded. Pain relief was evaluated following the International Bone Metastases 
Consensus Working Party Guidelines. Ambulatory status was evaluated with 
Frankel's scale. Spinal fracture and instability were recorded. Health aspects 
were evaluated via a short survey and measuring the time spent on RT.
RESULTS: 35 patients were included. 51% had unfavorable histologies; 60% bone 
fracture and 17% spinal instability. Median Karnofsky score was 60; 100% were on 
high doses of opioids. Median survival was 1.5 months. 49% had a partial pain 
response at 2 weeks post-radiation, and 47% at one month. Significant reductions 
in pain intensity were present at 2 weeks (Visual analog scale, VAS score, from 
8 ± 1.5 to 5 ± 1.9). Negligible effects were observed on motor and bladder 
function, along with side effects. KPS score was maintained during follow-up. 
80% of patients spent ≤5% of their remaining lifetime on RT. A survey comparison 
between clinical judgment and the results according to treatment decision 
consider that these patients merit treatment evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: A moderate pain response tailored to life expectancy can be 
obtained in patients treated with radiation. 8-Gy single-dose is an option for 
patients with limited survival.

This study examines the relationship between minimum wages and several measures 
of population health by analyzing data from 24 OECD countries for a time period 
of 31 years. Specifically, I test for health effects as a result of 
within-country variations in the generosity of minimum wages, which are measured 
by the Kaitz index. The paper finds that higher levels of minimum wages are 
associated with significant reductions of overall mortality rates as well as in 
the number of deaths due to outcomes that have been shown to be more prevalent 
among individuals with low socioeconomic status (e.g., diabetes, disease of the 
circulatory system, stroke). A 10% point increase of the Kaitz index is 
associated with significant declines in death rates and an increase in life 
expectancy of 0.44 years. Furthermore, I provide evidence for potential channels 
through which minimum wages impact population health by showing that more 
generous minimum wages impact outcomes such as poverty, the share of the 
population with unmet medical needs, the number of doctor consultations, tobacco 
consumption, calorie intake, and the likelihood of people being overweight.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Systematic reviews and economic modelling of clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therapeutic monitoring of tumour 
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors [using LISA-TRACKER® enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Theradiag, Marne La Vallee, France, or Alpha 
Laboratories, Heriot, UK), TNF-α-Blocker ELISA kits (Immundiagnostik AG, 
Bensheim, Germany) and Promonitor® ELISA kits (Proteomika, Progenika Biopharma, 
Bizkaia, Spain)] versus standard care for Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: Multiple electronic databases were searched from inception to December 
2014 in order to identify primary studies and meta-analyses.
POPULATION: Patients with moderate to severe active CD treated with infliximab 
(IFX) (Remicade®, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) or adalimumab 
(ADA) (Humira®, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA).
INTERVENTION: Monitoring of serum anti-TNF-α (IFX or ADA) and/or of anti-drug 
antibody levels using test assays with a test-treatment algorithm.
COMPARATOR: Standard care.
OUTCOMES: Any patient-related outcome, test agreement and cost-effectiveness 
estimates. The quality assessments used recognised checklists (Quality 
Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2, Cochrane, Philips and Consolidated 
Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards). Evidence was synthesised using 
narrative review and meta-analysis. A Markov model was built in TreeAge Pro 2013 
(TreeAge Software, Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA). The model had a 4-week cycle 
and a 10-year time horizon, adopted a NHS and Personal Social Services 
perspective and used a linked evidence approach. Costs were adjusted to 2013/14 
prices and discounted at 3.5%.
RESULTS: We included 68 out of 2434 and 4 out of 2466 studies for the clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness reviews, respectively. Twenty-three studies 
comparing test methods were identified. Evidence on test concordance was sparse 
and contradictory, offering scant data for a linked evidence approach. Three 
studies [two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one retrospective 
observational study] investigated outcomes following implementation of a test 
algorithm. None used the specified commercial ELISA immunoassay test kits. 
Neither of the two RCTs demonstrated clinical benefit of a test-treatment 
regimen. A meta-analysis of 31 studies to estimate test accuracy for predicting 
clinical status indicated that 20-30% of test results are likely to be 
inaccurate. The four cost-effectiveness studies suggested that testing results 
in small cost reductions. In the economic analysis the base-case analysis showed 
that standard practice (no testing/therapeutic monitoring with the intervention 
tests) was more costly and more effective than testing for IFX. Sensitivity and 
scenario analyses gave similar results. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
indicated a 92% likelihood that the 'no-testing' strategy was cost-effective at 
a willingness to pay of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Rigorous systematic reviews were undertaken; however, 
the underlying evidence base was poor or lacking. There was uncertainty about a 
linked evidence approach and a lack of gold standard for assay comparison. The 
only comparative evidence available for economic evaluation was for assays other 
than the intervention assays.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that testing is not cost-effective for IFX should be 
viewed cautiously in view of the limited evidence. Clinicians should be mindful 
of variation in performance of different assays and of the absence of 
standardised approaches to patient assessment and treatment algorithms.
FUTURE WORK RECOMMENDATIONS: There is substantial variation in the underlying 
treatment pathways and uncertainty in the relative effectiveness of assay- and 
test-based treatment algorithms, which requires further investigation. There is 
very little research evidence on ADA or on drug monitoring in children with CD, 
and conclusions on cost-effectiveness could not be reached for these.

BACKGROUND: The present study describes the epidemiological status of sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs) in Iran based on the Global Burden of Disease 
study 2010 (the GBD 2010), and compares this with those of other neighboring 
countries.
METHODS: The burden of STIs from 1990 to 2010 in Iran was derived from a 
systematic study, namely the GBD 2010, which was conducted by the Institute for 
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). Using a model-based estimation, Disability 
Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were calculated on the basis of the prevalence of 
STIs. The GBD 2010 used disability weights, and a mortality rate that was 
obtained from the vital registration system of Iran. We review the results of 
the GBD 2010 estimations for STIs in Iran.
RESULTS: The trend of DALYs attributable to STIs (107.3 and 26.47 per 100,000 
people in 1990 and 2010, respectively) and deaths (1.13 and 0.12 per 100,000 
people in 1990 and 2010, respectively) decreased dramatically in Iran during the 
last two decades. The majority of individuals affected by STI DALYs were aged 1 
- 4 and 20 - 24 years.
CONCLUSION: Since the majority of DALYs attributed to STIs were observed among 
those aged 1 - 4 years and young people, the economic burden of STIs will remain 
high in Iran. Therefore, effective evidence-based planning is critical to 
allocate the essential budget for utilizing treatment and prevention approaches.

Highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has considerably increased the 
life expectancy of patients infected with HIV. Coronary artery disease is a 
leading cause of mortality in patients infected with HIV. This is primarily 
attributed to their increased survival, HAART-induced metabolic derangements, 
and to HIV itself. The pathophysiology of atherosclerosis in HIV is both 
multifactorial and complex - involving direct endothelial injury and 
dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and a significant contribution from traditional 
cardiac risk factors. The advent of HAART has since heralded a remarkable 
improvement in outcomes, but at the expense of other unforeseen issues. It is 
thus of paramount importance to swiftly recognize and manage acute coronary 
syndromes in HIV-infected patients to attenuate adverse complications, which 
should translate into improved clinical outcomes.

Serum hepcidin concentration is regulated by iron status, inflammation, 
erythropoiesis and numerous other factors, but underlying processes are 
incompletely understood. We studied the association of common and rare single 
nucleotide variants (SNVs) with serum hepcidin in one Italian study and two 
large Dutch population-based studies. We genotyped common SNVs with genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) arrays and subsequently performed imputation using the 
1000 Genomes reference panel. Cohort-specific GWAS were performed for 
log-transformed serum hepcidin, adjusted for age and gender, and results were 
combined in a fixed-effects meta-analysis (total N 6,096). Six top SNVs 
(p<5x10-6) were genotyped in 3,821 additional samples, but associations were not 
replicated. Furthermore, we meta-analyzed cohort-specific exome array 
association results of rare SNVs with serum hepcidin that were available for two 
of the three cohorts (total N 3,226), but no exome-wide significant signal 
(p<1.4x10-6) was identified. Gene-based meta-analyses revealed 19 genes that 
showed significant association with hepcidin. Our results suggest the absence of 
common SNVs and rare exonic SNVs explaining a large proportion of phenotypic 
variation in serum hepcidin. We recommend extension of our study once additional 
substantial cohorts with hepcidin measurements, GWAS and/or exome array data 
become available in order to increase power to identify variants that explain a 
smaller proportion of hepcidin variation. In addition, we encourage follow-up of 
the potentially interesting genes that resulted from the gene-based analysis of 
low-frequency and rare variants.

Can cardiovascular disease guidelines that advise treatment decisions based on 
absolute risk be improved?

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) will remain the predominant cause of 
death and a major cause of morbidity for the foreseeable future. Consequently, 
CVD prevention offers the greatest potential for the prevention of premature 
mortality and the compression of morbidity.
DISCUSSION: The 2013 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and the 
American Heart Association expand the eligibility for CVD preventive treatment 
based on the calculated 10-year CVD risk derived from the pooled cohort equation 
to all persons who have a 10-year risk of CVD of ≥7.5% as estimated by the 
pooled cohort equation. Previous analyses show that the use of a uniform 10-year 
risk threshold of 7.5% for all ages disadvantages younger individuals for whom 
preventive therapy has most to offer. Here I show that reducing the threshold to 
3% in younger adults (women aged <66 years and men aged <56 years) will 
substantially increase the number of cardiovascular events prevented at a 
similar number needed to treat to prevent one event. Importantly, this increase 
in cardiovascular event prevention will occur in individuals with greater life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Reducing the threshold 10-year risk of CVD derived from the pooled 
cohort equation for CVD preventive treatment to 3% in younger adults (women aged 
<66 years and men aged <56 years) will more effectively prevent premature 
mortality and compress morbidity to an older age.

BACKGROUND: Rotavirus infection causes considerable disease burden of acute 
gastroenteritis (AGE) hospitalization and death among children less than 5 years 
in China. Although two rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix and RotaTeq) have been 
licensed in more than 100 countries in the world, the Lanzhou Lamb rotavirus 
vaccine (LLR) is the only vaccine licensed in China. This study aims to forecast 
the potential impacts of the two international vaccines compared to domestic 
LLR.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed using a Markov simulation model. 
We compared costs at the societal aspect and health impacts with and without a 
vaccination program by LLR, Rotarix or RotaTeq. Parameters including 
demographic, epidemiological data, costs and efficacy of vaccines were obtained 
from literature review. The model incorporated the impact of vaccination on 
reduction of incidence of rotavirus infection and severity of AGE indicated by 
hospitalization, inpatient visits and deaths. Outcomes are presented in terms of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) compared to status quo.
RESULTS: In a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 infants, the two international 
vaccines showed very good cost-effectiveness, with ICER of Rotateq and Rotarix 
shifting from LLR of $1715.11/QALY and $2105.66/QALY, respectively. Rotateq and 
Rotarix had significantly decreased incidence compared to LLR, particularly 
among infants aged 6 months to 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: RotaTeq is expected to introduce in the national routine 
immunization program to reduce disease burden of rotavirus infection with 
universal coverage.

Convex hull area (CHA) and mean angle (MA) have been proposed to describe the 
behaviour of the helical axis during joint kinematics. This study investigates 
the intra- and inter-session reliability of CHA and MA during active movements 
of the cervical spine. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers (19 women) aged 23 ± 2.8 
years participated. Each volunteer was tested on two sessions. All participants 
were instructed to perform the following active movements of the cervical spine: 
rotation, flexion/extension and lateral bending, each performed to full range 
and repeated ten consecutive times. Cervical movements were registered with an 
electromagnetic tracking system. For each participant, each movement and each 
session, range of motion (ROM), CHA and MA were extracted. ROM showed high 
intra- and inter-session reliability during all cervical spine movements using 
this method. Overall, the intra- and inter-session reliability of the helical 
axis parameters varied depending on the movement direction and ranged from fair 
to almost perfect. The intra- and inter-session reliability of CHA and MA were 
almost perfect during rotation whereas the intra- and inter-session reliability 
of CHA was substantial during lateral bending and intra- and inter-session 
reliability of MA ranged from fair to substantial during flexion/extension and 
lateral bending. This is the first study to evaluate the reliability of helical 
axis measures during active movements of the cervical spine. The results show 
that CHA and MA are promising descriptors of cervical kinematics which could be 
applied in future studies to evaluate neck function in patients with cervical 
spine disorders.

Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

PURPOSE: With the increase in the average life expectancy, the elderly 
population continues to increase rapidly. However, no consensus has been reached 
on the feasibility for surgical resection due to the high morbidity and 
mortality rate after surgical treatment in elderly patients caused by aging and 
underlying diseases.
METHODS: This study was performed with patients aged 80 years and older. The 
subjects were classified into 2 groups as follows: the surgical resection group 
consisting of 61 patients, and the conservative treatment group consisting of 39 
patients suitable for curative resection.
RESULTS: Mean age and clinical stages in the conservative treatment group were 
higher than those in the surgical resection group. There was no significant 
difference in sex, location of the lesion, histological type, or underlying 
disease. The mean survival time of surgical resection group and conservative 
treatment group was respectively 52.1 ± 2.66 months and 37.1 ± 5.08 months (P < 
0.05) for clinical stage 1 disease, 41.7 ± 5.16 months and 22.4 ± 6.07 months (P 
= 0.004) for stage 2 disease, and 31.7 ± 9.37 months and 10.6 ± 1.80 months (P = 
0.049) for stage 3 disease. However, as for the extent of lymph node resection 
for the different stages, we observed no significant difference between the 2 
groups.
CONCLUSION: Surgical resection in all clinical stages, except stage 4, showed a 
higher survival rate than conservative treatment. To minimize postoperative 
surgery complications, limited lymph node dissection should also be considered.

Increased breathing resistance compromises the time course of rhythmical forearm 
movements-a pilot study.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Skeletal muscle dysfunction is a major problem among 
the co-morbidities associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
However, muscle weakness and increased fatigability are not the only limitations 
of skeletal muscle function. Motor-respiratory coordination (MRC) may occur even 
during movements at lowest workloads. MRC modifies the temporal pattern of motor 
actions, thus probably impairing motor performance and movement precision. 
Little attention has been paid to the question of whether motor functions may be 
compromised in COPD patients independent of workload and required muscle 
strength and endurance. The present pilot study was designed to investigate the 
effects of a simulated obstruction (SO) in healthy subjects on their breathing 
pattern and the timing of a rhythmical forearm movement.
METHODS: Twenty-one subjects performed flexion- extension movements with their 
right forearm at a self-chosen rate within a range between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz. After 
a control experiment with normal breathing, a plug with a narrow hole was 
inserted between face mask and pneumotachograph to simulate obstruction. 
Subjects were required to repeat the rhythmical forearm movement at the same 
rate as in the control experiment.
RESULTS: The condition of SO significantly prolonged breath duration but reduced 
tidal volume and ventilation. In addition, period duration of the forearm 
movement increased significantly under this condition while the 
movement-to-breathing frequency ratio remained almost constant. Increased 
breathing resistance was considered to cause prolonged breath duration 
accompanied by an increase in movement period duration. The constant 
near-integer ratio between movement and breathing rates indicates that the 
change in movement period duration resulted from MRC.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this pilot study demonstrate that increased 
breathing resistance may compromise motor performance even at lower workloads. 
This means that in COPD patients, not only muscle strength and endurance are 
reduced but, moreover, fine motor skills may be impaired. This aspect has 
particular importance for many everyday activities as reduced fine motor 
performance substantially contributes to a progressive inability of the patients 
to manage their daily life.

PURPOSE: To determine the relationship of Apgar scores, gestational age and 
neonatal risk mortality scores to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for 
infants at the age of 8 months treated after birth in neonatal intensive care 
unit (NICU).
METHODS: All surviving infants treated in two-third level NICUs in Rijeka, 
Croatia (from August 2013 to August 2014) were included in this prospective, 
cross-sectional study. For all neonates, the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology 
(SNAP), SNAP with Perinatal Extension (SNAP-PE) and their simplified 
modifications (SNAP II and SNAP-PE II) were calculated. At the corrected age of 
8 months, the Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (PedsQL)-infant scale-was 
completed by parents of surviving infants. Multiple regression analysis was 
performed in order to assess the value of neonatal risk mortality scores, Apgar 
scores and gestational age as possible predictors of HRQoL, measured by 
questionnaire score.
RESULTS: A strong correlation has been found between SNAP and 5-min Apgar scores 
to HRQoL. A positive correlation was also found between gestational age and 
HRQoL.
CONCLUSION: SNAP and 5-min Apgar scores are important outcome indicators, can 
aid clinicians' and parents' decision making on the benefits and burdens of 
acute medical interventions and help determine quantities of medical treatment. 
Educated medical staff, effective and efficient medical treatment and a high 
quality of care which prevent adverse events in the first minute of life should 
be a priority in efforts to improve the future quality of life.

Estadual de Campinas. Campinas, SP, Brasil.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if the happy life expectancy in older adults differs 
according to sex and functional limitations.
METHODS: Life expectancy was estimated by Chiang method, and happy life 
expectancy was estimated by Sullivan method, combining mortality data with the 
prevalence of happiness. The questions on happiness and limitations came from a 
health survey, which interviewed 1,514 non-institutionalized older adults living 
in the city of Campinas, SP, Southeastern Brazil. The happy life expectancy was 
estimated by sex, age, and functional limitations. Based on the variance and 
standard error of the happy life expectancy, we estimated 95% confidence 
intervals, which allowed us to compare the statistical differences of the number 
of happy years lived among men and women.
RESULTS: Differences by sex in happy life expectancy were significant at ages 
60, 65, and 70. In absolute terms, women live more years happily. But, in 
relative terms, older men could expect to live proportionally more years with 
happiness. Happy life expectancy decreased significantly with increasing age in 
both men and women. Among older people living without functional limitation, 
differences by sex were statistically significant in all age groups, except at 
age 80. In the group with limitations, no significant differences by sex were 
found. Significant differences between the group without and with functional 
limitations were seen in both men and women.
CONCLUSIONS: Older men could expect to live a greater proportion of their lives 
happily in comparison to same-aged women, but women show more years with 
happiness than men. Functional limitations have a significant impact on happy 
life expectancy for both sexes.

Development of Knee Osteoarthritis After Traumatic Unilateral Lower Limb 
Amputation.

INTRODUCTION: Young military Service Members with traumatic unilateral lower 
limb amputations may be at a high risk for developing knee osteoarthritis (OA). 
There is growing evidence for potential influence and predictive value of 
nonsystemic risk factors on development and progression of primary knee OA in 
older adults. Proposed factors include chronic knee pain, obesity, abnormal knee 
joint mechanics, muscle weakness, previous knee trauma, and altered physical 
activity level. However, there is limited information available regarding 
whether such nonsystemic risk factors could also be responsible for the 
increased risk of knee OA after traumatic, unilateral lower limb amputation in 
young military Service Members. The purpose of this narrative review is to 
compile and present evidence regarding prevalence of nonsystemic and potentially 
modifiable knee OA risk factors in Service Members with traumatic, unilateral 
lower limb amputation, and to identify potential strategies for intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in July 
2015 using structured search terms related to nonsystemic risk factors for knee 
OA.
RESULTS: Current collective evidence does suggest an elevated prevalence of the 
nonsystemic knee OA risk factors in young military Service Members with 
unilateral lower limb amputation. In conclusion, the present state of the 
literature supports that young military Service Members with traumatic 
unilateral lower limb amputations may be at increased risk for developing knee 
OA compared to nonamputees. Military Service Members injured at a young age have 
a long life expectancy, and thus require comprehensive rehabilitation programs 
to prevent or delay progression of knee OA. Given the lack of strong evidence, 
further clinical research is needed to determine whether early identification 
and modification of nonsystemic risk factors for knee OA could optimize 
long-term function and quality of life in young Service Members after traumatic, 
unilateral, limb amputations.

Infantile spasms (IS) are a catastrophic childhood epilepsy syndrome 
characterized by flexion-extension spasms during infancy that progress to 
chronic seizures and cognitive deficits in later life. The molecular causes of 
IS are poorly defined. Genetic screens of individuals with IS have identified 
multiple risk genes, several of which are predicted to alter β-catenin pathways. 
However, evidence linking malfunction of β-catenin pathways and IS is lacking. 
Here, we show that conditional deletion in mice of the adenomatous polyposis 
coli gene (APC cKO), the major negative regulator of β-catenin, leads to 
excessive β-catenin levels and multiple salient features of human IS. Compared 
with wild-type littermates, neonatal APC cKO mice exhibit flexion-extension 
motor spasms and abnormal high-amplitude electroencephalographic discharges. 
Additionally, the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents is increased in 
layer V pyramidal cells, the major output neurons of the cerebral cortex. At 
adult ages, APC cKOs display spontaneous electroclinical seizures. These data 
provide the first evidence that malfunctions of APC/β-catenin pathways cause 
pathophysiological changes consistent with IS. Our findings demonstrate that the 
APC cKO is a new genetic model of IS, provide novel insights into molecular and 
functional alterations that can lead to IS, and suggest novel targets for 
therapeutic intervention.

BACKGROUND: In Vietnam, a lower-middle income country, while the overall skill- 
and knowledge-based quality of health workforce is improving, health workers are 
disproportionately distributed across different economic regions. A similar 
trend appears to be in relation to health outcomes between those regions. It is 
unclear, however, whether there is any relationship between the distribution of 
health workers and the achievement of health outcomes in the context of Vietnam. 
This study examines the statistical relationship between the availability of 
health workers and health outcomes across the different economic regions in 
Vietnam.
METHODS: We constructed a panel data of six economic regions covering 8 years 
(2006-2013) and used principal components analysis regressions to estimate the 
impact of health workforce on health outcomes. The dependent variables 
representing the outcomes included life expectancy at birth, infant mortality, 
and under-five mortality rates. Besides the health workforce as our target 
explanatory variable, we also controlled for key demographic factors including 
regional income per capita, poverty rate, illiteracy rate, and population 
density.
RESULTS: The numbers of doctors, nurses, midwives, and pharmacists have been 
rising in the country over the last decade. However, there are notable 
differences across the different categories. For example, while the numbers of 
nurses increased considerably between 2006 and 2013, the number of pharmacists 
slightly decreased between 2011 and 2013. We found statistically significant 
evidence of the impact of density of doctors, nurses, midwives, and pharmacists 
on improvement to life expectancy and reduction of infant and under-five 
mortality rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Availability of different categories of health workforce can 
positively contribute to improvements in health outcomes and ultimately extend 
the life expectancy of populations. Therefore, increasing investment into more 
equitable distribution of four main categories of health workforce (doctors, 
nurses, midwives, and pharmacists) can be an important strategy for improving 
health outcomes in Vietnam and other similar contexts. Future interventions will 
also need to consider an integrated approach, building on the link between the 
health and the development.

BACKGROUND: The demographic shift and epidemiologic transition in Brazil have 
drawn attention to ways of measuring population health that complement studies 
of mortality. In this paper, we investigate regional differences in healthy life 
expectancy based on information from the National Health Survey (PNS), 2013.
METHODS: In the survey, a three-stage cluster sampling (census tracts, 
households and individuals) with stratification of the primary sampling units 
and random selection in all stages was used to select 60,202 Brazilian adults 
(18 years and over). Healthy life expectancies (HLE) were estimated by 
Sullivan's method according to sex, age and geographic region, using poor 
self-rated health for defining unhealthy status. Logistic regression models were 
used to investigate socioeconomic and regional inequalities in poor self-rated 
health, after controlling by sex and age.
RESULTS: Wide disparities by geographic region were found with the worst 
indicators in the North and Northeast regions, whether considering educational 
attainment, material deprivation, or health care utilization. Life expectancy at 
birth for women and men living in the richest regions was 5 years longer than 
for those living in the less wealthy regions. Modeling the variation across 
regions for poor self-rated health, statistically significant effects (p < 
0.001) were found for the North and Northeast when compared to the Southeast, 
even after controlling for age, sex, diagnosis of at least one non-communicable 
chronic disease, and schooling or socioeconomic class. Marked regional 
inequalities in HLE were found, with the loss of healthy life much higher among 
residents of the poorest regions, especially among the elderly.
CONCLUSIONS: By combining data on self-rated health status and mortality in a 
single indicator, Healthy Life Expectancy, this study demonstrated the excess
