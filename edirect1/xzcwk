Growing elderly populations, sometimes referred to as gray (or silver) tsunami, 
are an increasingly serious health and socioeconomic concern for modern 
societies. Science has made tremendous progress in the understanding of aging 
itself, which has helped medicine to extend life expectancies. With the increase 
of the life expectancy, the incidence of chronic age-related diseases (ARDs) has 
also increased. A new approach trying to solve this problem is the concept of 
geroscience. This concept implies that the aging process itself is the common 
cause of all ARDs. The corollary and consequence of such thinking is that we can 
and should treat aging itself as a disease. How to translate this into the 
medical practice is a big challenge, but if we consider aging as a disease the 
problem is solved. However, as there is no common definition of what aging is, 
what its causes are, why it occurs, and what should be the target(s) for 
interventions, it is impossible to conclude that aging is a disease. On the 
contrary, aging should be strongly considered not to be a disease and as such 
should not be treated; nonetheless, aging is likely amenable to optimization of 
changes/adaptations at an individual level to achieve a better functional 
healthspan.

Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO2 ) have raised environmental concerns and 
display potential hazards to aquatic organisms and even humans. However, only a 
few reports tested the toxicity of nTiO2 to rotifers. In the present study, 
acute and chronic toxicity of nTiO2 to the freshwater rotifer Brachionus 
calyciflorus was investigated at different temperatures. At 25°C, the 24 and 
48-hr LC50 was 117.14 and 60.11 mg/L, respectively. At 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, and 
30°C, exposure to nTiO2 significantly decreased life expectancy at birth, net 
reproductive rate, generation time, average lifespan, and/or intrinsic rate of 
population increase of B. calyciflorus (p < .05). High temperature enhanced the 
toxicity of nTiO2 to rotifers. The swimming linear speed of rotifers 
significantly increased (p < .05) in treatments with 200 µg/L nTiO2 , compared 
with the control. In addition, treatments with 8 µg/L to 5 mg/L nTiO2 
significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity (p < .05). Glutathione 
content and catalase activity increased significantly after exposure to 8 µg/L 
nTiO2  but decreased significantly in treatments with nTiO2 concentrations 
ranging from 40 µg/L to 5 mg/L (p < .05). There were no significant changes in 
malondialdehyde contents among nTiO2 treatments and control. Overall, the 
present study indicated that nTiO2 revealed high toxicity to rotifers, 
displaying high environmental risks to aquatic ecosystems.

Osteosarcoma(OS) represents the main cancer affecting bone tissue, and one of 
the most frequent in children. In this review we discuss the major pathological 
hallmarks of this pathology, its current therapeutics, new active biomolecules, 
as well as the nanotechnology outbreak applied to the development of innovative 
strategies for selective OS targeting. Small RNA molecules play a role as 
key-regulator molecules capable of orchestrate different responses in what 
concerns cancer initiation, proliferation, migration and invasiveness. 
Frequently associated with lung metastasis, new strategies are urgent to upgrade 
the therapeutic outcomes and the life-expectancy prospects. Hence, the prominent 
rise of micelleplexes as multifaceted and efficient structures for nucleic acid 
delivery and selective drug targeting is revisited here with special emphasis on 
ligand-mediated active targeting. Future landmarks toward the development of 
novel nanostrategies for both OS diagnosis and OS therapy improvements are also 
discussed.

Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of crizotinib verses platinum-based 
doublet chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK)-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the real-world setting. 
Methods: Data from 163 advanced ALK positive NSCLC patients were collected from 
West China Hospital, Sichuan University (Chengdu, China). They were categorized 
into two groups as treated with crizotinib (n = 83) or chemotherapy (n = 80) as 
a first-line therapy. The progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary 
clinical outcome, and the direct medical costs were collected from hospital 
information systems. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated 
with costs, quality-adjusted life-years, as well as the costs discounted at 3% 
annually. Additionally, two different kinds of medical insurance (MI) for 
pharma-economic assessment were considered. Results: Crizotinib improved PFS 
versus chemotherapy in ALK positive patients (median PFS 19.67 m vs 5.47 m; p < 
0.001). Moreover, crizotinib obtained an ICER of US$36,285.39 before the end of 
2016, when crizotinib, pemetrexed and anti-angiogenesis drugs were not MI 
covered. This is more than the willingness to pay threshold (three-times of 
gross domestic product per capita in mainland China or Sichuan Province). 
However, ICER was US$7321.16, which is less than willingness to pay, when 
crizotinib and all chemotherapy drugs were covered by MI from the end of 2016. 
Sensitivity analysis demonstrated a 99.7% probability for crizotinib to be more 
cost-effective than chemotherapy, when crizotinib and all anticancer drugs were 
MI covered. One-way sensitivity analysis for the reimbursement ratio of 
crizotinib indicated that cost-effective tendency for crizotinib increased as 
reimbursement ratio increased. Conclusion: Crizotinib could be an effective, and 
cost-effective first-line treatment for ALK positive advanced NSCLC with the MI 
coverage currently available in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.

PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to assess, by using a cost-benefit 
analysis, the net monetary benefit (NMB) of bariatric surgery compared with diet 
(including physical exercise) for obese patients, from both an Italian payer 
perspective and the broader societal perspective.
METHODS: The study considered the following groups of patients: (1) patients 
with a body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m2 without complications + patients with BMI 
≥35 kg/m2 with complications; (2) patients with BMI ≥35 kg/m2 and diabetes; and 
(3) patients with BMI ranging from 30 to 35 kg/m2 and diabetes. A Markov model 
was developed to project the lifetime health outcomes (life years and 
quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) and costs associated with bariatric surgery 
and diet for the considered groups of patients. The clinical effectiveness of 
each strategy was based on the likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular events 
or events related to the presence of diabetes. Data on clinical effectiveness, 
quality of life, productivity losses, and out-of-pocket costs were mainly 
derived from the literature; direct costs were obtained from official tariffs or 
the literature. Different scenarios were considered for the analyses in addition 
to the base case. According to both perspectives considered, the NMB was 
calculated by first assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold (30,000€ per QALY), 
then converting health benefits (QALYs) into the common monetary metric (ie, the 
euro). NMB was calculated as follows: (incremental benefit × willingness-to-pay 
- incremental cost).
FINDINGS: For all the scenarios and groups of patients considered, the NMB of 
bariatric surgery versus diet, on a lifetime horizon, from the payer perspective 
was positive and ranged from 54,647€ to 122,960€; it varied between 141,192€ and 
380,286€ from the societal perspective. In the former case, the NMB turns 
positive after 3-4 years, indicating that bariatric surgery may be a worthy 
investment also in the short run for the National Health Service; in the latter 
case, for a time horizon longer than 2-3 years, the surgical option begins to 
show advantages for the whole society.
IMPLICATIONS: Despite its defined cost-effectiveness, bariatric surgery is 
under-diffused because the initial investment for the technology is often 
considered a barrier. The cost-benefit analysis showed that bariatric surgery, 
compared with diet, may be a worthwhile technology for obese patients in Italy 
from both a payer perspective and the broader societal perspective.

INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary brain tumour, 
with the least favourable prognosis. Despite numerous studies and medical 
advances, it continues to be lethal, with an average life expectancy of 15 
months after chemo-radiotherapy.
DEVELOPMENT: Recent research has addressed several factors associated with the 
diagnosis and prognosis of glioblastoma; one significant factor is tumour 
localisation, particularly the subventricular zone, which represents one of the 
most active neurogenic niches of the adult human brain. Glioblastomas in this 
area are generally more aggressive, resulting in unfavourable prognosis and a 
shorter life expectancy. Currently, the research into microRNAs (miRNA) has 
intensified, revealing different expression patterns under physiological and 
pathophysiological conditions. It has been reported that the expression levels 
of certain miRNAs, mainly those related to neurogenic processes, are 
dysregulated in oncogenic events, thus favouring gliomagenesis and greater 
tumour aggressiveness. This review discusses some of the most important miRNAs 
involved in subventricular neurogenic processes and their association with 
glioblastoma aggressiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA regulation and function play an important role in the 
development and progression of glioblastoma; understanding the alterations of 
certain miRNAs involved in both differentiation and neural and glial maturation 
could help us to better understand the malignant characteristics of 
glioblastoma.

In 1930, the life expectancy of patients with Down syndrome was about 10 years; 
today, their life expectancy is more than 60 years. With aging, there is an 
increased need for anesthesia and surgery. There is, however, no published 
information regarding the anesthetic management of older adults with Down 
syndrome. In this report, we described the anesthetic management of a 
50-year-old woman with Down syndrome undergoing major cervical spine surgery. 
Components of the anesthetic that we thought would be difficult such as 
intravenous line placement and endotracheal intubation were accomplished without 
difficulty. Despite our best efforts, our patient nevertheless experienced both 
emergence delirium and postoperative vomiting. We advocate that physicians, 
advanced practice providers, and registered nurses be aware of the unique 
perianesthesia needs of older patients with Down syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with multiple chronic health conditions are often managed in 
a disjointed fashion in primary care, with annual review clinic appointments 
offered separately for each condition. This study aimed to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of the 3D intervention, which was developed to improve the 
system of care.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation conducted alongside a pragmatic cluster-randomised 
trial.
SETTING: General practices in three centres in England and Scotland.
PARTICIPANTS: 797 adults with three or more chronic conditions were randomised 
to the 3D intervention, while 749 participants were randomised to receive usual 
care.
INTERVENTION: The 3D approach: comprehensive 6-monthly general practitioner 
consultations, supported by medication reviews and nurse appointments.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary economic evaluation assessed 
the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from the perspective of 
the National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS). Costs were 
related to changes in a range of secondary outcomes (QALYs accrued by both 
participants and carers, and deaths) in a cost-consequences analysis from the 
perspectives of the NHS/PSS, patients/carers and productivity losses.
RESULTS: Very small increases were found in both QALYs (adjusted mean difference 
0.007 (-0.009 to 0.023)) and costs (adjusted mean difference £126 (£-739 to 
£991)) in the intervention arm compared with usual care after 15 months. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £18 499, with a 50.8% chance of being 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY (55.8% at 
£30 000 per QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: The small differences in costs and outcomes were consistent with 
chance, and the uncertainty was substantial; therefore, the evidence for the 
cost-effectiveness of the 3D approach from the NHS/PSS perspective should be 
considered equivocal.

BACKGROUND: Interventions that reduce morbidity, in addition to mortality, 
warrant prioritisation. It is important to understand the magnitude of potential 
morbidity and health gains from changing risk factor distributions. We 
quantified the impact of tobacco compared with overweight/obesity eradication on 
future morbidity and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) for the New Zealand 
population alive in 2011.
METHODS: Business-as-usual (BAU) future smoking rates were set based on past 
falling rates, but we assumed no future change in Body Mass Index (BMI) 
distribution, given historic trends. Population impact fractions and the 
percentage reduction in incidence rates for 16 tobacco-related and 14 
overweight/obesity-related diseases (allowing for time lags) were calculated 
using the difference between BAU and eradication risk factor scenarios combined 
with tobacco and BMI incidence rate ratios. We used two multistate lifetable 
models to estimate HALE changes over the remaining lifespan and morbidity rate 
changes 30 years hence.
RESULTS: HALE gains always exceeded life expectancy (LE) gains for 
overweight/obesity eradication (ie, absolute compression of morbidity), but for 
eradication of tobacco, the pattern was mixed. For example, among 32-year-olds 
in 2011, overweight/obesity eradication increased HALE by 2.06 years and LE by 
1.21 years, compared with 0.54 and 0.50 years for tobacco eradication.Morbidity 
rate reductions 30 years into the future were considerably greater for 
overweight/obesity eradication (eg, a 15.8% reduction for 72-year-olds in 2041, 
or the cohort that was aged 42 years in 2011) than for tobacco eradication 
(2.7%). The same rate of morbidity experienced at age 65 years under BAU was 
deferred by 5 years with overweight/obesity eradication.
CONCLUSIONS: Preventive programmes that reduce overweight and obesity have 
strong potential to reduce or compress morbidity, improving the average health 
status of ageing populations. This paper simulated eradication of tobacco and 
overweight/obesity; actual interventions will have lesser health impacts, but 
the relativities of morbidity to mortality gains should be similar.

Coix seed oil (CSO) has many beneficial effects, but there is limited research 
on its influence on the processes and mechanisms related to senescence. Here, we 
used Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo model to investigate CSO's bioeffects 
on longevity. CSO (1 mg/mL) significantly extended the mean lifespan of C. 
elegans by over 22.79% and markedly improved stress resistance. Gene-specific 
mutant studies showed that the CSO-mediated increase in life expectancy was 
dependent on mev-1, hsf-1 and daf-16, but not daf-2. Furthermore, CSO 
significantly upregulated stress-inducible genes, including daf-16 and its 
downstream genes (sod-3, hsp-16.2 and gst-4). In addition, four major fatty 
acids, linoleic, oleic, palmitic and stearic, played leading roles in C. 
elegans' extended lifespan. Thus, CSO increased the life expectancy of, and 
enhanced the stress resistance in, C. elegans mainly through daf-16 and its 
downstream genes, but not through the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 
signaling pathway.

[Chapitre 9. Oncofertility and prepubescent girls: A ‘right to an open 
future’?.].

[Article in French]

Affdal AO, Ravitsky V.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have increased the life expectancy of cancer 
patients but may cause premature ovarian failure and irreversible loss of 
fertility. In the context of childhood cancers, it is now acknowledged that 
possible negative effects of treatment on future reproductive autonomy are a 
major concern. While a few options are open to patients post-puberty, the only 
option currently open to prepubescent girls is cryopreservation of ovarian 
tissue and subsequent transplantation. Yet, this procedure raises ethical 
concerns related to its experimental nature and to risks involved in surgery and 
general anesthesia. In addition, the risk of malignant cells being reintroduced 
in the future following autologous transplantation of the ovarian tissue is 
still poorly evaluated. A number of ethical issues arise surrounding this 
procedure. While the girl&#8217;s future reproductive autonomy is at stake, it 
is important to also consider risks associated with the procedure. Fertility 
preservation through cryopreservation of ovarian tissue thus raises a conflict 
between the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. We argue that the 
ethical complexity surrounding fertility preservation for prepubescent girls 
should be resolved by applying the principle of &#8220;the child&#8217;s right 
to an open future&#8221;. We propose to consider &#8216;beneficence&#8217; 
through the lens of the reproductive autonomy and her potentialin becoming a 
genetic parent.

Purpose: To estimate the prevalence and associated factors of AMD in an Iranian 
population in 2014.Methods: In this population-based cross-sectional study, a 
total of 2975 Iranian residents (age: ≥50 years) from the urban and rural areas 
of Gilan province were included. The prevalence of different grades of AMD was 
determined using the International Age-Related Maculopathy Epidemiological Study 
Group grading system.Results: Of 2975 eligible individuals, 2587 (87.0%) 
subjects participated and 2275 (76.5%) subjects (62.6 ± 8.8 years old) had 
gradable fundus photographs. Age- and sex-standardized prevalence of early and 
late AMD based on the 2016 Iran census were 13.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
10.6-16.2) and 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4-1.3), respectively. In multivariate analysis, 
each decade increase in age was associated with the adjusted odds of any 
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.31, 95% CI, 1.09-1.56; P = .0031), early (AOR = 
1.27, 95% CI, 1.06-1.53; P = .012) and late AMD (AOR = 2.39, 95% CI, 1.08-5.28; 
P = .031). Hyperopia was identified to be less frequent in late AMD (AOR = 0.20, 
95% CI, 0.04-0.80; P = .024). No significant association was found between AMD 
and sex, smoking, outdoor working, diabetes, hypertension, pseudophakia, 
hyperlipidemia and myopia.Conclusion: Gilan Eye Study demonstrated the first 
estimate of age-specific AMD prevalence in Iran being compatible with other WHO 
regions. With the expected increase in the life expectancy and aging of 
Iranians, the number of people affected by AMD will be increasing in future. 
Healthcare policy makers should be advised to provide more efficient eye care 
services and preventive strategies in this regard.

IMPORTANCE: Despite substantial research, the drivers of the widening gap in 
life expectancy between rich and poor individuals in the United States-known as 
the longevity gap-remain unknown. The hypothesis of this study is that social 
mobility may play an important role in explaining the longevity gap.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether social mobility is associated with income-related 
differences in life expectancy in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, ecological study used 
data from 1559 counties in the United States to assess the association of social 
mobility with average life expectancy at age 40 years by sex and income quartile 
among adult men and women over the period of January 2000 through December 2014. 
Bayesian generalized linear multilevel regression models were used to estimate 
the association, with adjustment for a range of socioeconomic, demographic, and 
health care system characteristics.
EXPOSURES: County-level social mobility, here operationalized as the association 
of the income rank of individuals born during the period of January 1980 through 
December 1982 (based on tax record data, averaged over the period January 2010 
through December 2012) with the income ranks of their parents (averaged over the 
period January 1996 through December 2000) using the location where the parent 
first claimed the child as a dependent at age 15 years to identify counties.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was life expectancy at age 40 years 
by sex and income quartile.
RESULTS: The sample consisted of 1559 counties, which represented 93% of the US 
population in 2000. Each 1-SD increase in social mobility-equivalent to the 
difference between a low-mobility state, such as Alabama (ranked 49th on this 
measure), and a higher-mobility state, such as Massachusetts (ranked 23rd on 
this measure)-was associated with a 0.38-year (95% credible interval [CrI], 
0.29-0.47) and a 0.29-year (95% CrI, 0.21-0.38) increase in county-level life 
expectancy among men and women, respectively, in the lowest income quartile. 
Estimates for life expectancies among county residents in the highest income 
quartile were smaller in magnitude and not robust to covariate adjustment (men: 
0.10-year [95% CrI, -0.02 to 0.22] increase; women: 0.08-year [95% CrI, -0.05 to 
0.20] increase). Increasing social mobility in all counties to the value of the 
highest social mobility county was associated with decreases in the life 
expectancy gap between the highest and lowest income quartiles by 1.4 (95% CrI, 
0.7-2.1) years for men and 1.1 (95% CrI, 0.5-1.6) years for women nationally, 
representing a 20% decrease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, higher county-level 
social mobility was associated with smaller county-level gaps in life expectancy 
by income. These findings motivate further investigation of causal relationships 
between policies that shift social mobility and health outcomes.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is age-related interstitial lung disease of 
unknown etiology. About 100,000 people in the U.S have IPF, with a 3-year median 
life expectancy post-diagnosis. The development of an effective treatment for 
pulmonary fibrosis will require an improved understanding of its molecular 
pathogenesis and the "normal" and "pathological' hallmarks of the aging lung. An 
important characteristic of the aging organism is its lowered capacity to adapt 
quickly to, and counteract, disturbances. While it is likely that DNA damage, 
chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and accumulation of heat shock 
proteins are capable of initiating tissue repair, recent studies point to a 
pathogenic role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of pulmonary 
fibrosis. These studies suggest that damage to the mitochondria induces fibrotic 
remodeling through a variety of mechanisms including the activation of apoptotic 
and inflammatory pathways. Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) has been 
demonstrated to play an important role in the maintenance of mitochondrial 
homeostasis. Different factors can induce MQC, including mitochondrial DNA 
damage, proteostasis dysfunction, and mitochondrial protein translational 
inhibition. MQC constitutes a complex signaling response that affects 
mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, fusion/fission and the mitochondrial 
unfolded protein response (UPRmt) that, together, can produce new mitochondria, 
degrade the components of the oxidative complex or clearance the entire 
organelle. In pulmonary fibrosis, defects in mitophagy and mitochondrial 
biogenesis have been implicated in both cellular apoptosis and senescence during 
tissue repair. MQC has also been found to have a role in the regulation of other 
protein activity, inflammatory mediators, latent growth factors, and 
anti-fibrotic growth factors. In this review, we delineated the role of MQC in 
the pathogenesis of age-related pulmonary fibrosis.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of case manager-assisted 
rehabilitation as an add-on to usual physical rehabilitation after lumbar spinal 
fusion, given the lack of any clinical benefits found on analysing the clinical 
data.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial with 
two-year follow-up.
SETTING: Patients from the outpatient clinics of a university hospital and a 
general hospital.
SUBJECTS: A total of 82 lumbar spinal fusion patients.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized one-to-one to case manager-assisted 
rehabilitation programme as an add-on to usual physical rehabilitation or to 
usual physical rehabilitation.
MAIN MEASURES: Oswestry Disability Index and EuroQol 5-dimension. Danish 
preference weights were used to estimate quality-adjusted life years. Costs were 
estimated from micro costing and national registries. Multiple imputation was 
used to handle missing data. Costs and effects were presented with means (95% 
confidence interval (CI)). The incremental net benefit was estimated for a range 
of hypothetical values of willingness to pay per gain in effects.
RESULTS: No impact of case manager-assisted rehabilitation on the Oswestry 
Disability Index or estimate quality-adjusted life years was observed. 
Intervention cost was Euros 3984 (3468; 4499), which was outweighed by average 
reductions in inpatient resource use and sickness leave. A cost reduction of 
Euros 1716 (-16,651; 20,084) was found in the case manager group. Overall, the 
probability for the case manager-assisted rehabilitation programme being 
cost-effective did not exceed a probability of 56%, regardless of willingness to 
pay. Sensitivity analysis did not change the conclusion.
CONCLUSION: This case manager-assisted rehabilitation programme was unlikely to 
be cost-effective.

Background: Prevention and treatment of iodine deficiency-related diseases 
remain an important public health challenge. Iodine deficiency can have severe 
health consequences, such as cretinism, goiter, or other thyroid disorders, and 
it has economic implications. Our aim was to give an overview of studies 
applying decision-analytic modeling to evaluate the effectiveness and/or 
cost-effectiveness of iodine deficiency-related prevention strategies or 
treatments related to thyroid disorders. Methods: We performed a systematic 
literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval 
System Online), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database), Tuft's Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis Registry, and National Health System Economic Evaluation Database (NHS 
EED) to identify studies published between 1985 and 2018 comparing different 
prevention or treatment strategies for iodine deficiency and thyroid disorders 
by applying a mathematical decision-analytic model. Studies were required to 
evaluate patient-relevant health outcomes (e.g., remaining life years, 
quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). Results: Overall, we found 3950 studies. 
After removal of duplicates, abstract/title, and full-text screening, 17 studies 
were included. Eleven studies evaluated screening programs (mainly newborns and 
pregnant women), five studies focused on treatment approaches (Graves' disease, 
toxic thyroid adenoma), and one study was about primary prevention (consequences 
of iodine supplementation on offspring). Most of the studies were conducted 
within the U.S. health care context (n = 7). Seven studies were based on a 
Markov state-transition model, nine studies on a decision tree model, and in one 
study, an initial decision tree and a long-term Markov state-transition model 
were combined. The analytic time horizon ranged from 1 year to lifetime. QALYs 
were evaluated as health outcome measure in 15 of the included studies. In all 
studies, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. None of the models 
reported a formal model validation. In most cases, the authors of the modeling 
studies concluded that screening is potentially cost-effective or even 
cost-saving. The recommendations for treatment approaches were rather 
heterogeneous and depending on the specific research question, population, and 
setting. Conclusions: Overall, we predominantly identified decision-analytic 
modeling studies evaluating specific screening programs or treatment approaches; 
however, there was no model evaluating primary prevention programs on a 
population basis. Conclusions deriving from these studies, for example, that 
prevention is cost-saving, need to be carefully interpreted as they rely on many 
assumptions.

Body size is a trait that broadly influences the demography and ecology of 
organisms. In unitary organisms, body size tends to increase with age. In 
modular organisms, body size can either increase or decrease with age, with size 
changes being the net difference between modules added through growth and 
modules lost through partial mortality. Rates of colony extension are 
independent of body size, but net growth is allometric, suggesting a significant 
role of size-dependent mortality. In this study, we develop a generalizable 
model of partitioned growth and partial mortality and apply it to data from 11 
species of reef-building coral. We show that corals generally grow at constant 
radial increments that are size independent, and that partial mortality acts 
more strongly on small colonies. We also show a clear life-history trade-off 
between growth and partial mortality that is governed by growth form. This 
decomposition of net growth can provide mechanistic insights into the relative 
demographic effects of the intrinsic factors (e.g. acquisition of food and 
life-history strategy), which tend to affect growth, and extrinsic factors (e.g. 
physical damage, and predation), which tend to affect mortality.

Life expectancy has dramatically increased around the world over the last few 
decades, and staying healthier longer, without chronic disease, has become an 
important issue. Although understanding aging is a grand challenge, our 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the degeneration of cell and tissue 
functions with age and its contribution to chronic disease has greatly advanced 
during the past decade. As our immune system alters with aging, abnormal 
activation of immune cells leads to imbalance of innate and adaptive immunity 
and develops a persistent and mild systemic inflammation, inflammaging. With 
their unique therapeutic properties, such as immunomodulation and tissue 
regeneration, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be a 
promising source for treating autoimmune disease or as anti-aging therapy. 
Although direct evidence of the role of MSCs in inflammaging has not been 
thoroughly studied, features reported in senescent MSCs or the aging process of 
MSCs are associated with inflammaging; MSC niche-driven skewing of hematopoiesis 
toward the myeloid lineage or oncogenesis, production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, and weakening their modulative property on macrophage polarization, 
which plays a central role on inflammaging development. This review explores the 
role of senescent MSCs as an important regulator for onset and progression of 
inflammaging and as an effective target for anti-aging strategies. [BMB Reports 
2020; 53(2): 65-73].

OBJECTIVES: To explore the negative recollections of prostate cancer patients 
regarding the attitudes and language used by the doctors in delivering their 
diagnoses in Japan, in order to improve patient-centred communication.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a qualitative secondary analysis of the prostate 
cancer narrative data from the Database of Individual Patients' 
Experiences-Japan archives. A thematic analysis was conducted regarding negative 
recollections of doctors' words/attitudes when delivering a cancer diagnosis. 
Recruitment was based on maximum variation sampling. Participants were recruited 
from medical institutions, patient associations and through media 
advertisements.
PARTICIPANTS: Men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer (n=51).
FINDINGS: Of the 51 participants, 17 had negative recollections of the doctors' 
words/attitudes during the delivery of the cancer diagnosis. After thematic 
analysis, 11 categories emerged: 'Surprised by the abrupt disclosure of the 
diagnosis', 'Displeased by the direct disclosure of the diagnosis to the patient 
in the absence of family members', 'Unable to accept the doctor's negative words 
in the explanations', 'Unable to understand the doctor's technical jargon', 
'Distrust due to failure in diagnosis based on previous examinations', 
'Aggrieved at the doctor's unwillingness to allow questions', 'Dissatisfied with 
explanations involving facts only', 'Indignant over the unexpected disclosure of 
life expectancy', 'Unable to accept the doctor's blame for the delay in the 
initial hospital visit', 'Uncomfortable with the usage of inappropriate 
metaphors' and 'Pessimistic thoughts despite optimistic explanations'.
CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that patients have recollections of a variety of 
negative experiences regarding the words/attitudes of their doctors at the time 
they received their prostate cancer diagnosis. Thus, the use of narrative data 
would facilitate the appropriate application of commonly used guidelines for the 
delivery of cancer diagnoses tailored to individual patients in clinical 
practice.
