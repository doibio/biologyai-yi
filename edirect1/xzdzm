In March 2022, following the annual International Committee on Taxonomy of 
Viruses (ICTV) ratification vote on newly proposed taxa, the phylum 
Negarnaviricota was amended and emended. The phylum was expanded by two new 
families (bunyaviral Discoviridae and Tulasviridae), 41 new genera, and 98 new 
species. Three hundred forty-nine species were renamed and/or moved. The 
accidentally misspelled names of seven species were corrected. This article 
presents the updated taxonomy of Negarnaviricota as now accepted by the ICTV.

The quantification of how healthy the indoor air is, is a complex issue 
comprising of a large number of contaminants of various sources. The health 
implication of exposure to each of the contaminant deemed of importance can be 
expressed using Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). The sum of all DALYs 
indicates how harmful the indoor air was during the investigated time-frame. 
This metric was originally developed by the World Bank and the WHO. In 2012, 
Logue et. al described two methods to estimate the DALYs related to exposure to 
contaminants in the indoor air based on the yearly mean exposure concentration 
of a population. The downside of these methods is that, when detailed exposure 
concentration profiles are available the method results in a loss of 
information. A novel method was developed to estimate DALYs originating from 
exposure to indoor pollutants that can be used for time-resolved exposure 
concentration data without this loss of information: Dynamic DALYs. The 
advantage of this method is that it can be calculated in real-time and for short 
or long periods of data. As such it can be used for pin-pointing problematic 
events in the exposure profile of a person and, as it can be calculated in 
real-time, makes it a candidate for use in automated optimization problems. The 
use of Dynamic DALYs is demonstrated for a simulation case-study of an occupied 
apartment. One continuously ventilated system (Dcont) and one smart ventilation 
system (Dsmart) are compared. Sources of typically indoor generated Volatile 
Organic Compounds (VOCs) were added and the related exposure profile and Dynamic 
DALY results of the working adult were analyzed. The results showcase detailed 
and more summative results with regards to health and energy use using the novel 
indicator. For Dcont and Dsmart the total Dynamic DALYs are 2.2 years and 
8.6 years, respectively (population of 100 000, duration of 1 year), for the 
VOCs and sources considered in the analysis.

Invasive alien plants posed a significant threat to natural ecosystems, 
biodiversity, agricultural production, as well as human and livestock health. 
Lolium temulentum, an annual invasive alien weed with fibrous roots, can reduce 
wheat production and cause economic losses. Moreover, the consumption of grains 
or cereal products mixed with darnel can cause dizziness, vomiting, and even 
death. Therefore, darnel is regarded as one of ″the worst weeds around the 
world″. In the present study, we predicted the potential global geographical 
distribution of L. temulentum using an optimal MaxEnt model, based on occurrence 
records and related environmental variables. The mean AUC, TSS, and KAPPA were 
0.95, 0.778, and 0.75, indicating the MaxEnt model accuracy was excellent. The 
significant environmental variables, including the mean temperature of coldest 
quarter (bio 11), precipitation of coldest quarter (bio 19), temperature annual 
range (bio 7), and annual precipitation (bio 12), produced a great impact on the 
potential global geographical distribution of L. temulentum. Under the current 
climate, L. temulentum was primarily distributed in south-eastern Asia, Europe, 
and south-eastern North America. The widest total suitable habitat was 
distributed in Asia, covering nearly 796 × 104 km2. By the 2050s, the potential 
geographical distribution of L. temulentum was expected to decrease in the 
Northern Hemisphere, and shrink gradually in southern America, Africa, and 
Oceania. Moreover, the distribution center of L. temulentum was expected to 
shift from Asia to Europe. Based on these predictions, changes in the suitable 
habitats for L. temulentum between Europe and Asia warrant close attention to 
prevent further spread.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the (direct and indirect) impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic on mortality for actual populations of persons living in 12 European 
countries in 2020.
METHOD: Based on demographic and mortality data, as well as remaining life 
expectancies found in the Human Mortality Database, we calculated a "population 
life loss" in 2020 for men and women living in Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, 
Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and 
Switzerland. This quantity was obtained by dividing the total number of years 
lost in 2020 (estimated from all-cause mortality data and attributed directly or 
indirectly to COVID-19) by the size of the population.
RESULTS: A significant population life loss was found in 8 countries in 2020, 
with men losing an average of 8.7, 5.0, 4.4, 4.0, 3.7, 3.4, 3.1, and 2.7 days in 
Lithuania, Spain, Belgium, Hungary, Croatia, Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden, 
respectively. For women, this loss was 5.5, 4.3, 3.7, 3.7, 3.1, 2.4, 1.6, and 
1.4 days, respectively. No significant losses were found in Finland, Luxembourg, 
Denmark and Norway. Life loss was highly dependent on age, reaching 40 days at 
the age of 90 in some countries, while only a few significant losses occurred 
under the age of 60. Even in countries with a significant population life loss 
in 2020, it was on average about 30 times lower than in 1918, at the time of the 
Spanish flu.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results based on the concept of population life loss were 
consistent with those based on the classical concept of life expectancy, 
confirming the significant impact of COVID-19 on mortality in 8 European 
countries in 2020. However, while life expectancy losses were typically counted 
in months or years, population life losses could be counted in days, a 
potentially useful piece of information from a public health perspective.

Epididymo-orchitis is a common urological condition that can be caused by a 
variety of etiologies, including retrograde extension of a urinary tract 
infection. Colovesical fistulas are frequent sequelae of diverticulitis that 
allow for communication between the colon and urinary bladder. Such fistulas 
facilitate the spread of enteric bacteria into the urinary bladder, with 
possible subsequent spread throughout the rest of the genitourinary system. 
Retrograde extension into the epididymis and testis is very rare, however. We 
present the case of a 38 year old man with epididymo-orchitis secondary to a 
colovesical fistula.

Gliomas are among the most common malignant tumors in the central nervous system 
and lead to poor life expectancy. However, the effective treatment of gliomas 
remains a considerable challenge. The recent development of near infrared (NIR) 
II (1000-1700 nm) theranostic agents has led to powerful strategies in 
diagnosis, targeted delivery of drugs, and accurate therapy. Because of the high 
capacity of NIR-II light in deep tissue penetration, improved spatiotemporal 
resolution can be achieved to facilitate the in vivo detection of gliomas via 
fluorescence imaging, and high contrast fluorescence imaging guided surgery can 
be realized. In addition to the precise imaging of tumors, drug delivery 
nano-platforms with NIR-II agents also allow the delivery process to be 
monitored in real-time. In addition, the combination of targeted drug delivery, 
photodynamic therapy, and photothermal therapy in the NIR region significantly 
improves the therapeutic effect against gliomas. Thus, this mini-review 
summarizes the recent developments in NIR-II fluorescence-based theranostic 
agents for glioma treatment.

Mutational patterns along different evolution paths of follicular lymphoma.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent disease, characterized by a median life 
expectancy of 18-20 years and by intermittent periods of relapse and remission. 
FL frequently transforms into the more aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
(t-FL). In previous studies, the analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable 
region (IgHV) genes in sequential biopsies from the same patient revealed two 
different patterns of tumor clonal evolution: direct evolution, through 
acquisition of additional IgHV mutations over time, or divergent evolution, in 
which lymphoma clones from serial biopsies independently develop from a 
less-mutated common progenitor cell (CPC). Our goal in this study was to 
characterize the somatic hypermutation (SHM) patterns of IgHV genes in 
sequential FL samples from the same patients, and address the question of 
whether the mutation mechanisms (SHM targeting, DNA repair or both), or 
selection forces acting on the tumor clones, were different in FL samples 
compared to healthy control samples, or in late relapsed/transformed FL samples 
compared to earlier ones. Our analysis revealed differences in the distribution 
of mutations from each of the nucleotides when tumor and non-tumor clones were 
compared, while FL and transformed FL (t-FL) tumor clones displayed similar 
mutation distributions. Lineage tree measurements suggested that either initial 
clone affinity or selection thresholds were lower in FL samples compared to 
controls, but similar between FL and t-FL samples. Finally, we observed that 
both FL and t-FL tumor clones tend to accumulate larger numbers of potential 
N-glycosylation sites due to the introduction of new SHM. Taken together, these 
results suggest that transformation into t-FL, in contrast to initial FL 
development, is not associated with any major changes in DNA targeting or 
repair, or the selection threshold of the tumor clone.

Background: Improved health care and rising life expectancy are creating a 
growing pool of old age people all over the world, including Africa. 
Malnutrition in the old age people is associated with both short- and long-term 
negative health outcomes. However, the reported burdens of malnutrition are 
fragmented and inconsistent, where more compiled evidence is warranted to aid 
decision-makers. Hence, this paper is aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of 
malnutrition among old age people in Africa. Methods: A systematic search for 
research reporting the prevalence of malnutrition among old age people (aged 
above 60 years) was conducted from HINARI/PubMed and Google Scholar databases 
using combination keywords. Published articles in English language starting from 
January 2000 to October 2021 were screened. We presented the results based on 
the standard for reporting systematic review and meta-analysis of observational 
studies. A random-effect meta-analysis was done to estimate the prevalence of 
malnutrition along with the 95% confidence intervals. The publication bias was 
assessed using the funnel plot. Results: A total of 1,442 studies were retrieved 
based on the search strategy, where only 36 studies (n = 15,266 participants) 
reported from 11 African countries were included for meta-analysis. The reported 
prevalence of malnutrition ranges from 2.2 to 77.3% across Africa. Overall, the 
pooled prevalence of malnutrition was 18% (95% CI: 15-22; I2 = 98.1; p < 0.001). 
The prevalence is higher in the Central Africa (3.8%; 95% CI: 3.2-4.4), in the 
community (3.1%; 95% CI: 2.7-3.7), and among advanced age (3.5%; 95% CI: 
2.3-5.4). Conclusion: The prevalence of malnutrition in African old age people 
is high and differs by setting, assessment tool, and country of residence. 
Hence, due attention to geriatric nutrition is mandatory, and the need for a 
valid, reliable, and simple screening tool should be thought of.

Echinococcus multilocularis, the causative agent of alveolar echinococcosis 
(AE), severely threats human health and livestock farming. The first line of 
chemotherapeutic drug for AE is albendazole, which limits rapid extension of E. 
multilocularis metacestodes, but is rarely curative for AE, with severe side 
effects in long-term use, thus development of new anti-echinococcal drugs is 
mandated. Pseudolaric acid B (PAB) has long been used to treat fungal-infected 
dermatosis, and exerted anti-tumor, -fertility, -angiogenesis, -tubulin and 
antiparasitic activity. However, the effect of PAB against Echinococcus spp. 
remains unclear. The present study is to understand the effect of PAB against E. 
multilocularis in vitro and in vivo, and identify potential anti-echinococcal 
mechanism, as well as its toxicity. After exposure to PAB at 20 μg/ml, 
significant reduction of the survival rate and substantial ultrastructural 
destructions in E. multilocularis protoscoleces were observed in vitro. 
Furthermore, the wet weight of E. multilocularis cysts in the infected mice was 
significantly decreased after treatment with PAB (40, 20 or 10 mg/kg) for 12 
weeks. Meanwhile, significant increase of both protein and mRNA expression of 
transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) was detected in the serum and liver 
of the infected mice, whereas PAB administration lowered its expression 
significantly. The toxicity tests demonstrated that PAB displayed lower 
cytotoxicity to human liver and kidney cells (HL-7702 and HK-2 cell) with 
IC50 = 25.29 and 42.94 μg/ml than albendazole with IC50 = 3.71 and 21.22 μg/ml 
in vitro, and caused lower hepatoxicity and nephrotoxicity in mice than ABZ. Our 
findings indicated that PAB possesses potent anti-echinococcal effect, with 
lower toxicity than albendazole, implying a potential chemotherapeutic agent for 
AE. Additionally, the present study demonstrated that the suppressive effect of 
PAB on the parasite may involve down-regulation of TGF-β1 signaling.

BACKGROUND: In recent decades, the world watched a dramatic increase in the 
incidence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) among young individuals (≤55 
years-old) and a relative decrease in the elderly. The management of ACS in 
young patients with multivessel disease still needs to be elucidated, as these 
individuals maintain a long life expectancy.
RESEARCH QUESTION: To compare clinical outcomes and care costs in individuals 
with premature ACS and multivessel disease undergoing coronary artery bypass 
graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants included all individuals ≤55 years-old 
admitted with ACS to public hospitals in Brasília (Brazil) between 2013 and 2015 
and who underwent cardiac catheterization with SYNTAX score ≥23 or Duke category 
6. Outcomes were adjudicated with death certificates and data from medical 
records. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular 
events (MACE), defined as death due to cardiovascular causes, recurrent 
hospitalizations due to cardiovascular ischemic events, and incident heart 
failure New York Heart Association III-IV. As secondary outcome we assessed 
indirect and direct costs by evaluating the cost of lost productivity (in 
international dollars (Int$) per year) due to illness and death, outpatient 
costs and costs with new hospitalizations. Multivariate and principal components 
(PC) adjusted analyzes were performed.
RESULTS: Among 1,088 subjects (111 CABG and 977 PCI) followed for 6.2 years 
(IQR: 1.1), 304 primary events were observed. MACE was observed in 20.7% of the 
CABG group and 28.8% of the PCI group (p = 0.037). In multivariate analyses, PCI 
was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.227 (95% CI: 1.004-1.499; p = 
0.0457) for MACE, and in PC-adjusted HR = 1.268 (95% CI: 1.048-1.548; p = 
0.0271) compared with CABG. Despite direct costs were equivalent, the cost due 
to the loss of labor productivity was higher in the PCI group (Int$ 4,511 (IQR: 
18,062)/year vs Int$ 3,578 (IQR: 13,198)/year; p = 0.049], compared with CABG.
CONCLUSIONS: Among young individuals with ACS and multivessel disease, surgical 
strategy was associated with a lower occurrence of MACE and lower indirect costs 
in the long-term.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that is associated with 
mortality in the final stage. The advancement of antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
improved the life expectancy of patients with HIV. However, the long age of such 
patients is associated with different comorbidities such as cardiovascular 
diseases. Also, HIV therapy increased the concern about cardiovascular diseases. 
This systematic review aims to assess the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) 
among patients with HIV by reviewing the previous studies conducted on this 
subject. Research gate, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases were explored 
starting from 2012 till 2022. The keywords used for the searching process 
included "HIV, MI, AMI, Association, Correlation, and Risk." The inclusion 
criteria were original articles conducted on HIV patients and reported 
MI, written in English language, and available in full text. A total of 1,570 
articles were obtained, but only seven articles met the inclusion criteria. The 
included studies were published between 2012 and 2019 and involved a total 
number of 496,600 participants; there were 266,274 who had HIV infection, with a 
sample size ranging from 1,147 to 252,150. The incidence of MI is higher among 
HIV compared to the general population. The risk factors associated with MI 
among HIV patients, as found in our analysis, included male gender, viral load 
of HIV, low CD4 count, higher CD8 count, and types of ART.

BACKGROUND: Disease burden is particularly high in Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria 
(CSU) patients with angioedema, and patients whose signs and symptoms are 
inadequately controlled by H1-antihistamines need new treatment options. Here we 
report an exploratory analysis, from the ligelizumab Phase 2b study, 
investigating angioedema occurrence in patients with CSU and describe the 
changes in angioedema following treatment with ligelizumab, omalizumab, or 
placebo.
METHODS: Data from the ligelizumab Phase 2b core (ligelizumab 72 mg, 240 mg, 
omalizumab 300 mg and placebo) and extension study (ligelizumab 240 mg) were 
used. Changes in Weekly Angioedema Activity Score (AAS7), the Dermatology Life 
Quality Index (DLQI), and Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) among each time 
point were analyzed for each treatment arm.
RESULTS: From a total of 297 patients analyzed, 165 (55.6%) reported angioedema 
occurrence at baseline, with mean AAS7 ranging 30.6-42.2 across treatment arms. 
At Week 12 of the core study 87.5%, 84.6%, 75.0%, and 61.0% of patients were 
angioedema free for ligelizumab 72 mg, 240 mg, omalizumab 300 mg, and placebo 
arms, respectively. In CSU patients with angioedema at baseline, the largest 
change from baseline in AAS7 score was observed with ligelizumab 72 mg (-31.9) 
at week 16 in the core study. Patients with angioedema had a higher mean DLQI at 
baseline (14.9-16.1) vs. patients without angioedema (10.6-12.0). In patients 
with angioedema, low AAS7 was significantly associated with complete response on 
UAS7 (UAS7 = 0) and complete normalization of DLQI (DLQI 0-1).
CONCLUSION: In the Phase 2b study, ligelizumab effectively reduced angioedema 
and urticaria symptoms, and improve health related quality of life in patients 
with moderate-to-severe CSU.

University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Detecting pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage may contribute to an 
increased survival. Patients with stage I pancreatic cancer have a 5-year 
survival rate of 36%, while stage IV patients have a 5-year survival rate of 1% 
in Sweden. Research into novel blood-based biomarkers for pancreatic cancer is 
highly intensive and innovative, but has yet to result in any routine screening 
test. The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of a 
hypothetical blood test for pancreatic cancer used for screening purposes and 
the economic aspects of testing.
METHOD: A model of a screening test was created, with varying specificity and 
sensitivity both set at 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 99% and applied to selected risk 
groups. Excessive costs of false positive screening outcomes, QALYs, ICERs and 
total costs were calculated.
RESULTS: Individuals with family history and genetic mutations associated with 
pancreatic cancer, new-onset diabetes ≥50 years of age and early symptoms had 
the highest positive predictive values and ICERs beneath the 
willingness-to-pay-level of EUR 100,000/QALY. Screening of the general 
population and smokers resulted in a high rate of false positive cases and 
extensive extra costs.
CONCLUSIONS: General screening for pancreatic cancer is not cost-effective, 
while screening of certain high-risk groups may be economically justified given 
the availability of a high-performing blood-based test.

Upregulation of Notch signaling is associated with brain arteriovenous 
malformation (bAVM), a disease that lacks pharmacological treatments. 
Tetracycline (tet)-regulatable endothelial expression of constitutively active 
Notch4 (Notch4*tetEC) from birth induced bAVMs in 100% of mice by P16. To test 
whether targeting downstream signaling, while sustaining the causal Notch4*tetEC 
expression, induces AVM normalization, we deleted Rbpj, a mediator of Notch 
signaling, in endothelium from P16, by combining tet-repressible Notch4*tetEC 
with tamoxifen-inducible Rbpj deletion. Established pathologies, including AV 
connection diameter, AV shunting, vessel tortuosity, intracerebral hemorrhage, 
tissue hypoxia, life expectancy, and arterial marker expression were improved, 
compared with Notch4*tetEC mice without Rbpj deletion. Similarly, Rbpj deletion 
from P21 induced advanced bAVM regression. After complete AVM normalization 
induced by repression of Notch4*tetEC, virtually no bAVM relapsed, despite 
Notch4*tetEC re-expression in adults. Thus, inhibition of endothelial Rbpj 
halted Notch4*tetEC bAVM progression, normalized bAVM abnormalities, and 
restored microcirculation, providing proof of concept for targeting a downstream 
mediator to treat AVM pathologies despite a sustained causal molecular lesion.

Neuronal diseases and trauma are among the current major health-care problems. 
Patients frequently develop an irreversible state of neuronal disfunction that 
lacks treatment, strongly reducing life quality and expectancy. Novel strategies 
are thus necessary and tissue engineering research is struggling to provide 
alternatives to current treatments, making use of biomaterials capable to 
provide cell supports and active stimuli to develop permissive environments for 
neural regeneration. As neuronal cells are naturally found in electrical 
microenvironments, the electrically active materials can pave the way for new 
and effective neuroregenerative therapies. In this work the influence of 
piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) with different surface charges and 
dynamic mechanoelectrical stimuli on neuron-like cells adhesion, proliferation 
and differentiation was addressed. It is successfully demonstrated that both 
surface charge and electrically active dynamic microenvironments can be suitable 
to improve neuron-like cells adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. These 
findings provide new knowledge to develop effective approaches for preclinical 
applications.

BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is one of the musculoskeletal 
system pathologies frequently encountered especially in women.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to compare the efficacy of an online 
exercise program with a home exercise program including the same exercises, and 
a control group planned for females with PFPS.
METHODS: The study included 60 females with PFPS aged 33.17 ± 6.84. Participants 
were randomly divided into 3 groups. One of the groups was given a 6-week home 
program consisting of evidence-based exercises. Exercises consisting of the same 
exercises were supervised online to another group. The third group did not 
receive any intervention. Pain, knee joint range of motion, muscle strength in 
flexion and extension and hip posterolateral muscle group, patellofemoral joint 
functionality, quality of life, recurrence of injury and fear of movement were 
measured at preintervention and postintervention.
RESULTS: Participation in the online supervised exercise group was seen to 
result in a greater decrease in pain during activity and kinesiophobia, and a 
greater increase in the quality of life mental health sub-dimension compared to 
the home exercise group.
CONCLUSION: Online supervised exercise groups could be an alternative 
telerehabilitation method for exercise programs established for women with PFPS.
