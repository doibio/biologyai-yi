The terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab was shown to improve myasthenia 
gravis-related symptoms in the 26-week, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled REGAIN study (NCT01997229). In this 52-week sub-analysis of 
the open-label extension of REGAIN (NCT02301624), eculizumab's efficacy and 
safety were assessed in 11 Japanese and 88 Caucasian patients with 
anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive refractory generalized myasthenia 
gravis. For patients who had received placebo during REGAIN, treatment with 
open-label eculizumab resulted in generally similar outcomes in the Japanese and 
Caucasian populations. Rapid improvements were maintained for 52 weeks, assessed 
by change in score from open-label extension baseline to week 52 (mean [standard 
error]) using the following scales (in Japanese and Caucasian patients, 
respectively): Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (-2.4 [1.34] 
and - 3.3 [0.65]); Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (-2.9 [1.98] and - 4.3 
[0.79]); Myasthenia Gravis Composite (-4.5 [2.63] and - 4.9 [1.19]); and 
Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15-item questionnaire (-8.6 [5.68] and - 6.5 
[1.93]). Overall, the safety of eculizumab was consistent with its known safety 
profile. In this interim sub-analysis, the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in 
Japanese and Caucasian patients were generally similar, and consistent with the 
overall REGAIN population.

The effect of four different coating dispersions including chitosan, clove 
essential oil, chitosan nanoparticles and clove essential oil loaded chitosan 
nanoparticles (CEO-ChNPs or encapsulated oil) was investigated on shelf life and 
quality of minimally processed pomegranate arils during storage at 5 °C. Among 
tested dispersions, CEO-ChNPs extended aril shelf life for 54 days while 
uncoated arils became unusable at day 18 due to the incidence of fungal decay. 
At the end of storage, CEO-ChNPs could significantly maintain microbial quality, 
weight, total soluble solid, titratable acidity, pH, total phenol and total 
anthocyanin content, as well as antioxidant activity and sensory quality in 
pomegranate arils coated with CEO-ChNPs compared to uncoated arils, however only 
some of mentioned parameters maintained significantly in arils coated with other 
dispersions (P < 0.05). According to these results, CEO-ChNPs were the most 
effective coating for extending shelf life and controlling undesirable 
microbial, physicochemical and sensory alterations of pomegranate arils.

The cost of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the treatment of chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML) is a substantial economic burden. In Japan, imatinib, 
dasatinib, and nilotinib are now approved as first-line treatment of CML in 
chronic phase. Recent "stop TKI" trials have shown that TKIs can be safely 
discontinued in nearly one-half of patients with sustained deep molecular 
response (DMR). In this study, we analyzed the cost-effectiveness of a simulated 
10 years of CML treatment including stop TKI in both the United States and 
Japan. We constructed Markov models to compare 4 strategies in which treatment 
was initiated with imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or any of these TKIs at the 
physician's discretion. Treatment was switched to another TKI in the case of 
intolerance or resistance to the initial TKI, and TKIs were discontinued if DMR 
persisted for 2 years. "Imatinib first" offered 7.34 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) at the cost of $1 022 148 in the United States (US dollars) and 
¥32 526 785 in Japan (Japanese yen). In comparison with imatinib first, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY of "dasatinib first" (7.68 QALY, 
$1 236 052, ¥51 506 254), "nilotinib first" (7.64 QALY, $1 245 667, 
¥39 635 598), and "physician's choice" (7.55 QALY, $1 167 818, ¥41 187 740) was 
$641 324, $696 717, and $666 634 in the United States and ¥54 456 325, 
¥23 154 465, and ¥39 635 615 in Japan, respectively. None of the 3 strategies 
met the willingness-to-pay threshold. The results were robust to univariate and 
multivariate sensitivity analyses. Imatinib first was shown to be the most 
cost-effective approach even with the incorporation of stop TKI.

Mass media campaigns have been hailed as some of the most effective tobacco 
prevention interventions. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of the 
national tobacco prevention campaign, truth® FinishIt, to determine the cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved and the return on investment (ROI). The 
cost-utility analysis used four main parameters: program costs, number of 
smoking careers averted, treatment costs, and number of QALYs saved whenever a 
smoking career is averted. Parameters were varied to characterize 
cost-effectiveness under different assumptions (base case, conservative, 
optimistic, and most optimistic). The ROI estimate compared campaign 
expenditures to the cost saved due to the campaign implementation. Analyses were 
conducted in 2019. The base case analysis indicated the campaign results in a 
societal cost savings of $3.072 billion. Under the most conservative 
assumptions, estimates indicated the campaign was highly cost-effective at $1076 
per QALY saved. The overall ROI estimate was $174 ($144 in costs to smokers, $24 
in costs to the smoker's family, and $7 in costs to society) in cost savings for 
every $1 spent on the campaign. In all analyses, the FinishIt campaign was found 
to reach or exceed the threshold levels of cost savings or cost-effectiveness, 
with a positive ROI. These findings point to the value of this important 
investment in the health of the younger generation.

BACKGROUND: Barth syndrome (BTHS, OMIM 302060) is a rare, life-threatening, 
x-linked genetic disorder that occurs almost exclusively in males and is 
characterized by cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal muscle myopathy primarily 
affecting larger muscles, and shorter stature in youth. A greater number of 
individuals with BTHS are now surviving into adulthood due to advancements in 
diagnosis and disease management. Given these improvements in life expectancy, 
understanding the disease experience over time has become increasingly important 
to individuals with the condition, treatment developers, and regulatory 
agencies. A study was conducted to explore the experience of BTHS from the 
perspective of adult males at least 35 years of age with the condition via 
in-depth qualitative interviews.
RESULTS: Findings showed that adults with BTHS experienced a variety of 
signs/symptoms with variable onset and severity throughout their lives, the most 
frequently reported being the symptoms of tiredness, muscle weakness, and a fast 
and/or irregular heart rate, and the sign of short stature in youth. These 
signs/symptoms negatively impacted individuals' emotional, physical, social, and 
role functioning. Tiredness and weakness impacted some individuals' physical 
functioning from an early age and into adulthood. These symptoms generally 
worsened over time, increasingly interfering with individuals' ability to fully 
participate in paid and unpaid labor and to partake in family and leisure 
activities.
CONCLUSIONS: This research complements recent studies characterizing the 
potentially degenerative and progressive nature of BTHS and can encourage future 
research into the natural history and progression of BTHS in untreated 
individuals. Participants' interview responses revealed a range of symptoms and 
the potential for multiple impacts on individuals' physical, social, emotional, 
and role functioning as a result of BTHS symptoms, yet also revealed variability 
in severity of experience as well as the possibility of resilience and 
adaptation to the condition.

Aortic coarctation presents in adult life in a significant number of patients. 
The preferred treatment in this age group is percutaneous stent implantation 
without which life expectancy is reduced due to the complications of 
uncontrolled hypertension. We present the first case of an "uncrossable" aortic 
coarctation transversed using the BEACON (Brief Electrification of a guidewire 
to assist in crossing an Aortic CoarctatiON) technique, a novel approach 
incorporating the electrification of a guidewire. It requires standard 
transcaval equipment and techniques but crosses from aortic lumen-to-lumen 
instead of cava-to-aorta, thus creating a rail for successful stent delivery.

INTRODUCTION: The number of patients taking oral chemotherapy is increasing 
around the world. It is essential to maximise the adherence to oral chemotherapy 
to improve the overall survival and life expectancy of the patients. In this 
systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of 
mobile applications in improving the adherence to oral chemotherapy and adjuvant 
hormonal therapy in cancer survivors.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, Scopus and 
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched for 
randomised or quasi-experimental studies published between January 2009 and July 
2019. This systematic review and meta-analysis will include studies 
investigating the use of mobile applications by cancer survivors to aid 
adherence to oral chemotherapy and adjuvant hormonal therapy. Patient education, 
reminder tools, calendars, pillboxes and electronic reminders will not be 
evaluated. The primary outcome will be the improvement in adherence to 
anticancer drugs. The secondary outcomes will be an improvement in the overall 
survival and life expectancy, improved quality of life and control of 
cancer-related symptoms. Three independent reviewers will select the studies and 
extract data from the original publications. The risk-of-bias will be assessed 
using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Data synthesis will be performed using the 
Review Manager software (RevMan V.5.2.3). To assess heterogeneity, we will 
compute the I2 statistics. Additionally, a quantitative synthesis will be 
performed if the included studies are sufficiently homogenous.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will be a review of the published data, and 
thus, ethical approval is not required. Findings of this systematic review will 
be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

OBJECTIVE: To directly estimate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due 
to stroke in rural Gadchiroli, India and measure the contribution of mortality 
and disability to total DALYs lost.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study using population census, vital 
registration and stroke prevalence data.
SETTING: A demographic surveillance site of 86 villages in Gadchiroli, a rural 
district in Maharashtra, India.
PARTICIPANTS: Population counts and mortality information were drawn from a 
census and vital registration system covering a population of approximately 
94 154 individuals; stroke prevalence information was based on a door-to-door 
evaluation of all 45 053 individuals from 39 of the 86 villages in the 
surveillance site.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability 
(YLD) and DALYs lost due to stroke.
RESULTS: There were 229 stroke deaths among the total population of 94 154 
individuals and 175 stroke survivors among the subpopulation of 45 053 
individuals. An estimated 2984 DALYs were lost due to stroke per 100 000 
person-years with a higher burden among men compared with women (3142 vs 2821 
DALYs). Over three-fourths (80%) of the total DALYs lost due to stroke were 
between ages 30 and 70 years. YLL accounted for 98.9% of total DALYs lost.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a high burden of stroke in rural Gadchiroli with a 
significant burden at premature ages. These results reveal a substantial need 
for surveillance and improved preventive and curative services for stroke in 
rural India.

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of the Pill 
Protect (PP) genetic screening test for venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk 
compared with standard of care (SoC), for women considering combined hormonal 
contraceptives (CHCs) in Switzerland.
METHODS: A two-part microsimulation model was developed to estimate VTE events, 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with the PP and SoC 
strategies. In the first portion of the model, a cohort of 1 million Swiss 
first-time seekers of a CHC were simulated. It was determined whether each women 
would receive a CHC or non-CHC by using prescribing patterns elicited from a 
modified Delphi study. These results formed the basis of the SoC strategy. For 
the PP strategy, a PP test was included and the results considered in addition 
to SoC practice. Each woman then entered a Markov model that captured morbidity 
and mortality over a lifetime. The risk of having a VTE was derived from the 
risk algorithm that underpins the PP test. The remaining model inputs relating 
to population characteristics, costs, health resource use, mortality and 
utilities were derived from published studies or national sources. The model was 
validated and calibrated to align with population-based studies. Extensive 
uncertainty analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: From a Swiss health system perspective, the PP strategy in comparison 
with the SoC strategy generated an additional CHF 231, and gained 0.003 QALYs 
per woman, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 76 610 per 
QALY gained. Assuming a threshold of CHF 100 000 per QALY gained, the PP 
strategy is likely to be cost effective. Our results were generally robust to 
variations in the parameter values.
CONCLUSIONS: The PP test may be cost effective in Switzerland for screening 
women seeking CHCs for their risk of VTE based on the current evidence.

Diagnosis and management of acute esophageal necrosis.

Dias E(1), Santos-Antunes J(1), Macedo G(1).

Author information:

João, Porto, Portugal.

Acute esophageal necrosis is a rare syndrome classically characterized by a 
striking endoscopic image of diffuse and circumferential black mucosal 
discoloration of distal esophagus, with an abrupt transition at the 
gastroesophageal junction and variable proximal extension. The typical patient 
is an older male with general debilitation and multiple comorbidities presenting 
with hematemesis or melena. The pathophysiology usually involves a combination 
of esophageal ischemia, backflow injury from gastric chemical contents and 
impaired mucosal reparative mechanisms associated with debilitated physical 
states. It may arise in the setting of hemodynamic compromise, diabetic 
ketoacidosis, hypothermia, alcoholic intoxication, trauma, inflammatory 
diseases, esophageal local infection, solid organ transplantation, postoperative 
status, drugs or acute gastric outlet obstruction, usually in the background of 
a chronic debilitating process, where the concurrent presence of multiple risk 
factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, malnutrition, malignancy or 
alcohol abuse, places a patient at higher risk. The characteristic endoscopic 
appearance establishes the diagnosis. Biopsy is supportive but not required. 
Management is mainly supportive and consists of correcting coexisting 
conditions, fluid therapy, bowel rest, intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy 
and red blood cell transfusion as needed. Although this is a serious 
life-threatening condition, appropriate treatment may result in a favorable 
outcome in the majority of patients.

Invasive thymoma commonly infiltrates mediastinal structures; however, 
intracardiac extension from an intracaval growth is rare. An unusual case of an 
invasive thymoma protruding into the RA is here described. A left 
brachiocephalic vein (LBCV) tumor appeared through the thymic veins of a 
50-year-old female patient. The patient underwent a combined resection of the 
invasive tumor and superior vena cava (SVC) and right atrium (RA) under 
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Pathologic examination revealed this to be a WHO 
type B3 thymoma, Masaoka stage III. Following surgery, the patient's symptoms 
disappeared, and the quality of life improved. The patient was then introduced 
to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This present case indicates that surgical 
treatment can create the opportunity for radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and is 
suitable and necessary for the treatment of invasive thymoma.

BACKGROUND: Lewy Body dementia (LBD) is the second most prevalent 
neurodegenerative dementia. This form of dementia is notable for an aggressive 
disease course consisting of a combination of cognitive, Parkinsonian, 
affective, and physiological symptoms that significantly increase morbidity and 
mortality, and decrease life expectancy in this population compared to more 
common dementias. Additionally, those diagnosed with LBD are often excluded from 
trials evaluating exercise in similar diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or 
Parkinson's disease due to the complexity and concurrency of motor and cognitive 
symptoms. Consequently, there is scarce research evaluating the effect of 
exercise on individuals with LBD.
METHODS: The PRomoting Independence in Lewy Body Dementia through Exercise 
(PRIDE) trial is a novel non-randomised, crossover pilot study consisting of an 
8-week wait-list usual care period, followed by an 8-week exercise intervention 
targeting progressive resistance and balance training. The trial aim is to 
evaluate the effect of exercise on the primary outcome of functional 
independence and secondary outcomes including cognitive, physical, psychosocial 
and quality of life measures in people living with LBD and their caregivers. The 
intervention involves 3 supervised 1-h sessions per week (24 sessions in total) 
administered by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist in a clinical facility at 
the University of Sydney in Lidcombe, Australia.
DISCUSSION: The PRIDE study is the first controlled trial to evaluate a robust 
exercise intervention within a LBD cohort and will provide crucial information 
required to inform robust future clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Data on Neo+/- adjuvant treatment in older patients with cancer is 
sparse. The management of locally advanced esophagogastric cancer (LAEC) in 
older patients was evaluated to determine treatment modalities and identify 
factors associated with survival.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with LAEC (stage II or III) over 5 years were 
identified from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland. Treatment was 
classified as "best supportive care (BSC)," "surgery only," "neo/adjuvant 
treatment," and "chemo/radiation alone."Survival was assessed. Univariate and 
multivariate analysis (MVA) of clinicopathological factors and treatment was 
conducted.
RESULTS: Forty-six percent (n = 580) of the 1251 patients were ≥ 70 years, 11% 
(n = 134) received BSC, 23% (n = 288) surgery only, 31% (n = 390) had 
chemo/radiation alone, and 35% (n = 439) had neo/adjuvant treatment. Forty-six 
percent, 10%, and 0% of patients < 75, ≥ 75, and ≥ 80 years of age, 
respectively, received neoadjuvant treatment. Age was associated with treatment 
received (p < 0.001). Older patients were less likely to receive neo/adjuvant 
treatment, surgery, and any treatment. Median survival (OS) decreased with age 
(< 70 years: 23 months; 70-74: 19 months; 75-79: 13 months; ≥ 80 years: 10 
months). In MVA, older age, smoking, later stage, and higher grade were 
significantly associated with a higher risk of death. Patients receiving 
neo/adjuvant treatment had lower risk of death than any other treatment group 
regardless of age.
CONCLUSION: Older patients were less likely to receive treatment for LAEC than 
younger patients. Patients aged ≥ 70 years benefit from neo/adjuvant treatment. 
Prospective clinical trials focusing on older patients and incorporating life 
expectancy, comorbidities, and geriatric assessment are needed to guide 
treatment.

In 2018, patisiran was the first-ever RNA interference (RNAi)-based drug 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Now pharmacology textbooks may 
include a new drug class that results in the effect first described by Fire and 
Mello 2 decades ago: post-transcriptional gene silencing by a small-interfering 
RNA (siRNA). Patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR 
amyloidosis) present with mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene that lead to 
the formation of amyloid deposits in peripheral nerves and heart. The disease 
may also affect the eye and central nervous system. The formulation of patisiran 
comprises the RNAi drug encapsulated into a nanoparticle especially developed to 
deliver the anti-TTR siRNA into the main TTR producer: the liver. Hepatic cells 
contain apolipoprotein E receptors that recognize ApoE proteins opsonized in the 
lipid carrier and internalize the drug by endocytosis. Lipid vesicles are 
disrupted in the cell cytoplasm, and siRNAs are free to trigger the RNAi-based 
TTR gene silencing. The silencing process involves the binding of siRNA guide 
strand to 3'-untranslated region sequence of both mutant and wild-type TTR 
messenger RNA, which culminates in the TTR mRNA cleavage by the RNA-induced 
silencing complex (RISC) as the first biochemical drug effect. Patisiran 
0.3 mg/kg is administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Patients require 
premedication with anti-inflammatory drugs and antagonists of histamine H1 and 
H2 receptors to prevent infusion-related reactions and may require vitamin A 
supplementation. Following patisiran treatment, TTR knockdown remained stable 
for at least 2 years. Adverse effects were mild to moderate with unchanged 
hematological, renal, or hepatic parameters. No drug-related severe adverse 
effects occurred in a 24-month follow-up phase II open-label extension study. At 
the recommended dosage of patisiran, Cmax and AUC values (mean ± standard 
deviation) were 7.15 ± 2.14 μg/mL and 184 ± 159 μg·h/mL, respectively. The drug 
showed stability in circulation with > 95% encapsulated in lipid particles. 
Metabolization occurred by ribonuclease enzymes, with less than 1% excreted 
unchanged in the urine. Patisiran ameliorated neuropathy impairment according to 
the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 analysis of the phase III study. 
The Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy score and gait speed improved in 
51% of the patisiran-treated group in 18 months. Additionally, the modified body 
mass index showed positive outcomes. Altogether, the data across phase I-III 
clinical trials points to patisiran as an effective and safe drug for the 
treatment of hATTR amyloidosis. It is hoped that real-world data from a larger 
number of patients treated with patisiran will confirm the effectiveness of this 
first-approved siRNA-based drug.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Alimera 
Sciences, the company manufacturing fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 
(FAc) 0.19 mg (tradename ILUVIEN®), to submit evidence on the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of FAc for treating recurrent non-infectious uveitis. 
Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht University 
Medical Centre + , was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review 
Group (ERG). This paper contains a summary of the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness evidence submitted by the company, the ERG's critique on the 
submitted evidence, and the guidance issued by the NICE Appraisal Committee 
(AC). The company submission (CS) was mainly informed by the PSV-FAI-001 trial 
in which FAc was compared with (limited) current practice [(L)CP], which was not 
considered to be representative of UK clinical practice by the ERG. There was no 
comparison of FAc to any treatment listed in the final scope, and especially to 
the dexamethasone intravitreal implant (dexamethasone), which was considered to 
be a relevant comparator by the AC. The primary outcome of the PSV-FAI-001 was 
recurrence of uveitis in the treated eye. Most of the events for the primary 
outcome were imputed during the PSV-FAI-001 trial, which probably led to an 
overestimation of the number of recurrences of disease, and a biased estimate of 
the relative effectiveness of FAc versus (L)CP. Finally, the place of FAc in the 
treatment pathway was not clearly defined by the company. Substantial 
uncertainty surrounded the cost-effectiveness results due to the shortcomings of 
the clinical evidence. Additionally, the quality of life of patients was not 
measured during the PSV-FAI-001 trial and long-term effectiveness data of FAc 
were lacking. The ERG adjusted several issues identified in the CS and added 
dexamethasone as a comparator in the decision analytic model. The ERG presented 
multiple analyses as base-cases because several elements of the assessment 
remained uncertain. The fully incremental ERG results ranged from dexamethasone 
(extendedly) dominating FAc (when assuming a hazard ratio of 1 or 0.7 for 
dexamethasone versus FAc) to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
£30,153 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for FAc versus (L)CP [when 
assuming a hazard ratio of 0.456 for dexamethasone versus (L)CP]. The ICER of 
FAc versus (L)CP ranged from £12,325 to £30,153 per QALY gained. After a second 
AC meeting where alternative company scenarios comparing FAc with dexamethasone 
were considered by the AC, the AC concluded that "the results of the company's 
analyses ranged from the fluocinolone acetonide implant being dominant (that is, 
it was more effective and costs less), to an ICER of £29,461 per QALY gained, 
and most of the ICERs were below £20,000 per QALY gained". Therefore, the AC 
recommended FAc as a cost-effective use of National Health Service (NHS) 
resources for treating recurrent non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior 
segment of the eye in the final TA590 guidance (published July 2019).

Patients with aggressive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) have dismal 
outcomes with intensive chemotherapy. Early up-front allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is generally recommended. However, the 
choice of stem cell source, i.e., unrelated bone marrow transplant (UBMT) or 
cord blood transplantation (CBT), when an HLA-matched related donor is 
unavailable remains controversial. Thus, we undertook a decision analysis to 
compare the outcomes of two therapeutic strategies: chemotherapy followed by 
up-front UBMT at 6 months, and chemotherapy followed by up-front CBT at 3 
months. Patients were stratified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups 
according to the modified ATL-prognostic index. The model simulated life 
expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted LE (QALE). LE following up-front UBMT was 
higher than that following up-front CBT in the low-risk group (2.63 vs. 
2.28 years), but was comparable in the intermediate- (2.06 vs. 2.01 years) and 
high-risk groups (1.25 vs. 1.30 years). The Monte Carlo simulation for LE and 
QALE in each risk group showed that there was significant uncertainty in all 
categories. In conclusion, up-front UBMT was superior to up-front CBT in the 
low-risk group, but the strategies were comparable in the intermediate- and 
high-risk groups.

OBJECTIVE: This article aims to present a brief profile of the advances in 
prevention and treatment of myocardial injury in cancer therapy based on 
relevant literature or reports.
DATA SOURCES: The data cited in this review were obtained from articles indexed 
in PubMed and China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) up to June 2019.
STUDY SELECTION: Articles were selected with the following keywords "Anti-cancer 
therapy," "Myocardial injury," "Breast cancer," "Echocardiography," and 
"Chemotherapy."
RESULTS: Due to the rapid development of novel cancer therapeutic approaches, 
the life expectancy of tumor patients has been prolonged continuously. 
Meanwhile, a large number of studies have found that among patients benefiting 
from precise management, some medications have exerted direct or indirect side 
effects on the cardiovascular system, leading to the occurrence of myocardial
