Research on Diabetes, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

The burden of diabetes is high and increasing globally, and in developing 
economies like India, mainly fueled by the increasing prevalence of 
overweight/obesity and unhealthy lifestyles. The estimates in 2019 showed that 
77 million individuals had diabetes in India, which is expected to rise to over 
134 million by 2045. Approximately 57% of these individuals remain undiagnosed. 
Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for majority of the cases, can lead to 
multiorgan complications, broadly divided into microvascular and macrovascular 
complications. These complications are a significant cause for increased 
premature morbidity and mortality among individuals with diabetes, leading to 
reduced life expectancy and financial and other costs of diabetes leading to 
profound economic burden on the Indian health care system. The risk for diabetes 
is largely influence by ethnicity, age, obesity and physical inactivity, 
unhealthy diet, and behavioral habits in addition to genetics and family 
history. Good control of blood sugar blood pressure and blood lipid levels can 
prevent and/or delay the onset of diabetes complications. The prevention and 
management of diabetes and associated complications is a huge challenge in India 
due to several issues and barriers, including lack of multisectoral approach, 
surveillance data, awareness regarding diabetes, its risk factors and 
complications, access to health care settings, access to affordable medicines, 
etc. Thus, effective health promotion and primary prevention, at both, 
individual and population levels are the need of the hour to curb the diabetes 
epidemic and reduce diabetes-related complications in India.

Recent technological advances have led to an increasing understanding of the 
pathogenetic mechanisms behind lymphoid malignancies. Based on his new 
knowledge, novel agents and immune therapeutic strategies have been developed. 
The combination of diagnostic, therapeutic and surveillance-related precision 
medicine approaches may eventually represent the key for a substantial 
improvement in both life expectancy and quality of life, also for those patient 
groups presently characterised by the highest unmet clinical need, as argued in 
this review.

OBJECTIVE: The cost-effectiveness of NUDT15 genetic testing-guided initial 
6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) dosing in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) was evaluated.
METHODS: A decision tree model was used to evaluate the cost to China's medical 
system per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and cost per case of severe 
leukopenia avoided of NUDT15 genetic testing using public clinical data.
RESULTS: Genetic testing-guided initial 6-MP dosing reduced overall costs by 
$518.61, and prevented 0.221 cases of Grade III-IV leukopenia and increased QALY 
by 0.00136 per patient. Results were robust in one-way analyses and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: NUDT15 genetic testing prior to the initial administration of 6-MP 
in pediatric ALL patients in China is less expensive than standard dosing 
without genetic testing.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of life and surgical outcomes in patients 
with congenital cervicovaginal malformation after cervicovaginal reconstruction.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with congenital cervicovaginal 
aplasia and underwent cervicovaginal reconstruction using acellular porcine 
small intestinal submucosa (SIS) grafts were included in the study from January 
2012 to December 2019. Of these, twenty-one patients underwent conventional 
laparoscopy, nine underwent robotic surgery, and eight underwent 
laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery. Clinical characteristics, 
perioperative data, condition of the neovagina and neocevix, post-operation 
complications, body image, resumption of menstruation, sexual function, and 
quality of life were assessed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 16.4 ± 5.78 years. The operative 
procedure lasted 182.29 ± 70.85 min, with a hemoglobin decrease of 
12.53 ± 7.55 g/dl. All surgery was completed successfully without complications. 
The total cost was highest in the robotic surgery group (P < 0.001). The 
cosmetic scores were significantly higher in the LESS group (P < 0.001). At a 
median follow-up of 49.79 ± 31.02 months, all patients resumed menstruation, 
except one patient who underwent hysterectomy due to vaginal obstruction. The 
average length of neovagina was 8.11 ± 0.75 cm, and the length of the cervix was 
1.73 ± 1.00 cm. There were one patient with vaginal stenosis, two patients with 
cervical occlusion, two patients with cervical stenosis, and six patients with 
intrauterine device loss. Fourteen patients experienced sexual activity, with 
the total female sexual function index scores of 26.83 ± 3.49. Six patients had 
a desire of pregnancy, and one patient had pregnant via assisted-reproduction 
techniques. No differences in the mean physical component score (PCS) and mental 
component score (MCS) were identified among three different groups at baseline 
and all post-surgery time points (P > 0.05), but with the extension of 
follow-up, both PCS and MCS increased significantly in all groups (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Cervicovaginal reconstruction using an SIS graft is safe and 
efficient to the management of congenital cervicovaginal atresia whatever by the 
conventional laparoscopy, robotic surgery or LESS, with good surgical outcomes 
and high of quality of life.

OBJECTIVES: Despite its importance of quality measures used by the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services, the underlying cost-effectiveness evidence has 
not been examined. This study aimed to analyze cost-effectiveness evidence 
associated with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality measures.
METHODS: After classifying 23 quality measures with the Donabedian's 
structure-process-outcome quality of care model, we identified 
cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) relevant to these measures from the Tufts 
Medical Center CEA Registry based on the PICOTS (population, intervention, 
comparator, outcome, time horizon, and setting) framework. We then summarized 
available incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of the quality measures.
RESULTS: The 23 quality measures were categorized into 14 process, 7 outcome, 
and 2 structure measures. Cost-effectiveness evidence was only available for 8 
of 14 process measures. Two measures (Tobacco Screening and Hemoglobin bA1c 
Control) were cost-saving and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) improving, and 
5 (Depression Screening, Influenza Immunization, Colon Cancer Screening, Breast 
Cancer Screening, and Statin Therapy) were highly cost-effective (median ICER ≤ 
$50 000/QALY). The remaining measure (Fall Screening) had a median ICER of 
$120 000/QALY. No CEAs were available for 15 measures: 10 defined by subjective 
patient ratings and 5 employed outcome measures without specifying an 
intervention or process.
CONCLUSIONS: When relevant CEAs were available, cost-effectiveness evidence was 
consistent with quality measures (measures were cost-effective). Nevertheless, 
most quality measures were based on subjective ratings or outcome measures, 
posing a challenge in identifying supporting economic evidence. Refining and 
aligning quality measures with cost-effectiveness evidence can help further 
improve healthcare efficiency by demonstrating that they are good indicators of 
both quality and cost-effectiveness of care.

OBJECTIVES: Patients waking up with stroke symptoms are often excluded from 
intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase (IV-tpa). The WAKE-UP trial, a European 
multicenter randomized controlled trial, proved the clinical effectiveness of 
magnetic resonance imaging-guided IV-tpa for these patients. This analysis aimed 
to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to placebo.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed to analyze the cost-effectiveness over a 
25-year time horizon. The model consisted of an inpatient acute care phase and a 
rest-of-life phase. Health states were defined by the modified Rankin Scale 
(mRS). Initial transition probabilities to mRS scores were based on WAKE-UP data 
and health state utilities on literature search. Costs were based on data from 
the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, literature, and expert opinion. 
Incremental costs and effects over the patients' lifetime were estimated. The 
analysis was conducted from a formal German healthcare perspective. Univariate 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Treatment with IV-tpa resulted in cost savings of €51 009 and 1.30 
incremental gains in quality-adjusted life-years at a 5% discount rate. 
Univariate sensitivity analysis revealed incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
being sensitive to the relative risk of favorable outcome on mRS for placebo 
patients after stroke, the costs of long-term care for patients with mRS 4, and 
patient age at initial stroke event. In all cases, IV-tpa remained 
cost-effective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis proved IV-tpa cost-effective 
in >95% of the simulations results.
CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided IV-tpa compared to placebo is 
cost-effective in patients with ischemic stroke with unknown time of onset.

OBJECTIVES: There is growing interest in condition-specific preference measures, 
including the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality 
of Life Utility Measure-Core 10 Dimensions (QLU-C10D). This research assessed 
the implications of using utility indices on the basis of the EQ-5D-3L, a 
mapping of EQ-5D-3L to the EQ-5D-5L, and the QLU-C10D, and compared their 
psychometric properties.
METHODS: Data were taken from 8 phase 3 randomized controlled trials of 
nivolumab with or without ipilimumab for the treatment of solid tumors. 
Utilities for progression-related states were calculated using the UK and 
English value sets and incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) derived 
from established UK cost-effectiveness models. The psychometric properties of 
the utility indices were assessed using pooled trial data.
RESULTS: Compared with the EQ-5D-3L index, the mapped EQ-5D-5L index yielded an 
average of 6% more and the QLU-C10D index an average of 2% fewer incremental 
QALYs for nivolumab versus comparators. All indices could differentiate between 
groups defined by performance status, cancer stage, or self-reported health 
status at baseline and detect meaningful changes in performance status, tumor 
response, health status, and quality of life over approximately 12 weeks of 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The lower QALY yield of the QLU-C10D was balanced by evidence of 
greater validity and responsiveness. Benefits gained from using the QLU-C10D may 
be apparent when treatments affect targeted symptoms and functional aspects, 
including sleep, bowel function, appetite, nausea, and fatigue. The observed 
differences in QALYs may not be sufficiently large to affect health technology 
assessment decisions.

The recently reported prime editor (PE) can produce all types of base 
substitution, insertion and deletion, greatly expanding the scope of genome 
editing. However, improving the editing efficiency and precision of PE 
represents a major challenge. Here, we report an approach termed the homologous 
3' extension mediated prime editor (HOPE). HOPE uses paired prime editing guide 
RNAs (pegRNAs) encoding the same edits in both sense and antisense DNA strands 
to achieve high editing efficiency in human embryonic kidney 293T cells as well 
as mismatch repair-deficient human colorectal carcinoma 116 cells. In addition, 
we found that HOPE shows greatly improved product purity compared to the 
original PE3 system. We envision that this enhanced tool could broaden both 
fundamental research and therapeutic applications of prime editing.

The elderly population comprises a significant proportion of patients diagnosed 
with rectal cancer. However, there is a lack of evidence to guide treatment 
decisions in this group. Thus, this multicentre study compares the 
histopathology, treatment patterns and outcomes between the elderly and young 
populations with non-metastatic rectal cancer. The present study reported on the 
clinicopathological variables, treatment modalities and survival outcomes in 736 
patients diagnosed with non-metastatic rectal cancer between 2006 and 2015. 
Patients were divided into the following two groups, <70 and ≥70 years of age, 
which were compared using Chi-square and survival outcome analysis using 
Kaplan-Meier. Elderly patients made up nearly half of the cohort and were less 
likely to undergo trimodality therapy or be discussed in a multidisciplinary 
meeting. Surgery in the elderly patients was associated with increased 
mortality. Elderly patients had worse cancer-specific survival (75 vs. 85%), 
which was particularly evident in stage III disease (hazard ratio, 2.1). Elderly 
patients in this subgroup treated with trimodality therapy had similar survival 
outcomes to younger patients. Elderly patients with locally advanced rectal 
cancer comprise a large proportion of the patient cohort. Consideration should 
be given for trimodality therapy in this group, taking into account biological 
age, especially in the context of increasing life expectancy and improvement in 
the management of age-related comorbidities.

Introduction: Older adulthood encompasses several decades of change and 
heterogeneity. Primary care providers need a geriatric comprehensive vision for 
defining older adult subpopulations. Methods: Using PubMed and Google searches, 
we reviewed the literature on epidemiology of age-related physiological changes, 
age-related diseases and geriatric syndromes, functional state, and emotional 
and social changes. We divided old age into strata based on chronological age 
and strata based on functional state, disease burden, and geriatric syndromes. 
Results: We describe 4 chronological-age strata beginning at age 60, and 4 
functional-age strata based on frailty according to a modified clinical frailty 
scale. We provide clinical considerations and anticipatory guidance topics for 
each of the age strata and functional strata. Conclusion: Chronological age, 
functional status, chronic disease burden and geriatric syndromes, and life 
expectancy are all important domains that impact clinical care and appropriate 
anticipatory guidance for individual older adults. Better knowledge for 
differentiating subpopulations of older adults may improve clinical care, reduce 
medical overuse, improve personalized anticipatory guidance, and focus on the 
impact of functional state on the quality of life.

As life expectancy increases, it is imperative that the elderly take advantage 
of the benefits of technology to remain active and independent. Mobile health 
applications are widely used nowadays as they promote a healthy lifestyle and 
self-management of diseases, opening new horizons in the interactive health 
service delivery. However, adapting these applications to the needs and 
requirements of the elderly is still a challenge. This article presents a 
smartphone application that is part of a multifactorial intervention to support 
older people with balance disorders. The application aims to enable users to 
self-evaluate their activity and progress, to communicate with each other and, 
through strategically selected motivational features, to engage with the system 
with undiminished interest for a long period of time. Mock-up interfaces were 
evaluated in semi-structured focus groups and interviews that were performed
