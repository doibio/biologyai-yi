United States life tables eliminating certain causes of death, 1999-2001.

Arias E, Heron M, Tejada-Vera B.

OBJECTIVES: This report presents abridged cause-elimination life tables and 
multiple-decrement life table functions for 33 selected causes of death, by race 
(white and black) and sex, for the total United States. It is the fourth in a 
set of reports that present life table data for the United States and each state 
for the period 1999-2001.
METHODS: The life table functions presented in this report represent the 
mortality experience of a hypothetical cohort assuming that a particular cause 
of death is eliminated. The report includes a description of the methodology 
used to estimate the life table functions shown in four sets of tables. Each set 
contains seven tables, one each for the total population, total males, total 
females, white males, white females, black males, and black females.
RESULTS: From birth, a person has a 31% chance of dying of Diseases of heart 
(heart disease) and a 22% chance of dying of Malignant neoplasms (cancer). In 
contrast, the probabilities of dying from Accidents (unintentional injuries), 
Diabetes mellitus (diabetes), and Septicemia--3 of the 10 leading causes of 
death in 1991-2001--are much smaller. Likewise, elimination of heart disease 
would increase life expectancy at birth by almost 4 years, and elimination of 
cancer by more than 3 years. Other leading causes of death have a much smaller 
impact.

OBJECTIVES: Using new facilities for linking large databases, we aimed to 
evaluate for the first time the magnitude of relative and absolute educational 
inequalities in mortality by sex and cause of death in the Netherlands.
METHODS: We analyzed data from Dutch Labour Force Surveys (1998-2002) with 
mortality follow-up 1998-2007 among people aged 30-79 years. We calculated 
hazard ratios using Cox proportional hazards model, age-standardized mortality 
rates and partial life expectancy by education. We compared results for the 
Netherlands with those for other European countries.
RESULTS: The relative risk of dying was about two times higher among primary 
educated men and women as compared to their tertiary educated counterparts, 
leading to a gap in partial life expectancy of 3.4 years (men) and 2.4 years 
(women). Inequalities in mortality are similar to those in other countries in 
North-Western Europe, but inequalities in lung cancer mortality are 
substantially larger in the Netherlands, particularly among men.
CONCLUSIONS: The Netherlands has large inequalities in mortality, especially for 
smoking-related causes of death. These large inequalities require the urgent 
attention of policy makers.

Challenges in treating elderly patients with haemophilia: a focus on cardiology.

Seventy years ago, the average life expectancy for patients with severe 
haemophilia A was less than 17 years. Today, due to the availability of safe and 
effective clotting factor concentrates, life expectancy is nearly normal, at 
least in patients without viral infections. More individuals are living into 
their 70s and 80s, acquiring a range of diseases that are common in elderly 
persons. One of the most important challenges includes the treatment of 
comorbidities, especially cardiovascular diseases. Although most evidence 
suggests that haemophilia, at least the severe manifestation, partially protects 
against myocardial infarction, stroke and venous thromboembolism, typical 
cardiovascular risk factors can still be present despite the clotting defect. 
Patients with haemophilia are equally or even more prone to obesity, 
hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia, and this is especially true for 
HIV-infected individuals using highly active antiretroviral therapy. The 
management of elderly haemophilia patients with cardiovascular comorbidities is 
hampered by a lack of evidence-based guidelines. Nevertheless, experience in 
treating cardiovascular disease is growing amongst the haemophilia community, 
and several authors have published their own recommendations for managing a 
variety of commonly encountered cardiovascular scenarios in haemophilia 
patients. Basic recommendations exist for risk-factor management, the adaptation 
of factor replacement therapy in the at-risk elderly, management of coronary 
revascularization, the management of acute coronary syndrome and atrial 
fibrillation. This review outlines our current knowledge about cardiovascular 
risk in elderly haemophilia patients, recommendations for clinical decision 
making, and our own experiences of managing individuals with coronary heart 
disease and atrial fibrillation.

Cost-effectiveness of second-generation antipsychotics for the treatment of 
schizophrenia.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of alternate treatment strategies 
using second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) for patients with schizophrenia.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) for different sequences of treatments for 40-year-old 
patients with schizophrenia. We considered first-line treatment with one of the 
four SGAs: olanzapine (OLZ), risperidone (RSP), quetiapine (QTP), and 
ziprasidone (ZSD). Patients could switch to another of these antipsychotics as 
second-line therapy, and only clozapine (CLZ) was allowed as third-line 
treatment. We derived parameter estimates from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial 
of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study and published sources.
RESULTS: The ZSD-QTP strategy (first-line treatment with ZSD, change to QTP if 
ZSD is discontinued, and switch to CLZ if QTP is discontinued) was most costly 
while yielding the greatest QALYs, with an incremental cost-effective ratio 
(ICER) of $542,500 per QALY gained compared with the ZSD-RSP strategy. However, 
the ZSD-RSP strategy had an ICER of $5,200/QALY gained versus the RSP-ZSD 
strategy and had the greatest probability of being cost-effective given a 
willingness-to-pay threshold between $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY. All other 
treatment strategies were more costly and less effective than another strategy 
or combination of other strategies. Results varied by different time horizons 
adopted.
CONCLUSIONS: The ZSD-RSP strategy was most cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold between $5,200 and $542,500 per QALY. Our results 
should be interpreted with caution because they are based largely on the CATIE 
trial with potentially limited generalizability to all patient populations and 
doses of SGAs used in practice.

New Zealand.

OBJECTIVE: To establish the cost-effectiveness of long-term humidification 
therapy (LTHT) added to usual care for patients with moderate or severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchiectasis.
METHODS: Resource usage in a 12-month clinical trial of LTHT was estimated from 
hospital records, patient diaries, and the equipment supplier. Health state 
utility values were derived from the St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire 
(SGRQ) total score. All patients who remained in the trial for 12 months and who 
had at least 90 days of diary records were included (87 of 108).
RESULTS: Clinical costs were NZ $3973 (95% confidence interval [CI] $1614-$6332) 
for the control group and NZ $3331 (95% CI $948-$6920) for the intervention 
group. The mean health benefit per patient was -6.9 SGRQ units (95% CI -13.0 to 
-7.2; P < 0.05) or +0.0678 quality-adjusted life-years (95% CI 0.001-0.135). 
With the intervention costing NZ $2059 annually, the mean cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year was NZ $20,902 (US $18,907) and the bootstrap median 
was NZ $19,749 (2.5th percentile -$40,923, 97.5th percentile $221,275). At a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of NZ $30,000, the probability of 
cost-effectiveness was 61%, ranging from 49% to 72% as the cost of LTHT was 
varied by ±30%. At a WTP of NZ $20,000, the probability was 49% (range 34%-61%).
CONCLUSIONS: LTHT is moderately cost-effective for patients with moderate to 
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchiectasis at a WTP 
threshold that is acceptable for public funding of medicines in New Zealand. 
These findings must be interpreted with caution because of the modest size of 
the clinical study, necessary lack of blinding in the clinical trial, and 
uncertainty in estimating health state utility from the SQRQ.

Is the UK NICE "reference case" influencing the practice of pediatric 
quality-adjusted life-year measurement within economic evaluations?

Birmingham, Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK. Electronic address: 
p.kinghorn@bham.ac.uk.

OBJECTIVES: To report findings from a systematic review, this article sought to 
address two related questions. First, how has the practice of UK pediatric 
cost-utility analyses evolved over time, in particular how are health-related 
outcomes assessed and valued? Second, how do the methods compare to the limited 
guidance available, in particular, the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) reference case(s)?
METHODS: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were 
conducted for the period May 2004 to April 2012 and the Paediatric Economic 
Database Evaluation database for the period May 2004 to December 2010. 
Identified studies were screened by three independent reviewers.
RESULTS: Forty-three studies were identified, 11 of which elicit utility values 
through primary research. A discrepancy was identified between the methods used 
for outcome measurement and valuation and the methods advocated within the NICE 
reference case. Despite NICE recommending the use of preference-based 
instruments designed specifically for children, most studies that were 
identified had used adult measures. In fact, the measurement of quality-adjusted 
life-years is the aspect of economic evaluation with the greatest amount of 
variability and the area that most digressed from the NICE reference case.
CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations stemming from the review are that all studies 
should specify the age range of childhood and include separate statements of 
perspective for costs and effects as well as the reallocation of research 
funding away from systematic review studies toward good quality primary research 
measuring utilities in children.

Long-term safety and efficacy of fractionated stereotactic body radiation 
therapy for spinal metastases.

Author information:
(1)Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Würzburg, 
Josef-Schneider-Straße 11, 97080, Würzburg, Germany, mantel_f@ukw.de.

PURPOSE: Patients with long life expectancy despite metastatic status might 
benefit from long-term local control of spinal metastases. Dose-intensified 
radiotherapy (RT) is believed to control tumor growth better and thus offers 
longer pain relief. This single-institution study reports on fractionated 
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for spinal metastases in patients 
with good life expectancy based on performance status, extent of metastases, 
histology, and time to metastasis.
METHODS: Between 2004 and 2010, 36 treatment sites in 32 patients (median age 55 
years; male 61%; median Karnofsky performance score 85) were treated with 
fractionated SBRT. The median treatment dose was 60 Gy (range, 48.5-65 Gy) given 
in a median of 20 fractions (range, 17-33); the median maximum dose to the 
planning risk volume for the spinal cord (PRV-SC) was 46.6 Gy.
RESULTS: All patients suffering from pain prior to RT reported pain relief after 
treatment; after a median follow-up of 20.3 months, 61% of treatment sites were 
pain-free, another 25% associated with mild pain. In 86% of treatments, patients 
were free from neurological symptoms at the time of the last clinical follow-up. 
Acute grade 1 toxicities (CTCAE 3.0) were observed in 11 patients. Myelopathy 
did not occur in any patient. Radiologically controlled freedom from local 
progression was 92 and 84% after 12 and 24 months, respectively. Median overall 
survival (OS) was 19.6 months.
CONCLUSION: Patient selection resulted in long OS despite metastatic disease, 
and dose-intensified fractionated SBRT for spinal metastases was safe and 
achieved long-term local tumor control and palliation of pain.

PURPOSE: To describe changes in joint motion, sensibility, and scar pliability 
and to investigate the patients' expectations, self-reported recovery, and 
satisfaction with hand function, disability, and quality of life after surgery 
and hand therapy for Dupuytren disease.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study collected measurements before surgery and 
3, 6, and 12 months after surgery and hand therapy. Ninety patients with total 
active extension deficits of 60° or more from Dupuytren contracture were 
included. Outcomes measures were range of motion; sensibility; scar pliability; 
self-reported outcomes on expectations, recovery, and satisfaction with hand 
function; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores; safety and social 
issues of hand function; physical activity habits; and quality of life with the 
Euroqol.
RESULTS: The extension deficit decreased, and there was a transient decrease in 
active finger flexion during the first year after surgery. Sensibility remained 
unaffected. Generally, patients with surgery on multiple fingers had worse scar 
pliability. The majority of the patients had their expectations met, and at 6 
months, 32% considered hand function as fully recovered, and 73% were satisfied 
with their hand function. Fear of hurting the hand and worry about not trusting 
the hand function were of greatest concern among safety and social issues. The 
Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score and the Euroqol improved over 
time.
CONCLUSIONS: After surgery and hand therapy, disability decreased independent of 
single or multiple operated fingers. The total active finger extension improved 
enough for the patients to reach a functional range of motion despite an 
impairment of active finger flexion still present 12 months after treatment.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy, the incidence rate of epilepsy in 
the elderly has considerably increased in recent decades. This leads to new 
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
OBJECTIVES: Recognition of the special clinical features of epilepsy in the 
elderly is essential for diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Special consideration 
is placed on comorbidity and drug interactions.
METHODS: The literature and new developments in this field are reviewed and 
discussed.
RESULTS: Epilepsy often presents in patients older than 60 years for the first 
time. The etiology of epilepsy in the elderly is heterogeneous with most 
belonging to symptomatic epilepsies that are associated with an underlying 
structural lesion of the brain. Epilepsy in the elderly is distinguished from 
that in other age groups by its clinical presentation. The treatment of seizures 
in the elderly is a particular challenge because not only due to comorbidity and 
co-medication but also because of metabolic changes in this age group.
CONCLUSION: Epilepsy in the elderly has diagnostic and therapeutic features that 
require careful clinical assessment and differentiated therapy.

Epidemiology of neurodegenerative diseases in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic 
review.

andre.kengne@mrc.ac.za.

BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries are experiencing rapid 
transitions with increased life expectancy. As a result the burden of 
age-related conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases might be increasing. 
We conducted a systematic review of published studies on common 
neurodegenerative diseases, and HIV-related neurocognitive impairment in SSA, in 
order to identify research gaps and inform prevention and control solutions.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, 'Banque de Données de Santé Publique' 
and the database of the 'Institut d'Epidemiologie Neurologique et de Neurologie 
Tropicale' from inception to February 2013 for published original studies from 
SSA on neurodegenerative diseases and HIV-related neurocognitive impairment. 
Screening and data extraction were conducted by two investigators. 
Bibliographies and citations of eligible studies were investigated.
RESULTS: In all 144 publications reporting on dementia (n = 49 publications, 
mainly Alzheimer disease), Parkinsonism (PD, n = 20), HIV-related neurocognitive 
impairment (n = 47), Huntington disease (HD, n = 19), amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS, n = 15), cerebellar degeneration (n = 4) and Lewy body dementia 
(n = 1). Of these studies, largely based on prevalent cases from retrospective 
data on urban populations, half originated from Nigeria and South Africa. The 
prevalence of dementia (Alzheimer disease) varied between <1% and 10.1% (0.7% 
and 5.6%) in population-based studies and from <1% to 47.8% in hospital-based 
studies. Incidence of dementia (Alzheimer disease) ranged from 8.7 to 
21.8/1000/year (9.5 to 11.1), and major risk factors were advanced age and 
female sex. HIV-related neurocognitive impairment's prevalence (all from 
hospital-based studies) ranged from <1% to 80%. Population-based prevalence of 
PD and ALS varied from 10 to 235/100,000, and from 5 to 15/100,000 respectively 
while that for Huntington disease was 3.5/100,000. Equivalent figures for 
hospital based studies were the following: PD (0.41 to 7.2%), ALS (0.2 to 
8.0/1000), and HD (0.2/100,000 to 46.0/100,000).
CONCLUSIONS: The body of literature on neurodegenerative disorders in SSA is 
large with regard to dementia and HIV-related neurocognitive disorders but 
limited for other neurodegenerative disorders. Shortcomings include few 
population-based studies, heterogeneous diagnostic criteria and uneven 
representation of countries on the continent. There are important knowledge gaps 
that need urgent action, in order to prepare the sub-continent for the 
anticipated local surge in neurodegenerative diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Timely communication about life expectancy and end-of-life care is 
crucial for ensuring good patient quality-of-life at the end of life and a good 
quality of death. This article describes the protocol for a multisite randomised 
controlled trial of a nurse-led communication support programme to facilitate 
patients' and caregivers' efforts to communicate about these issues with their 
healthcare team.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This NHMRC-sponsored trial is being conducted at medical 
oncology clinics located at/affiliated with major teaching hospitals in Sydney, 
Australia. Patients with advanced, incurable cancer and life expectancy of less 
than 12 months will participate together with their primary informal caregiver 
where possible. Guided by the self-determination theory of health-behaviour 
change, the communication support programme pairs a purpose-designed Question 
Prompt List (QPL-an evidence-based list of questions patients/caregivers can ask 
clinicians) with nurse-led exploration of QPL content, communication challenges, 
patient values and concerns and the value of early discussion of end-of-life 
issues. Oncologists are also cued to endorse patient and caregiver question 
asking and use of the QPL. Behavioural and self-report data will be collected 
from patients/caregivers approximately quarterly for up to 2.5 years or until 
patient death, after which patient medical records will be examined. Analyses 
will examine the impact of the intervention on patients' and caregivers' 
participation in medical consultations, their self-efficacy in medical 
encounters, quality-of-life, end-of-life care receipt and quality-of-death 
indicators.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approvals have been granted by the human ethics review 
committee of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and governance officers at each 
participating site. Results will be reported in peer-reviewed publications and 
conference presentations.

PURPOSE: Life expectancy is used to measure population health, but large 
differences in mortality can be masked even when there is no life expectancy 
gap. We demonstrate how Arriaga's decomposition method can be used to assess 
inequality in mortality between populations with near equal life expectancy.
METHODS: We calculated life expectancy at birth for Quebec and the rest of 
Canada from 2005 to 2009 using life tables and partitioned the gap between both 
populations into age and cause-specific components using Arriaga's method.
RESULTS: The life expectancy gap between Quebec and Canada was negligible 
(<0.1 years). Decomposition of the gap showed that higher lung cancer mortality 
in Quebec was offset by cardiovascular mortality in the rest of Canada, 
resulting in identical life expectancy in both groups. Lung cancer in Quebec had 
a greater impact at early ages, whereas cardiovascular mortality in Canada had a 
greater impact at older ages.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of a gap, we demonstrate using decomposition 
analyses how lung cancer at early ages lowered life expectancy in Quebec, 
whereas cardiovascular causes at older ages lowered life expectancy in Canada. 
We provide SAS/Stata code and an Excel spreadsheeet to facilitate application of 
Arriaga's method to other settings.

BACKGROUND: Long-term prognosis in terms of cognition in young stroke patients 
is very important because these patients usually still have a long life 
expectancy and rather extensive daily life demands. However, little is known on 
cognitive deficits in these patients. We aimed to evaluate cognitive function in 
young stroke patients (<50 years) after long-term follow-up.
METHODS: Young adults with first-ever ischaemic stroke admitted to St. Elisabeth 
Hospital or the TweeSteden Hospital, Tilburg, the Netherlands, between January 
2000 and December 2010 were included. Patients with severe aphasia or 
pre-existent cognitive impairment were excluded. Cognitive functioning was 
assessed using a neuropsychological examination focussing on the following 
cognitive domains: visual perception, visual and verbal memory, mental speed, 
and executive functioning. Raw scores were compared to the scores of 61 controls 
using a multivariate analysis of variance with adjustment for education level.
RESULTS: The 96 participants (median age at index event 43.0 years; 45.8% male) 
performed worse than controls on the Stroop Color-Word Test Part 1 (p < 0.001) 
and on the Symbol-Digit Substitution Task (p < 0.001), both assessing mental 
speed. Patients had significantly lower scores on the learning slope of the Word 
Pair test (p = 0.002) assessing verbal memory. Patients performed better on the 
Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure than controls (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In young patients with ischaemic stroke, mental slowness is present 
even up to 10 years after stroke. When counselling these patients, doctors 
should actively try to assess the presence of cognitive deficits, also after a 
long period of follow-up.

This report describes the epidemiology, economic burden and treatment of 
osteoporosis in Switzerland.
INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and disruption 
of bone architecture, resulting in increased risks of fragility fractures which 
represent the main clinical consequence of the disease. Fragility fractures are 
associated with substantial pain and suffering, disability and even death for 
the affected patients and substantial costs to society. The aim of this report 
is to describe the epidemiology and economic burden of fragility fractures as a 
consequence of osteoporosis in Switzerland, as a detailed addition to the report 
for the European Union (EU27): "Osteoporosis in the European Union: Medical 
Management, Epidemiology and Economic Burden".
METHODS: The literature on fracture incidence and costs of fractures in 
Switzerland was reviewed and incorporated into a model estimating the clinical 
and economic burden of osteoporotic fractures in 2010. Furthermore, data on 
sales of osteoporosis treatments and the population at high risk of fracture 
were used to estimate treatment uptake and treatment gap.
RESULTS: It was estimated that approximately 74,000 new fragility fractures were 
sustained in Switzerland in 2010, comprising 14,000 hip fractures, 11,000 
vertebral fractures, 13,000 forearm fractures and 36,000 other fractures (i.e. 
fractures of the pelvis, rib, humerus, tibia, fibula, clavicle, scapula, sternum 
and other femoral fractures). The economic burden of incident and previous 
fragility fractures was estimated at CHF 2,050 million for the same year. 
Incident fractures represented 76 % of this cost, long-term fracture care 21 % 
and pharmacological prevention 3 %. Previous and incident fractures also 
accounted for 24,000 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost during 2010. When 
accounting for the demographic projections for 2025, the number of incident 
fractures was estimated at 98,786 in 2025, representing an increase of 25,000 
fractures. Hip, clinical vertebral (spine), forearm and other fractures were 
estimated to increase by 4,900, 3,200, 3,500 and 13,000, respectively. The 
burden of fractures in terms of costs (excluding value of QALYs lost) in 
Switzerland in 2025 was estimated to increase by 29 % to CHF 2,642 million. 
Though the uptake of osteoporosis treatments increased from 2001, the proportion 
of patients aged 50 or above who received treatment remained at low levels in 
the past few years. The majority of women at high fracture risk do not receive 
active treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the high cost of osteoporosis, a substantial treatment 
gap and projected increase of the economic burden driven by an aging population, 
the use of pharmacological prevention of osteoporosis is significantly less than 
optimal, suggesting that a change in health care policy concerning the disease 
is warranted.

BACKGROUND: As non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatments improve and 
patients live longer, it is important to develop interventions to help patients 
live fuller lives. We sought to identify key components of quality of life (QOL) 
in determining therapeutic decision making and overall value of life extension 
in patients with NSCLC.
METHODS: Three focus groups (n = 16) and telephone interviews (n = 15) were 
conducted with NSCLC patients (N = 31) to explore symptoms considered important 
to QOL. A trade-off format was used to assess the value of life extension 
relative to QOL. Patients were asked to consider a hypothetical treatment option 
offering a modest (3 month) life extension.
RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 61.6 years, 67.6% were women, 77.4% were white, 
and 48.4% had stage III/IV disease. In all, 68% of patients conceptualized 
emotions as symptoms of NSCLC. Key symptoms changed over time: Patients reported 
feeling shock and fear at diagnosis (74%), and feeling fear or loneliness during 
the beginning of therapy (55%). Additionally, patients who reported successfully 
connecting with other NSCLC patients (peers), support groups, and/or community 
members reported a positive shift in feelings (52%) as they continued therapy or 
moved into a posttherapy phase. Financially, 23% of patients reported being 
adversely affected by copayments, 36% by unexpected gaps in coverage, and 39% by 
other bills. Patients reported that the most important dimension driving their 
decision making about life-extending therapy was somatic (84%), followed by 
functional (32%), relational (23%), and emotional (10%) dimensions.
LIMITATIONS: Study participants were likely to have received some education or 
support from the recruiting cancer advocacy and patient education/support 
organizations. In addition, participants were of a higher socioeconomic status 
than the average lung cancer patient population.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NSCLC conflated emotional well-being after diagnosis 
with symptoms of their cancer and treatment toxicities. Somatic QOL concerns 
emerged ahead of functional, emotional, and relational QOL concerns as the 
dominant driver of therapeutic decision making.

Pirogoff amputation for a bilateral traumatic lower-extremity amputee: 
indication and technique.

Ipaktchi K, Seidl A, Banegas R, Hak D, Mauffrey C.

Although only a small portion of all lower-extremity amputations in the United 
States are of traumatic origin, almost half of all living amputees have 
sustained traumatic amputations. This particular epidemiology is explained by 
the younger age, and thus longer life expectancy, of traumatic amputees. In this 
group especially, restoration and lifelong maintenance of ambulation and 
mobility is essential. The authors present the case of a bilateral traumatic 
lower-leg amputee whose management included a Pirogoff amputation. Although this 
amputation technique is not widely used, the authors believe it greatly 
facilitated stump and soft tissue management in this case and allowed for 
improved mobility. The indication for and technique of Pirogoff amputation are 
described, and a brief overview of amputation techniques in the foot is 
provided.

Modelling outcomes of complex treatment strategies following a clinical 
guideline for treatment decisions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

BACKGROUND: Management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by a 
sequence of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological 
response modifiers (BRMs). In most of the Western countries, the drug sequences 
are determined based on disease activity and treatment history of the patients. 
A model for realistic patient outcomes should reflect the treatment pathways 
relevant for patients with specific characteristics.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at developing a model that could simulate long-term 
patient outcomes and cost effectiveness of treatment strategies with and without 
inclusion of BRMs following a clinical guideline for treatment decisions.
METHODS: Discrete event simulation taking into account patient characteristics 
and treatment history was used for model development. Treatment effect on 
disease activity, costs, health utilities and times to events were estimated 
using Dutch observational studies. Long-term progression of physical functioning 
was quantified using a linear mixed-effects model. Costs and health utilities 
were estimated using two-part models. The treatment strategy recommended by the 
Dutch Society for Rheumatology where both DMARDs and BRMs were available 
(Strategy 2) was compared with the treatment strategy without BRMs (Strategy 1). 
Ten thousand theoretical patients were tracked individually until death. In the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo simulations were performed with 
1,000 sets of parameters sampled from appropriate probability distributions.
RESULTS: The simulated changes over time in disease activity and physical 
functioning were plausible. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained of Strategy 2 compared with Strategy 1 was <euro>124,011. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold higher than <euro>119,167, Strategy 2 dominated 
Strategy 1 in terms of cost effectiveness but the probability that the Strategy 
2 is cost effective never exceeded 0.87.
CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to model the outcomes of complex treatment 
strategies based on a clinical guideline for the management of RA. Following the 
Dutch guideline and using real-life data, inclusion of BRMs in the treatment 
strategy for RA appeared to be less favourable in our model than in most of the 
existing models that compared drug sequences independent of patient 
characteristics and used data from randomised controlled clinical trials. 
Despite complexity and demand for extensive data, our modelling approach can 
help to identify the knowledge gaps in clinical guidelines for RA management and 
priorities for future research.

BACKGROUND: Lifetime risks are often used in communications on cancer to the 
general public. The most-cited estimate for breast cancer risk (1 in 8 women), 
however, appears to be outdated. Here we describe the breast cancer burden in 
the Netherlands over time by means of lifetime and age-conditional risks. The 
aim is to identify changes in absolute risk of primary breast cancer diagnosis 
and death.
METHODS: Data on breast cancer incidence, mortality and size of the female 
population were retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and Statistics 
Netherlands. Lifetime and age-conditional risks were calculated for 1990, 2000 
and 2010 using the life-table method (DevCan software).
RESULTS: The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ 
and invasive) in 1990, 2000 and 2010 was estimated at 10.8 (1 in 9.3 women), 
13.5 (1 in 7.4) and 15.2% (1 in 6.6), respectively. Most women were still 
diagnosed after the age of 50, with the highest risk between 60 and 70 years in 
2010. The lifetime risk of breast cancer death was 3.8% (1 in 27) in 2010, which 
is lower than in 1990 (4.5%; 1 in 22) and 2000 (4.2%; 1 in 24).
CONCLUSION: Breast cancer risk has increased to 1 in 6.6 women being diagnosed 
during their lifetime (invasive cancer only: 1 in 7.4), whereas risk of breast 
cancer death has decreased from 1 in 22 to 1 in 27 women. To keep cancer 
management and prevention up-to-date, it remains important to closely monitor 
the ever-changing breast cancer burden.

OBJECTIVES: This study presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of salt reduction 
policies to lower coronary heart disease in Syria.
METHODS: Costs and benefits of a health promotion campaign about salt reduction 
(HP); labeling of salt content on packaged foods (L); reformulation of salt 
content within packaged foods (R); and combinations of the three were estimated 
over a 10-year time frame. Policies were deemed cost-effective if their 
cost-effectiveness ratios were below the region's established threshold of 
$38,997 purchasing power parity (PPP). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to 
account for the uncertainty in the reduction of salt intake.
RESULTS: HP, L, and R+HP+L were cost-saving using the best estimates. The 
remaining policies were cost-effective (CERs: R=$5,453 PPP/LYG; R+HP=$2,201 
PPP/LYG; R+L=$2,125 PPP/LYG). R+HP+L provided the largest benefit with net 
savings using the best and maximum estimates, while R+L was cost-effective with 
the lowest marginal cost using the minimum estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that all policies were cost-saving or cost 
effective, with the combination of reformulation plus labeling and a 
comprehensive policy involving all three approaches being the most promising 
salt reduction strategies to reduce CHD mortality in Syria.

PURPOSE: We located the instantaneous center of rotation (ICR) for the cervical 
spine at various ages and investigated age-related changes. We evaluated the 
impact of cervical disc degeneration on the ICR using a scoring system based on 
plain radiographs.
METHODS: Flexion, extension, and neutral lateral radiographs were obtained from 
680 asymptomatic subjects (363 men, 317 women; ages 20-79 years) divided into 
six 10-year-age groups. The ICRs from C3/C4 to C6/C7 were determined from the 
radiographs using MIMICS software. A scoring system determined from lateral 
radiographs quantitatively assessed degeneration of cervical intervertebral 
discs. ICRs were compared among groups to analyze age-related changes and the 
relation between degenerative changes and ICR location.
RESULTS: In asymptomatic subjects, the ICR was located approximately at the 
superior half of the lower vertebral body height and the posterior half of its 
width. The ICR at the C5/C6 level was located more anterior and higher in 
patients >50 years than in younger subgroups (P < 0.05). Degenerative changes 
produced more anterosuperior translation of the ICR, which was significantly 
correlated with height loss (P < 0.05). In moderately or severely degenerated 
segments, the ICR location change reached statistical significance (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline data for Chinese cervical spine ICRs were established for 
the third through eighth decade of life, including age-related changes and the 
kinematic effects of degenerative change on the ICR in the functional spine 
unit. These findings should be considered in clinical practice and when 
designing disc prostheses.

Edoxaban versus warfarin for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation: a cost-effectiveness analysis.

University, Milan, Italy.

Edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, has been found non-inferior to 
warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in patients with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), with a lower rate of intracranial 
bleeding. The aim of our investigation was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
edoxaban versus warfarin from the perspective of the Italian health-care system. 
A Markov decision model was used to evaluate lifetime cost and quality-adjusted 
life expectancy of NVAF patients treated with warfarin or edoxaban. Transition 
probabilities were obtained from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, cost estimates 
were based on Italian prices and tariffs, utilities were obtained from the 
literature. One-way and second-order sensitivity analyses were performed. In the 
base case, lifetime costs were €18,658 for edoxaban and €14,060 for warfarin. 
Discounted quality-adjusted survival was 9.022 years for edoxaban and 8.425 
years for warfarin, leading to an incremental cost-utility ratio of €7,713 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results were sensitive to time 
horizon, time in therapeutic range of warfarin and to the relative impact of 
warfarin versus edoxaban therapy onto quality of life. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed edoxaban to be cost-effective versus warfarin in 92.3 % of the 
simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €25,000 per QALY. In 
conclusion, edoxaban proved to be a cost-effective alternative to warfarin in 
patients with moderate-to-high-risk NVAF.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is the main cause of stroke, but the risk can be 
reduced, usually with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin. The RE-LY 
atrial fibrillation study demonstrated that the rates of stroke and systemic 
embolism with dabigatran (an oral direct thrombin inhibitor) were similar to or 
lower than those with warfarin.
AIMS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness, from a French payer perspective, of 
dabigatran (150 or 110mg bid for patients<or≥80 years, respectively) versus 
warfarin.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was modeled using a Markov model in a cohort of 
10,000 patients with atrial fibrillation followed over their lifetime. Events 
accounted for included ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, transient ischemic 
attack, hemorrhage, myocardial infarction and death. The model patient 
population matched the RE-LY patients. Dabigatran was compared with "trial-like" 
warfarin and "real-world" prescribing. Risks of clinical events were obtained 
from RE-LY. Event and follow-up costs were based on the French national tariff 
or published literature. Clinical events, QALYs, total costs and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated.
RESULTS: The ICERs of dabigatran compared with "trial-like" warfarin and 
"real-world" prescribing were €15,838/QALY and €7473/QALY, respectively. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed these to be robust 
to uncertainty and variability in the model parameters. The ICER for dabigatran 
was below €24,000/QALY or €36,000/QALY in 71% or 92%, respectively, of the 
simulations when compared with "trial-like" warfarin and 100% and 100%, 
respectively, when compared with "real-world" prescribing.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the use of dabigatran in French atrial 
fibrillation patients is cost-effective, according to usually accepted 
thresholds.
