motion tracking analysis. Axial stiffness of triangular fixation was 
significantly higher versus posterior sacral plating and spino-pelvic fixation 
(p ≤ 0.022), but not significantly different in comparison to SI-screw fixation 
(p = 0.337). Cycles to 2, 3, 5, and 8 mm fracture displacement, as well as to 
3°, 5°, and 8° gap angle at the fracture site were significantly higher for 
triangular fixation compared to all other groups (p ≤ 0.041). Main failure mode 
for all osteosynthesis techniques was screw cutting through the bone, leading 
loss of fixation stability. From a biomechanical point of view, triangular 
fixation in sacrum Denis type II fractures demonstrated less interfragmentary 
movements and should be considered in unstable fragility fractures of the 
sacrum. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals,

772. Cystic Fibrosis: Diagnosis and management.

National Guideline Alliance (UK).

London: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); 2017 Oct 25.
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence: Guidelines.

Cystic fibrosis is a multi-system genetic disorder affecting the lungs, 
pancreas, liver and intestine. It can have a significant impact on life 
expectancy and quality of life. The current median age of those who have died is 
28 years and the median predicted survival is 45.1 years. Diagnosis is primarily 
made during newborn screening. The median age at diagnosis is 2 months and 1 in 
every 2500 babies born in the UK has cystic fibrosis. Approximately 60% of 
people on the UK CF registry are aged over 16 years. Many different mutations 
are responsible for cystic fibrosis. The UK CF registry shows that 90.8% of 
people with cystic fibrosis have one known genotype. However 8.9% of people have 
at least one unknown genotype. Lung function is often reduced in cystic 
fibrosis. The typical measure of lung function is forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV1). FEV1 is a key predictor of life expectancy in people with cystic 
fibrosis, and optimising lung function is a major goal of care. Lung infections 
are a cause of significant morbidity in cystic fibrosis. Chronic infection (for 
example with Staphlococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) may need long-term 
use of antibiotics. There is variation across the country in the 
multidisciplinary team structures used, the arrangements services make for 
providing care and in the resources available to support services. Particular 
problems may arise with smaller shared-care clinic arrangements. In some 
centres, both inpatient and outpatient facilities are limited. For example, 
there may be problems in arranging admission to single rooms with en-suite 
facilities. If adequate protocols are not in place, then there is a risk of 
cross-infection. By making robust recommendations based on the available 
evidence and best practice in cystic fibrosis care, this guideline will help 
improve care for this highly complex condition.

INTRODUCTION: In the current context of increased life expectancy and 
progressive aging of the population a very significant increase in the number of 
people with cognitive impairment and dementia is expected. Consequently, Spain 
will face an enormous social and health problem in the next decades. The Mapa de 
la enfermedad de Alzheimer y otras demencias en España project aims to analyse 
plans, prevention and early diagnosis activities, process of care and resources 
available across the 17 Spanish regions for the management of cognitive 
impairment and dementia in order to identify improvement areas, as well as to 
provide a list of recommendations.
METHODS: The working group consisted of an Advisory Committee of 5 national 
experts and a Committee of Experts from each region made up of professionals in 
the field of Neurology, Geriatrics, Psychiatry, and Primary Care, as well as 
representatives of Family Associations of People with Alzheimer's and other 
dementias. The Expert Committee of each region held meetings in which the 
current situation of care was reviewed.
RESULTS: Plans available in Spain for dementia management are mostly obsolete or 
have not been implemented. Prevention and early detection activities are 
generally not carried out. There is great variability of care process that 
patients must follow for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of the disease, 
and not all diagnostic test are available in different regions. In general, 
resources are considered scarce and unknown.
CONCLUSIONS: The Mapa de la enfermedad de Alzheimer y otras demencias en España 
study has been able to detect the main points that require changing n the 
management, organisation, and coordination of resources, such as information and 
training of the personnel involved. Furthermore, the study has revealed that, in 
Spain, the necessary conditions are in place in Spain, such as the availability 
and capacity of professionals involved, as well as there being the potential 
diagnostic and health care resources to address this room for improvement 
through the approval and development of a National Alzheimer's Plan, supported 
by a deep and truthful political commitment, which will be the ideal framework 
for the development of these possibilities.

BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is the recommended treatment for patients with advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of 
sorafenib to that of selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 
(90Y) resin microspheres in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
METHODS: SARAH was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, 
investigator-initiated, phase 3 trial done at 25 centres specialising in liver 
diseases in France. Patients were eligible if they were aged at least 18 years 
with a life expectancy greater than 3 months, had an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, Child-Pugh liver function 
class A or B score of 7 or lower, and locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
(Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] stage C), or new hepatocellular carcinoma 
not eligible for surgical resection, liver transplantation, or thermal ablation 
after a previously cured hepatocellular carcinoma (cured by surgery or 
thermoablative therapy), or hepatocellular carcinoma with two unsuccessful 
rounds of transarterial chemoembolisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) 
by a permutated block method with block sizes two and four to receive continuous 
oral sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or SIRT with 90Y-loaded resin microspheres 
2-5 weeks after randomisation. Patients were stratified according to randomising 
centre, ECOG performance status, previous transarterial chemoembolisation, and 
presence of macroscopic vascular invasion. The primary endpoint was overall 
survival. Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population; safety was 
assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of sorafenib or 
underwent at least one of the SIRT work-up exams. This study has been completed 
and the final results are reported here. The trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01482442.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2011, and March 12, 2015, 467 patients were randomly 
assigned; after eight patients withdrew consent, 237 were assigned to SIRT and 
222 to sorafenib. In the SIRT group, 53 (22%) of 237 patients did not receive 
SIRT; 26 (49%) of these 53 patients were treated with sorafenib. Median 
follow-up was 27·9 months (IQR 21·9-33·6) in the SIRT group and 28·1 months 
(20·0-35·3) in the sorafenib group. Median overall survival was 8·0 months (95% 
CI 6·7-9·9) in the SIRT group versus 9·9 months (8·7-11·4) in the sorafenib 
group (hazard ratio 1·15 [95% CI 0·94-1·41] for SIRT vs sorafenib; p=0·18). In 
the safety population, at least one serious adverse event was reported in 174 
(77%) of 226 patients in the SIRT group and in 176 (82%) of 216 in the sorafenib 
group. The most frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were 
fatigue (20 [9%] vs 41 [19%]), liver dysfunction (25 [11%] vs 27 [13%]), 
increased laboratory liver values (20 [9%] vs 16 [7%]), haematological 
abnormalities (23 [10%] vs 30 [14%]), diarrhoea (three [1%] vs 30 [14%]), 
abdominal pain (six [3%] vs 14 [6%]), increased creatinine (four [2%] vs 12 
[6%]), and hand-foot skin reaction (one [<1%] vs 12 [6%]). 19 deaths in the SIRT 
group and 12 in the sorafenib group were deemed to be treatment related.
INTERPRETATION: In patients with locally advanced or intermediate-stage 
hepatocellular carcinoma after unsuccessful transarterial chemoembolisation, 
overall survival did not significantly differ between the two groups. Quality of 
life and tolerance might help when choosing between the two treatments.

BACKGROUND: There is a need for a specific tool that supports healthcare 
professionals in timely identifying people with intellectual disabilities (ID) 
in need of palliative care. Therefore, we developed PALLI: a tool for screening 
deteriorating health, indicative of a limited life expectancy.
AIMS: We evaluated feasibility, construct validity and predictive validity of 
PALLI.
METHODS: 190 people with ID likely to be in need of palliative care were 
included. Physicians and daily care professionals (DCPs) completed PALLI and 
provided information on health outcomes at baseline, after 5-6 months and after 
10-12 months. Linear Mixed Models and Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used 
to test validity.
RESULTS: Feasibility was adequate: physicians and DCPs were able to answer most 
items with 'yes' or 'no' and within a short amount of time. Construct validity 
was promising: a higher PALLI score at baseline was related to a higher level of 
decline in health, a higher symptom burden, a lower quality of life and more 
ADL-dependency at baseline. Predictive validity: only a higher 
physician-reported PALLI score at baseline significantly increased risk of death 
within 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: PALLI shows promising feasibility and validity and has potential as 
a tool for timely identifying people with ID who may benefit from palliative 
care.

BACKGROUND: In cancer patients, malnutrition is associated with treatment 
toxicity, complications, reduced physical functioning, and decreased survival. 
The Prevalence of Malnutrition in Oncology (PreMiO) study identified 
malnutrition or its risk among cancer patients making their first medical 
oncology visit. Innovatively, oncologists, not nutritionists, evaluated the 
nutritional status of the patients in this study.
METHODS: PreMiO was a prospective, observational study conducted at 22 medical 
oncology centers across Italy. For inclusion, adult patients (>18 years) had a 
solid tumor diagnosis, were treatment-naive, and had a life expectancy >3 
months. Malnutrition was identified by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), 
appetite status with a visual analog scale (VAS), and appetite loss with a 
modified version of Anorexia-Cachexia Subscale (AC/S-12) of the Functional 
Assessment of Anorexia-Cachexia Therapy (FAACT).
FINDINGS: Of patients enrolled (N=1,952), 51% had nutritional impairment; 9% 
were overtly malnourished, and 43% were at risk for malnutrition. Severity of 
malnutrition was positively correlated with the stage of cancer. Over 40% of 
patients were experiencing anorexia, as reported in the VAS and FAACT 
questionnaire. During the prior six months, 64% of patients lost weight (1-10 
kg).
INTERPRETATION: Malnutrition, anorexia, and weight loss are common in cancer 
patients, even at their first visit to a medical oncology center.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate donor site morbidity 
after reconstruction of defects in the head and neck region with an 
anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap.
METHODS: From 07/2006 to 12/2015 the anterolateral thigh flap was used for 
reconstruction of large intra- or extraoral defects in 138 patients. The donor 
sites were available to examine for morbidity in 51 patients (36.7%). All 
patients completed a standardized questionnaire, received a physical 
examination, and underwent isokinetic muscle exercises of the lower extremity 
with a Dynamometer.
RESULTS: The average postoperative follow-up was 29 months and showed 
significant donor site morbidity in the form of sensory disturbance as well as 
revealing significant differences in extension and flexion between donor and 
normal thighs in the isokinetic power test. Range of motion at the hip and knee 
was moderately compromised.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that dissection of the 
musculocutaneous perforators can compromise the function of vastus lateralis, 
which is the largest compartment of the quadriceps group. This could also affect 
the antagonistic muscles such as the semitendinosus, semimembranosus and biceps 
femoris. Because of its versatility, adequate tissue stock, possibility of 
simultaneous two-team approach large and long pedicle and minimal donor site 
morbidity, the ALT flap has become one of the most preferred transplants for 
soft tissue reconstruction in the head and neck region. Most authors described 
the donor site morbidity as minimal (Song et al. 1984; Wolff et al., 2006; Xu 
et al., 1988; Kimata et al., 1997; Kuo et al., 2001; Collins et al., 2012). In 
summary, the study shows that functional impairment of the donor thigh can occur 
but does not affect the patients in their daily life.

Sheep have many advantages to study neurogenesis in comparison to the well-known 
rodent models. Their development and life expectancy are relatively long and 
they possess a gyrencephalic brain. Sheep are also seasonal breeders, a 
characteristic that allows studying the involvement of hypothalamic neurogenesis 
in the control of seasonal reproduction. Sheep are also able to individually 
recognize their conspecifics and develop selective and lasting bonds. Adult 
olfactory neurogenesis could be adapted to social behavior by supporting 
recognition of conspecifics. The present review reveals the distinctive features 
of the hippocampal, olfactory, and hypothalamic neurogenesis in sheep. In 
particular, the organization of the subventricular zone and the dynamic of 
neuronal maturation differs from that of rodents. In addition, we show that 
various physiological conditions, such as seasonal reproduction, gestation, and 
lactation differently modulate these three neurogenic niches. Last, we discuss 
recent evidence indicating that hypothalamic neurogenesis acts as an important 
regulator of the seasonal control of reproduction and that olfactory 
neurogenesis could be involved in odor processing in the context of maternal 
behavior.

Molecular engineering to increase the percentage identity to common human 
immunoglobulin sequences of non-human therapeutic antibodies and scaffolds has 
become standard practice. This strategy is often used to reduce undesirable 
immunogenic responses, accelerating the clinical development of candidate 
domains. The first humanized shark variable domain (VNAR) was reported by 
Kovalenko and colleagues and used the anti-human serum albumin (HSA) domain, 
clone E06, as a model to construct a number of humanized versions including 
huE06v1.10. This study extends this work by using huE06v1.10 as a template to 
isolate domains with improved biophysical properties and reduced antigenicity. 
Random mutagenesis was conducted on huE06v1.10 followed by refinement of clones 
through an off-rate ranking-based selection on target antigen. Many of these 
next-generation binders retained high affinity for target, together with good 
species cross-reactivity. Lead domains were assessed for any tendency to 
dimerize, tolerance to N- and C-terminal fusions, affinity, stability, and 
relative antigenicity in human dendritic cell assays. Functionality of candidate 
clones was verified in vivo through the extension of serum half-life in a 
typical drug format. From these analyses the domain, BA11, exhibited negligible 
antigenicity, high stability and high affinity for mouse, rat, and HSA. When 
these attributes were combined with demonstrable functionality in a rat model of 
PK, the BA11 clone was established as our clinical candidate.

BACKGROUND: The response to therapeutics varies widely in patients with 
depression and anxiety, making selection of an optimal treatment choice 
challenging. IDgenetix®, a novel pharmacogenomic test, has been shown to improve 
outcomes by predicting the likelihood of response to different psychotherapeutic 
medications.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of 
implementing a novel pharmacogenomic test (IDgenetix®) to guide treatment 
choices in patients with depression and/or anxiety compared with treatment as 
usual from the US societal perspective.
METHODS: We developed a discrete event simulation to compare clinical events, 
quality-adjusted life-years, and costs of the two treatment strategies. Target 
patients had a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Score ≥ 20 and/or a Hamilton 
Rating Scale for Anxiety score ≥ 18 at baseline. Remission, response, and no 
response were simulated based on the observed rates in the IDgenetix® randomized 
controlled trial. Quality-adjusted life-years and direct and indirect costs 
attributable to depression and anxiety were estimated and compared over a 3-year 
time horizon. We conducted extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The model predicted cumulative remission rates of 78 and 66% in 
IDgenetix® and treatment as usual groups, respectively. Estimated discounted 
quality-adjusted life-years were 2.09 and 1.94 per patient for IDgenetix® and 
treatment as usual, respectively, which resulted in 0.15 incremental 
quality-adjusted life-years (95% credible interval 0.04-0.28). The total costs 
after accounting for a US$2000 test cost were US$14,124 for IDgenetix® compared 
with US$14,659 for treatment as usual, suggesting a US$535 (95% credible 
interval - 2902 to 1692) cost saving per patient in the IDgenetix® group. 
Incremental quality-adjusted life-year gain (0.49) and cost savings (US$6800) 
were substantially larger in patients with severe depression (Hamilton Rating 
Scale for Depression score ≥ 25).
CONCLUSION: Using the IDgenetix® test to guide the treatment of patients with 
depression and anxiety may be a dominant strategy, as it improves 
quality-adjusted life-years and decreases overall costs over a 3-year time 
horizon.

This study used non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) 
neuroimaging to monitor bilateral sensorimotor region activation during 
unilateral voluntary (VOL) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation 
(NMES)-evoked movements.
METHODS: In eight healthy male volunteers, fNIRS was used to measure relative 
changes in oxyhaemoglobin (O2 Hb) and deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb) concentrations from 
a cortical sensorimotor region of interest in the left (LH) and right (RH) 
hemispheres during NMES-evoked and VOL wrist extension movements of the right 
arm.
RESULTS: NMES-evoked movements induced significantly greater activation 
(increase in O2 Hb and concomitant decrease in HHb) in the contralateral LH than 
in the ipsilateral RH (O2 Hb: 0·44 ± 0·16 μM and 0·25 ± 0·22 μM, P = 0·017; HHb: 
-0·19 ± 0·10 μM and -0·12 ± 0·09 μM, P = 0·036, respectively) as did VOL 
movements (0·51 ± 0·24 μΜ and 0·34 ± 0·21 μM, P = 0·031; HHb: -0·18 ± 0·07 μΜ 
and -0·12 ± 0·04 μΜ, P = 0·05, respectively). There was no significant 
difference between conditions for O2 Hb (P = 0·144) and HHb (P = 0·958).
CONCLUSION: fNIRS neuroimaging enables quantification of bilateral sensorimotor 
regional activation profiles during voluntary and NMES-evoked wrist extension 
movements.

BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by high functional disability and rapidly progressive dependency. 
The predictors of survival are still unclear.
METHODS: The predictors of survival were evaluated in a group of clinically 
diagnosed PSP patients, focusing primarily on extensive cognitive assessment.
RESULTS: The mean survival time from symptom onset was 8.25±3.0years. Sex, age 
at onset, education, occupation and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms did not 
correlate with survival. The only factor associated with a shorter life 
expectancy in our cohort was the presence of dementia at diagnosis. Impairment 
of executive functions was the best predictor of an unfavorable outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that dementia and executive functions need to 
be evaluated in order to define survival probability in PSP patients.

BACKGROUND: To date, the burden of cancer among young adults has rarely been 
studied in depth. Our aim was to describe the scale and profile of cancer 
incidence and mortality worldwide among 20-39 year-olds, highlighting major 
patterns by age, sex, development level, and geographical region.
METHODS: We did a population-based study to quantify the burden of young adult 
cancers worldwide. We defined young adult cancers as those occurring between the 
ages of 20 and 39 years because these individuals will have passed puberty and 
adolescence, but not yet experienced the effects of hormonal decline, immune 
response deterioration, or organ dysfunction associated with chronic health 
conditions. Global, regional, and country-specific (n=184) data estimates of the 
number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths that occurred in 2012 
among young adults were extracted in four 5-year bands from the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer's GLOBOCAN 2012 for all cancers combined and for 
27 major types as defined by the International Classification of Disease, tenth 
revision. We report the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths 
overall and by sex alongside corresponding age-standardised rates (ASR) per 
100 000 people per year. We also present results using four levels of the Human 
Development Index (HDI; low [least developed], medium, high, and very high [most 
developed]), which is a composite indicator for socioeconomic development 
comprising life expectancy, education, and gross national income.
FINDINGS: 975 396 new cancer cases and 358 392 cancer-associated deaths occurred 
among young adults worldwide in 2012, which equated to an ASR of 43·3 new cancer 
cases per 100 000 people per year and 15·9 cancer-associated deaths per 100 000 
people per year. The burden was disproportionally greater among women and the 
most common cancer types overall in terms of new cases were female breast 
cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, leukaemia, and colorectal cancer; in 
terms of deaths, female breast cancer, liver cancer, leukaemia, and cervical 
cancer were the main contributors. When assessed by development level and 
geographical region, the cancer profile varied substantially; generally, the 
burden of infection-associated cancers was greater in regions under transition. 
Cancer incidence was elevated in very high-HDI regions compared with low-HDI 
regions (ASR 64·5 vs 46·2 cancer cases per 100 000 people per year); however, 
the mortality burden was 3 times higher in low-HDI regions (ASR 25·4 vs 9·2 
cancer-associated deaths per 100 000 people per year), reflecting differences in 
cancer profiles and inferior outcomes.
INTERPRETATION: The global cancer burden among 20-39 year-olds differs from that 
seen in younger or older ages and varies substantially by age, sex, development 
level, and geographical region. Although the cancer burden is lower in this age 
group than that observed in older ages, the societal and economic effects remain 
great given the major effects of premature morbidity and mortality. Targeted 
surveillance, prevention, and treatment are needed to reduce the cancer burden 
in this underserved age group.

OBJECTIVE: Older women undergoing regular mammography experience significant 
reductions in breast cancer mortality, except in women with severe comorbidities 
or limited life expectancy. Optimizing screening strategies requires informed 
discussions of benefits and risks given each woman's health status.
CONCLUSION: This article will review the benefits and risks of screening 
mammography in women older than 75 years within the context of life expectancy 
and comorbidities and summarize the current recommendations from professional 
organizations for screening mammography in older women.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of age at initiation and interval of cervical 
cancer screening in women of reproductive age on the risk of future preterm 
birth and subsequent adverse neonatal outcome relative to maternal life-years 
gained and cost of both screening and preterm birth.
METHODS: In this decision and cost-effectiveness analysis, we compared eight 
cytology-based screening programs varying in age of onset (21, 24, 25, 27, or 30 
years) and screening interval (3 or 5 years) in a fictive cohort of 100,000 
women. We used the microsimulation screening analysis model to estimate number 
of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia diagnoses, large loop excisions of the 
transformation zone (LLETZs), life-years gained, cervical cancer cases, deaths, 
and costs of screening and treatment. We used the number of LLETZs to calculate 
additional preterm births, subsequent neonatal morbidity, mortality, and 
associated costs.
RESULTS: The number of LLETZs per 100,000 women varied from 9,612 for the most 
intensive screening (every 3 years from age 21 years) to 4,646 for the least 
intensive screening (every 5 years from age 30 years). Compared with the least 
intensive program, the most intensive program increased maternal life-years 
gained by 9% (10,728 compared with 9,839), decreased cervical cancer cases by 
67% (52 compared with 158), and cervical cancer deaths by 75% (four compared 
with 16) at the expense of 250% (158 compared with 45) more preterm births and 
320% (four compared with one) more neonatal deaths while increasing total costs 
by $55 million ($77 compared with $23 million). The number of maternal 
life-years gained per additional preterm birth varied from 68 to 258 with 
subsequent total costs per maternal life-years gained of $7,212 and $2,329.
CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer screening every 3 years and subsequent treatment in 
women aged younger than 30 years yield limited life-years but may have 
substantial perinatal adverse effects. Consequently, women who plan to have 
children may benefit from a more cautious screening approach, taking into 
account their risk for both cancer and preterm birth.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second 
most common cause of cancer deaths for women. In the present study, we examined 
the trend of premature mortality due to breast cancer among Canadian women from 
1980 through 2010 and proposed a new measure of lifespan shortening.
METHODS: Mortality data for female breast cancer was obtained from the World 
Health Organization mortality database. Years of life lost (YLL) was estimated 
using Canadian life tables. Average lifespan shortened (ALSS) that is calculated 
and expressed by a ratio of YLL relative to expected lifespan.
RESULTS: Over this study period, age-standardized rates of breast cancer 
mortality adjusted to World Standard Population decreased by 40% from 23.2 to 
14.2 per 100 000 women. The adjusted YLL rates fell from 5.3 years per 1000 
women to 3.3 years. On average women with breast cancer died 20.8 years prior to 
expected death in 1980 and 18.3 years early in 2010. A novel measure of lifespan 
shortening, the ALSS decreased from one-fourth of the lifespan in 1980 to 
one-fifth in 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports that among Canadian women with breast cancer, a 
smaller proportion of life was lost on average at the end of the study period. 
The 'life lost' measures presented in this study would be useful tools to 
monitor the pattern of premature mortality for chronic conditions. These 
measures gauge the effectiveness of the health system with respect to early 
detection and treatment.

Laboratory , Livermore, California 94550, United States.

We present a new force field and development scheme for atomistic simulations of 
materials under extreme conditions. These models, which explicitly include two- 
and three-body interactions, are generated by fitting linear combinations of 
Chebyshev polynomials through force matching to trajectories from Kohn-Sham 
density functional theory (DFT). We apply our method to liquid carbon near the 
diamond/graphite/liquid triple point and at higher densities and temperatures, 
where metallization and many-body effects may be substantial. We show that 
explicit inclusion of three-body interaction terms allows our model to yield 
improved descriptions of both dynamic and structural properties over previous 
empirical potential efforts, while exhibiting transferability to nearby state 
points. The simplicity of our functional form and subsequent efficiency of 
parameter determination allow for extension of DFT to experimental time and 
length scales while retaining most of its accuracy.

Corneal endothelial cells (CECs) are essential for maintaining the clarity of 
the cornea. Because CECs have limited proliferative ability, interest is growing 
in their potentially therapeutic regeneration from pluripotent stem cells. 
However, the molecular mechanisms of human CEC differentiation remain largely 
unknown. To determine the key regulators of CEC characteristics, here we 
generated a comprehensive promoter-level expression profile of human CECs, using 
cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) with a single molecule sequencer. 
Integration with the FANTOM5 promoter-level expression atlas, which includes 
transcriptome profiles of various human tissues and cells, enabled us to 
identify 45 promoters at 28 gene loci that are specifically expressed in CECs. 
We further discovered that the expression of transcription factor POU class 6 
homeobox 2 (POU6F2) is restricted to CECs, and upregulated during human CEC 
differentiation, suggesting that POU6F2 is pivotal to terminal differentiation 
of CECs. These CEC-specific promoters would be useful for the assessment of 
fully differentiated CECs derived from pluripotent stem cells. These findings 
promote the development of corneal regenerative medicine.

OBJECTIVE: Saudi demographic composition has changed because of increased life 
expectancy and decreased fertility rates. Little data are available about health 
conditions among older adults in Saudi Arabia, who are expected to represent 20% 
of the population by 2050. The study aim was to assess the prevalence and risk 
factors for chronic conditions among older Saudi men.
METHODS: The sample pertained to 400 men (age ≥55 years) from Buraidah,
