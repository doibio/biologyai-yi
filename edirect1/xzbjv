OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) on quality of 
life in symptomatic and asymptomatic women.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study in a general population of adult 
women. Symptomatic and asymptomatic women with POP were studied. Symptomatic 
women were defined as those who reported the presence/feeling of 
lump/bulge/pressure in the vagina and on vaginal examination had the sign of POP 
defined as the leading edge of the vagina wall/cervix presenting at or beyond 
the hymeneal remnants. All women were asked to self-complete the Prolapse 
Quality of life questionnaire (P-QOL) to estimate the disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) lost due to symptomatic POP. DALYs for a symptomatic POP were 
calculated as the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) 
in the population and the years lost due to disability (YLD). To determinate the 
optimal threshold of each P-QOL domain in relationship to the symptomatic POP 
population a receiver operating curve (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) analysis 
were used.
RESULTS: A total of 785 were recruited. Only 539 (68.7%) consented to 
participate in the study. The mean age was 47 years (range 18-82 years). The 
total scores for each of the P-QOL domains were found to be significantly higher 
in symptomatic prolapse subjects compared to asymptomatic subjects (p<0.05). 
Estimated DALY lost per year per 1000 women obtained were 217.0 vs 324.8, lost 
years of 14.5 vs 10.3 in 50 vs 60-year old women.
CONCLUSION: In this group of women with POP the quality of life is severely 
affected. The DALYs revealed lost years due to symptomatic POP.

address: mrich@wustl.edu.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is extremely common in older adults and 
the potential benefits of secondary prevention are perhaps greater in this 
population than in younger patients. While there is good evidence that secondary 
prevention efforts are justified in patients up to 80 years of age, limited data 
are available on secondary prevention in octogenarians and there is no evidence 
to guide treatment in patients ≥90 years of age. Further, the value of secondary 
prevention may be confounded by prevalent comorbidities, polypharmacy, and 
limited life expectancy. It is therefore essential that all management decisions 
be made in relation to individual preferences and goals of care, with 
understanding by patients that benefits as well as risks may increase with age. 
Furthermore, research is needed to refine markers to better delineate which 
older adults are most likely to benefit from preventive therapies.

BACKGROUND: The 2012 European guidelines recommend statins for intermediate-risk 
individuals with elevated cholesterol levels. Improved discrimination of 
intermediate-risk individuals is needed to prevent both cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and statin side-effects (e.g. myopathy) efficiently since only 3-15 in 
every 100 individuals actually experience a cardiovascular event in the next 10 
years. We estimated the potential cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical test 
which helps to determine which individuals will benefit from statins.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Prognosis of different age- and gender-specific cohorts 
with an intermediate risk was simulated with a Markov model to estimate the 
potential costs and quality-adjusted life-years for four strategies: treat all 
with statins, treat none with statins, treat according to the European 
guidelines, or use a test to select individuals for statin treatment. The 
test-first strategy dominated the other strategies if the hypothetical test was 
100% accurate and cost no more than €237. This strategy and the treat-all 
strategy were equally effective but the test generated lower costs by reducing 
statin usage and side-effects. The treat-none strategy was the least effective 
strategy. Threshold analyses show that the test must be highly accurate 
(especially sensitive) and inexpensive to be the most cost-effective strategy, 
since myopathy has a negligible impact on cost-effectiveness and statin costs 
are low.
CONCLUSION: Use of a highly accurate prognostic test could reduce overall CVD 
risk, frequency of drug side-effects and lifetime costs. However, no additional 
test would add usefully to risk prediction over SCORE when it does not satisfy 
the costs and accuracy requirements.

OBJECTIVES: To determine estimates of the incidence and prevalence of traumatic 
spinal cord injury (TSCI) in Australia as of June 30, 2011.
DESIGN: Population modeling using cohort survival.
SETTING: Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: Hospital data regarding people with TSCI in Australia.
INTERVENTIONS: Modeling using the following data: 2 population-based databases 
of hospital separations of patients with TSCI, giving upper and lower estimates 
of incidence; national population profiles and life tables; levels of TSCI based 
on Australian Spinal Cord Injury Registry; and life expectancy for persons with 
spinal cord injury under 3 scenarios--1 constant and 2 with a trend standardized 
mortality ratio (SMR).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age- and sex-specific incidence and prevalence estimates.
RESULTS: The lower estimate of incidence was 21.0 per million population per 
year, and the upper estimate was 32.3 per million population per year. The 
derived prevalence rates ranged from 490 per million population (10,944 
persons--lower incidence, trend SMR with survival from 1948) up to 886 per 
million population (19,784 persons--higher incidence, constant SMR). The 
prevalence was highest in males, persons aged 46 to 60 years, and those with 
tetraplegia.
CONCLUSIONS: We have reported a method for calculating an estimate of the 
prevalence of TSCI which provides information that will be vital to optimize 
health care planning for this group of highly disabled members of society.

Although many countries' populations have experienced increasing life expectancy 
in recent decades, quality of life (QoL) trends in the general population have 
yet to be investigated. This paper investigates whether QoL changed for the 
general Dutch population over the period 2001-2008. A beta regression model was 
employed to address specific features of the QoL distribution (i.e., 
boundedness, skewness, and heteroskedasticity), as well non-linear age and time 
trends. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) was calculated by combining 
model estimates of mean QoL with mortality rates provided by Statistics 
Netherlands. Changes in QALE were decomposed into those changes caused by QoL 
changes and those caused by mortality-rate changes. The results revealed a 
significant increase in QoL over 2001-2008 for both genders and most ages. For 
example, QALE for a man/woman aged 20 was found to have increased by 2.3/1.9 
healthy years, of which 0.6/0.8 was due to QoL improvements.

AIM: To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of prolonged-release 
oxycodone/naloxone (OXN PR) and its impact on quality of life (QoL), in patients 
with moderate-to-severe cancer pain.
METHODS: This was an open-label extension (OLE) of a 4 week, randomized, 
double-blind (DB) study in which patients with moderate-to-severe cancer pain 
had been randomized to OXN PR or oxycodone PR (OxyPR). During the OLE phase, 
patients were treated with OXN PR capsules (≤ 20/60 mg/day) for ≤ 24 weeks. 
Outcome measures included safety, efficacy and QoL.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients entered the OLE, average pain 
scores based on the modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form were low and stable 
over the 24-week period. The improvement in bowel function and constipation 
symptoms as measured by the Bowel Function Index and patient assessment of 
constipation in patients treated with OXN PR during the 4-week DB study was 
maintained. In patients treated with OxyPR during the DB phase, bowel function 
and constipation symptoms were improved during the OLE. In the DB and in the 
OLE, health status and QoL were similar for patients treated with OXN PR and 
OxyPR. There were no unexpected safety or tolerability issues.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate-to-severe cancer pain, long-term use of 
OXN PR is well tolerated and effective, resulting in sustained analgesia, 
improved bowel function and improved symptoms of constipation.

Rate of force development (RFD) plays an important role when performing rapid 
and forceful movements. Cold-induced afferent input with transient skin cooling 
(SC) can modulate neural drive. However, the relationship between RFD and SC is 
unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether SC increases RFD 
during isometric knee extension. Fifteen young healthy men (25 ± 8 yrs old) 
contracted their quadriceps muscle as fast and forcefully as possible with or 
without SC. Skin cooling was administered to the front of the thigh. Torque and 
electromyographic activity were measured simultaneously. Peak torque was not 
affected by SC. Skin cooling induced a significant increase in RFD at the phase 
0-30 and 0-50 ms. The root mean square of the electromyography of vastus 
medialis, rectus femoris and vastus lateralis at the phases 0-30-50-100 ms 
increased significantly or tended to increase with SC. These results suggest 
that SC may increase neural drive and improve RFD in the very early phases of 
contraction.

e della Scienza, Turin, Italy, paola.bertapelle.neurouro@gmail.com.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative cost-effectiveness of two therapeutic 
strategies: one starting with sacral neuromodulation (SNM) versus one starting 
with Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) for the management of refractory incontinent 
idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) patients, from the perspective of the 
Italian National Health Service (INHS).
METHODS: Direct medical costs (<euro>2011) and benefits (quality-adjusted life 
years-QALYs) were assessed over a ten-year time frame adapting to the Italian 
practice a published Markov model. Clinical inputs were based on the published 
literature and on the expert opinion. Resource consumption rates were provided 
by clinical experts; unit costs were collected from a single hospital accounting 
and from standard tariff lists and public prices. Interventional procedures and 
management of adverse events were costed through a micro-costing approach. The 
primary outcome was incremental costs per QALYs gained (i.e. differential costs 
divided by differential benefits). Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic (PSA) 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: Starting with SNM appears to be cost effective (i.e. under 
<euro>40.000/QALY) from year three (<euro>21,259/QALY) onwards and becomes 
dominant (i.e. more effective and less costly) at year ten: cumulative costs 
were <euro>32,975 for early SNM and <euro>33,309 for early BTX-A, while 
cumulative QALYs were 7.52 and 6.93, respectively. At year ten, DSA suggests the 
results robustness and 99.8 % of the PSA iterations fell within the 
cost-effectiveness threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: A therapeutic strategy starting with SNM may be considered cost 
effective in the midterm and cost saving in the long-term treatment of 
idiopathic OAB from the INHS perspective.

[The medical demographic situation in the Republic of Altai].

[Article in Russian]

Pisareva LF, Odintsova IN, Ananina OA, Khriyapenkov AV, Doctorova EE.

The demographic situation impacts the level of morbidity indirectly. The 
evaluation of demographic situation if the Republic of Altai was made. In 2010, 
in the ethnic structure of population the percentage of Russians reduced up to 
55.7% and of indigenous population increased up to 35.3%. In the Republic 
positive dynamics of population size is preserved. More than 3/5 of population 
live in rural territories. The main factor of increase of population size is its 
natural growth (11 per 1000 of population). The high level of natal V.M.ity and 
low death rate are observed. In the age structure of population percentage of 
persons younger than able-bodied age (25.8%) is larger than in persons of older 
than able-bodied age (15.4%). The tendency of decreasing of percentage of 
persons younger than able-bodied age and persons of able-bodied age is marked. 
The process of aging of population is expressed in deterioration of ratio 
between age groups younger than able-body age and groups of able-bodied age. The 
low indicator of life expectancy of population if noted. The neoplasms are at 
third place among causes of death (140.6 per 100 000 of population) after 
diseases of cardiovascular system and traumas and intoxications. In the 
structure of disability neoplasms are at second place (12.3%) after diseases of 
cardiovascular system. The demographic situation has to be taken into account in 
the process of organization of medical care of population.

Cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir in the treatment of patients with hepatitis C.

Leleu H(1), Blachier M, Rosa I.

(1)Public health expertise, Paris, France.

In France, 190,306 patients were suffering from chronic hepatitis C in 2012. 
These patients have a decreased life expectancy and are susceptible to 
complications associated with chronic hepatitis. Current treatments are poorly 
tolerated and their effectiveness varies depending on the genotype of the virus. 
Sofosbuvir, a new class of treatment, has demonstrated in five phase III trials 
sustained viral response (SVR) rates of over 90% across genotypes, higher than 
current treatments and has a tolerance profile similar to placebo. The objective 
was to determine the cost-effectiveness of using sofosbuvir in the treatment of 
chronic HCV infection. A Markov model was used to compare treatment strategies 
with and without sofosbuvir. The model simulated the natural history of HCV 
infection. SVR rates were based on data from clinical trials. Utilities 
associated with different stages of disease were based on data from the 
literature. French direct medical costs were used. Price for sofosbuvir was the 
price used in the early access program for severe fibrosis stages. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for sofosbuvir versus current reference 
treatments was € 16,278/QALY and varied from 40,000 €/QALY for F0 stages to 
12,080 €/QALY for F4 stages. The sensitivity analyses carried out confirmed the 
robustness of this result. Sofosbuvir is a cost-effective treatment option for 
patients with hepatitis C.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of panitumumab plus mFOLFOX6 
(oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin) compared with bevacizumab plus 
mFOLFOX6 in first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC).
DESIGN: A semi-Markov model was constructed from a French health collective 
perspective, with health states related to first-line treatment 
(progression-free), disease progression with and without subsequent active 
treatment, resection of metastases, disease-free after successful resection and 
death.
METHODS: Parametric survival analyses of patient-level progression-free and 
overall survival data from the only head-to-head clinical trial of panitumumab 
and bevacizumab (PEAK) were performed to estimate transitions to disease 
progression and death. Additional data from PEAK informed the amount of each 
drug consumed, duration of therapy, subsequent therapy use, and toxicities 
related to mCRC treatment. Literature and French public data sources were used 
to estimate unit costs associated with treatment and duration of subsequent 
active therapies. Utility weights were calculated from patient-level data from 
panitumumab trials in the first-, second- and third-line settings. A life-time 
perspective was applied. Scenario, one-way, and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Based on a head-to-head clinical trial that demonstrates better 
efficacy outcomes for patients with wild-type RAS mCRC who receive panitumumab 
plus mFOLFOX6 versus bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6, the incremental cost per 
life-year gained was estimated to be €26,918, and the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was estimated to be €36,577. 
Sensitivity analyses indicate the model is robust to alternative parameters and 
assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost per QALY gained indicates that panitumumab 
plus mFOLFOX6 represents good value for money in comparison to bevacizumab plus 
mFOLFOX6 and, with a willingness-to-pay ranging from €40,000 to €60,000, can be 
considered cost-effective in first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS 
mCRC.

The ins and outs of the evolutionary origin of teeth.

The role of teeth and jaws, as innovations that underpinned the evolutionary 
success of living jawed vertebrates, is well understood, but their evolutionary 
origins are less clear. The origin of teeth, in particular, is mired in 
controversy with competing hypotheses advocating their origin in external dermal 
denticles ("outside-in") versus a de novo independent origin ("inside-out"). No 
evidence has ever been presented demonstrating materially the traditional 
"outside-in" theory of teeth evolving from dermal denticles, besides 
circumstantial evidence of a commonality of structure and organogenesis, and 
phylogenetic evidence that dermal denticles appear earlier in vertebrate 
phylogeny that do teeth. Meanwhile, evidence has mounted in support of 
"inside-out" theory, through developmental studies that have indicated that 
endoderm is required for tooth development, and fossil studies that have shown 
that tooth-like structures evolved before dermal denticles (conodont dental 
elements), that tooth replacement evolving before teeth (thelodont pharyngeal 
denticles), and that teeth evolved many times independently through co-option of 
such structures. However, the foundations of "inside-out" theory have been 
undermined fatally by critical reanalysis of the evidence on which it was based. 
Specifically, it has been shown that teeth develop from dermal, endodermal or 
mixed epithelia and, therefore, developmental distinctions between teeth and 
dermal denticles are diminished. Furthermore the odontode-like structure of 
conodont elements has been shown to have evolved independently of dermal and 
internal odontodes. The tooth-like replacement encountered in thelodont 
pharyngeal odontodes has been shown to have evolved independently of teeth and 
tooth replacement and teeth have been shown to have evolved late within the 
gnathostome stem lineage indicating that it is probable, if not definitive, that 
teeth evolved just once in gnathostome evolution. Thus, the "inside-out" 
hypothesis must be rejected. The phylogenetic distribution of teeth and dermal 
denticles shows that these odontodes were expressed first in the dermal 
skeleton, but their topological distribution extended internally in association 
with oral, nasal and pharyngeal orifices, in a number of distinct evolutionary 
lineages. This suggests that teeth and oral and pharyngeal denticles emerged 
phylogenetically through extension of odontogenic competence from the external 
dermis to internal epithelia. Ultimately, internal and external odontodes appear 
to be distinct developmental modules in living jawed vertebrates, however, the 
evidence suggests that this distinction was not established until the evolution 
of jawed vertebrates, not merely gnathostomes.

BACKGROUND: Age is considered an important risk factor for Parkinson's disease 
(PD). However, although life-expectancy has increased considerably, incidence 
rates of PD appeared to be stable over the last two decades. Accordingly, an 
increase in mean age at onset over time could be expected. We investigated the 
changes in age at onset in PD over the last two decades.
METHODS: All consecutive PD patients assessed over a 18-year period (1995-2013) 
in a single tertiary outpatient clinic were included in the present 
retrospective cohort study.
RESULTS: After adjusting for several confounders (gender, positive family 
history for PD, education, smoking at onset and past exposure to 
environmental/occupational pollutants), 5-year cohorts of year of disease onset 
were associated with increasing age at onset in both prevalent (N = 6996) and 
incident (N = 4172) cases (for trend, P < 0.001). From 1995-2000 to 2010-2013 
there was an increase in predicted age of 4.1 years (95% CI, 3.0-5.2) and 3.9 
years (95% CI, 2.7-5.1) in prevalent and incident cases, respectively. However, 
the change in predicted age at PD onset, across cohorts of year at onset, showed 
a steeper increase than the corresponding sex and cohort-matched mean age from 
the official Italian statistics.
CONCLUSIONS: Over the last two decades, age at onset of PD appeared to shift 
progressively towards more advanced age. However, sequential, high-quality 
population-based incidence studies are required. To establish whether there is a 
trend towards increase in age at onset over and above general population ageing 
and to assess whether the increase is associated with improved medical and 
socio-economic conditions.

Venous invasion is a common characteristic of renal cell carcinoma, manifesting 
as tumor thrombus with possible extension into the renal vein and, in extensive 
cases, the thrombus can reach from the renal vein to the right atrium. 
Currently, cytoreductive nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy are the foundations 
for improving quality of life and survival in the treatment of renal cell 
carcinoma, and a role has emerged for a vascular specialist to become an 
integral part of operative planning and therapy.

Stereotypes Can "Get Under the Skin": Testing a Self-Stereotyping and 
Psychological Resource Model of Overweight and Obesity.

The authors draw upon social, personality, and health psychology to propose and 
test a self-stereotyping and psychological resource model of overweight and 
obesity. The model contends that self-stereotyping depletes psychological 
resources, namely self-esteem, that help to prevent overweight and obesity. In 
support of the model, mediation analysis demonstrates that adult Hispanics who 
highly self-stereotype had lower levels of self-esteem than those who 
self-stereotype less, which in turn predicted higher levels of body mass index 
(overweight and obesity levels). Furthermore, the model did not hold for the 
referent sample, White participants, and an alternative mediation model was not 
supported. These data are the first to theoretically and empirically link 
self-stereotyping and self-esteem (a psychological resource) with a strong 
physiological risk factor for morbidity and short life expectancy in stigmatized 
individuals. Thus, this research contributes to understanding ethnic-racial 
health disparities in the United States and beyond.

Increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates for patients with 
schizophrenia are reported to contribute to their reduced life expectancy. 
Common reasons for increased cardiac mortality rates include cigarette smoking, 
obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and poorer health behavior in general. The 
majority of excess mortality among people with schizophrenia is caused by 
cardiovascular complications. Reduced vagal activity might be one important 
mechanism leading to this increased cardiac mortality and has been consistently 
described in patients and their healthy first-degree relatives. In this case 
study, we compared two different aerobic exercise regimes in one patient with 
chronic schizophrenia to investigate their effects on cardiovascular regulation. 
The patient completed a 6-week period of moderate continuous training (CT) 
followed by a 6-week period of interval training (IT), each regime two times per 
week, on a stationary bicycle. This was followed by a 6-week period of 
detraining. Primary outcome measures examined heart rate (HR) and heart rate 
variability (HRV) at rest while secondary measures assessed fitness parameters 
such as the ventilatory threshold 1 (VT1). We observed that IT was far more 
effective than moderate CT in increasing HRV, as indicated by root mean of 
squared successive difference (improvement to baseline 27 versus 18%), and 
reducing resting HR (-14 versus 0%). Improvement in VT1 (21 versus -1%) was only 
observed after IT. Our study provides preliminary data that the type of 
intervention is highly influential for improving cardiac function in patients 
with schizophrenia. While cardiovascular function might be influenced by CT to 
some degree, no such effect was present in this patient with schizophrenia. In 
addition, the beneficial effect of IT on HR regulation vanished completely after 
a very short period of detraining after the intervention.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy and changes in lifestyle have led to 
prevalence of non-communicable diseases including diabetes whose treatment and 
care requires effective teamwork. This study was conducted to examine the effect 
of inter-professional education on performance and diabetes care knowledge of 
health care teams.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was performed as an 
inter-professional education on 6 healthcare teams (34 people) based on Kolb's 
Learning Cycle and consisted of a set of training activities to improve 
individual, group, and inter-professional capabilities of members of the health 
care team. The pre- and post-tests included Team Climate Inventory (TCI) and a 
knowledge assessment tool performed before the workshop and 3 months later.
RESULTS: Mean scores for knowledge of health care team before intervention and 3 
months later were 7.06 ± 1.04 and 7.97 ± 0.97 out of 10, respectively, that 
showed a significant difference (P < 0.0001). Mean score of the pre-test and 
post-test for inter-professional performance comprised 47.03 ± 6.7 and 49.44 ± 
5.54 out of 70, respectively, which did not show any significant difference. 
However, these mean scores had a significant difference for the domains of 
knowledge and exercising objectives of the teamwork (10.62 ± 1.37 and 11.41 ± 
1.76 out of 15, respectively) (P = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: It seems that inter-professional education can improve the quality 
of health care to some extent through influencing knowledge and collaborative 
performance of health care teams. It also can make the health-related messages 
provided to the covered population more consistent in addition to enhancing 
self-confidence of the personnel.

Baltimore, MD.

BACKGROUND: Biliary atresia (BA) is the leading cause of pediatric end-stage 
liver disease and liver transplantation in the United States. Early diagnosis 
leads to improved outcomes, but diagnosis is often delayed, leading to increased 
rates of transplantation and mortality.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the natural history and 
transplant-related outcomes of patients with BA in a US cohort studied for 20 
years. Data regarding proportions of individuals in different health states, 
including transplant and death, were obtained from published literature. Costs 
were derived from the literature and the Johns Hopkins database of charges using 
the cost-to-charge ratio. Strategy A represented the status quo and assumed no 
screening. Strategy B used nationwide screening with the stool color card 
developed by the Taiwan Health Bureau. The cost associated with both strategies 
was compared with the number of life-years gained, deaths, and the number of 
transplants for a 20-year interval. A dominant strategy was one that was 
associated with lower cost alongside improved outcomes, including increases in 
life-years gained, reductions in number of deaths, and reductions in number of 
transplants. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In strategy A, the 20-year cost was $142,479,725 with 3702 life-years, 
74 deaths and 158 liver transplants. For strategy B, the cost was $133,893,563 
with 3731.7 life-years, 71 deaths and 147 liver transplants. There was a >97% 
probability that screening with the stool color card would be cost saving and 
associated with an increase in life-years gained. Among all parameters, only 
stool color card specificity was associated with the potential for screening to 
no longer be cost saving.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with no screening, screening with the stool color card is 
a dominant strategy associated with lower costs and better outcomes. These 
findings suggest that screening with the stool color card could be an important, 
economically feasible strategy for improving outcomes in BA in the United 
States.

Cervical cancer is the commonest malignancy of women in economically emerging 
countries. Patients have distressing symptoms from presentation through 
follow-up or end of life. Cervical cancer imposes significant burden on health 
care system due to distressing symptoms and associated loss of quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY). Multitude of drugs and surgical measures in various 
combinations can relieve these distressing symptoms and various clinical 
conditions. The protocols and guidelines for alleviation or relief of symptoms 
by general pharmacological and surgical measures form an important policy 
subject in planning cervical cancer management program. These protocol and 
guidelines are based on the mechanism of action of drugs, extrapolation from 
management of similar symptoms, and clinical situations arising out of other 
non-cancerous conditions and experience of health care professionals. Therefore, 
rigorous evaluation of effectiveness of supportive health care services in 
developing countries is the need of hour. However, evaluation of such protocol 
and guidelines are not feasible in emerging economies due to resource 
constraint. Industrialized affluent nations are also not able to implement and 
further support care guidelines despite its recognition as an integral part of 
multidisciplinary management of cancer. Aforementioned factors have created 
blind spot zone of management purview of cervical cancer. Hence, we attempt to 
develop protocol for management of adverse events of cervical cancer. Symptoms' 
and medical conditions' management guidelines evolved on the basis of empirical 
clinical practice in community and premier oncology centers in 
resource-constrained developing countries has been presented in this short 
report. This report should not be an end in itself but has to attract attention 
of policy-makers, academicians, researchers, and practitioners toward advancing 
supportive care needs of cancer patients in low- and middle-income countries 
(LMIC).

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a primary cause of nosocomial infections. A key 
element in PA pathogenicity is its ability to form biofilms that withstand 
eradication by antibiotics and the immune system. Biofilm formation is 
controlled by phosphate signaling and here we provide evidence that PstS, a 
subunit of the PA Pst phosphate transporter, has a surprising role in this 
process. Using X-ray crystallography, we characterized the unique underpinnings 
of PstS phosphate binding and identified an unusual 15-residue N' loop 
extension. Structure-based experiments showed that PstS-mediated phosphate 
uptake and biofilm formation are in fact two distinct functions. Specifically, a 
point mutation that abrogated phosphate binding did not eliminate biofilm 
formation; conversely, truncation of the N' loop diminished the ability of PA to 
form biofilms but had no effect on phosphate binding and uptake. This places 
PstS at a junction that separately controls phosphate sensing and uptake and the 
ultrastructure organization of bacteria.

    Cancer. 2015 Jan 15;121(2):166-8.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer affects relatively young adults, and its overall 
survival is excellent. With long life expectancy, the development of subsequent 
cancers is an important concern for survivors of thyroid cancer. The objective 
of this study was to investigate the incidence and types of second primary 
malignancies in Korean patients with thyroid cancer.
METHODS: The study cohort included 178,844 registrants with thyroid cancer from 
the Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) database between 1993 and 2010. 
Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated using a statistical 
software program (SEER*Stat 8.0.4).
RESULTS: Among 178,844 patients with thyroid cancer, 2895 (1.6%) were diagnosed 
with subsequent second primary malignancies. The overall risks of a second 
primary cancer were elevated by 6% in patients who had thyroid cancer compared 
with the general population during the same period. The elevated risks for 
developing second cancers were observed in all sites except the stomach and 
cervix. The elevated risk of second primary cancers was observed within the 
first 10 years of follow-up. Leukemia and cancers of the salivary gland, kidney, 
prostate, lung, and breast had the most significantly elevated risks as 
secondary cancers and presented as early as during the first 5 years after the 
initial diagnosis of thyroid cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest, standardized, population-based study to date 
using nationwide data from the entire Korean population. The risks of several 
cancers were elevated significantly during follow-up, thus alerting physicians 
to pay special attention in their care of patients with thyroid cancer and 
long-term survivors.

Transcription of protein-coding genes is highly dependent on the RNA polymerase 
II core promoter. Core promoters, generally defined as the regions that direct 
transcription initiation, consist of functional core promoter motifs (such as 
the TATA-box, initiator [Inr], and downstream core promoter element [DPE]) that 
confer specific properties to the core promoter. The known basal transcription 
factors that support TATA-dependent transcription are insufficient for in vitro 
transcription of DPE-dependent promoters. In search of a transcription factor 
that supports DPE-dependent transcription, we used a biochemical complementation 
approach and identified the Drosophila TBP (TATA-box-binding protein)-related 
factor 2 (TRF2) as an enriched factor in the fractions that support 
DPE-dependent transcription. We demonstrate that the short TRF2 isoform 
preferentially activates DPE-dependent promoters. DNA microarray analysis 
reveals the enrichment of DPE promoters among short TRF2 up-regulated genes. 
Using primer extension analysis and reporter assays, we show the importance of 
the DPE in transcriptional regulation of TRF2 target genes. It was previously 
shown that, unlike TBP, TRF2 fails to bind DNA containing TATA-boxes. Using 
microfluidic affinity analysis, we discovered that short TRF2-bound DNA oligos 
are enriched for Inr and DPE motifs. Taken together, our findings highlight the 
role of short TRF2 as a preferential core promoter regulator.

Pressure drop associated with coarctation of the aorta (CoA) can be successfully 
treated surgically or by stent placement. However, a decreased life expectancy 
associated with altered aortic hemodynamics was found in long-term studies. 
Image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is intended to support particular 
diagnoses, to help in choosing between treatment options, and to improve 
performance of treatment procedures. This study aimed to prove the ability of 
CFD to improve aortic hemodynamics in CoA patients. In 13 patients (6 males, 7 
females; mean age 25 ± 14 years), we compared pre- and post-treatment peak 
systole hemodynamics [pressure drops and wall shear stress (WSS)] vs. virtual 
treatment as proposed by biomedical engineers. Anatomy and flow data for CFD 
were based on MRI and angiography. Segmentation, geometry reconstruction and 
virtual treatment geometry were performed using the software ZIBAmira, whereas 
peak systole flow conditions were simulated with the software ANSYS(®) 
Fluent(®). Virtual treatment significantly reduced pressure drop compared to 
post-treatment values by a mean of 2.8 ± 3.15 mmHg, which significantly reduced 
mean WSS by 3.8 Pa. Thus, CFD has the potential to improve post-treatment 
hemodynamics associated with poor long-term prognosis of patients with 
coarctation of the aorta. MRI-based CFD has a huge potential to allow the slight 
reduction of post-treatment pressure drop, which causes significant improvement 
(reduction) of the WSS at the stenosis segment.
