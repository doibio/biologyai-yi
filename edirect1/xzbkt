preference-based measure. The EORTC-8D, a cancer-specific preference-based 
measure, has 81,920 health states and is useful for economic evaluations in 
cancer care. The aim of this study was to develop a utility algorithm to value 
EORTC-8D health states using preferences derived from a representative 
population sample in Sri Lanka.
METHODS: The time-tradeoff method was used to elicit preferences from a general 
population sample of 780 in Sri Lanka. A block design of 85 health states, with 
a time horizon of 10 years, was used for the direct valuation. Data were 
analyzed using generalized least squares with random effects. All respondents 
with at least one logical inconsistency were excluded from the analysis.
RESULTS: After logical inconsistencies were excluded, 4520 observations were 
available from 717 respondents for the analysis. The preferred model specified 
main effects with an interaction term for any level 4 or worse descriptor within 
a health state. Worsening of physical functioning had a substantially greater 
utility decrement than any other dimension in this population. Limitations are 
that the data collection could not include the whole country and that females 
formed a large part of the sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Preference weights for EORTC-8D health states for Sri Lanka have 
been derived: These will be very useful in economic evaluations of 
cancer-related interventions in a range of low- and middle-income countries.

BACKGROUND: The individual risk of recurrence in hormone receptor-positive 
primary breast cancer patients determines whether adjuvant endocrine therapy 
should be combined with chemotherapy. Clinicopathological parameters and 
molecular tests such as EndoPredict(®) (EPclin) can support decision making in 
patients with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2 (HER2)-negative cancer.
OBJECTIVE: Using a life-long Markov state transition model, we determined the 
health economic impact and incremental cost effectiveness of EPclin-based risk 
stratification in combination with clinical guidelines [German-S3, National 
Comprehensive Cancer Center Network (NCCN), and St. Gallen] to decide on 
chemotherapy use.
METHODS: Information on overall and metastasis-free survival came from Austrian 
Breast & Colorectal Cancer Study Group clinical trials 6/8 (n = 1,619) and 
published literature. Effectiveness was assessed as quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). Costs (2010) were assessed from a German third-party payer perspective.
RESULTS: Lifetime costs per patient ranged from <euro>28,268 (St.Gallen and 
EPclin) to <euro>33,756 (NCCN). Due to an imperfect prognostic value and 
differences in chemotherapy use, strategies achieved between 13.165 QALYs (NCCN) 
and 13.173 QALYs (EPclin alone) per patient. Using German-S3 as reference, three 
strategies showed dominant results (St. Gallen and EPclin, German-S3 and EPclin, 
EPclin alone). Compared to German-S3, the addition of EPclin saved <euro>3,388 
and gained 0.002 QALYs per patient. Combining guidelines with EPclin remained 
preferable in sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that molecular markers can be sensibly combined 
with clinical guidelines to determine the risk profile of adjuvant breast cancer 
patients. Compared with the current German best practice (German-S3), 
combinations of EPclin with the St. Gallen, German-S3 or NCCN guideline and 
EPclin alone were dominant from the perspective of the German healthcare system.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of the 
novel fixed-dose anticoagulant rivaroxaban compared with the current standard of 
care, warfarin, for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial 
fibrillation (AF).
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to model the costs and health outcomes 
of both treatments, potential adverse events, and resulting health states over 
35 years. Analyses were based on a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old patients 
with non-valvular AF at moderate to high risk of stroke. The main outcome 
measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over the lifetime, 
and was assessed from the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) perspective. 
Costs and utility data were drawn from public data and the literature, while 
event probabilities were derived from both the literature and rivaroxaban's 
pivotal ROCKET AF trial.
RESULTS: Stroke prophylaxis with rivaroxaban offers health improvements over 
warfarin treatment at additional cost. From the SHI perspective, at baseline the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of rivaroxaban was <euro>15,207 per QALY 
gained in 2014. The results were robust to changes in the majority of variables; 
however, they were sensitive to the price of rivaroxaban, the hazard ratios for 
stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, the time horizon, and the discount rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the substantially higher medication costs 
of rivaroxaban were offset by mitigating the shortcomings of warfarin, most 
notably frequent dose regulation and bleeding risk. Future health economic 
studies on novel oral anticoagulants should evaluate the cost effectiveness for 
secondary stroke prevention and, as clinical data from direct head-to-head 
comparisons become available, new anticoagulation therapies should be compared 
against each other.

OBJECTIVE: We estimated the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) burden of 
abusive head trauma (AHT) at ages 0 to 4 years in the United States.
METHODS: DALYs are computed by summing years of productive life that survivors 
lost to disability plus life-years lost to premature death. Surveying a 
convenience sample of 170 caregivers and pediatricians yielded health-related 
disability over time according to severity of AHT (measured with the Health 
Utilities Index, Mark 2). Incidence estimates for 2009 came from Vital 
Statistics for Mortality, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Program Kids' 
Inpatient Database for hospitalized survivors, and published ratios of 0.894 
case treated and released and 0.340 case not diagnosed/treated while in the 
acute phase per survivor admitted. Survival probability over time after 
discharge came from published sources.
RESULTS: An estimated 4824 AHT cases in 2009 included 334 fatalities within 30 
days. DALYs per surviving child averaged 0.555 annually for severe AHT (95% 
confidence interval: 0.512-0.598) and 0.155 (95% confidence interval: 
0.120-0.190) for other cases. Including life-years lost to premature mortality, 
estimated lifetime burden averaged 4.7 DALYs for mild AHT, 5.4 for moderate AHT, 
24.1 for severe AHT, and 29.8 for deaths. On average, DALY loss per 30-day 
survivor included 7.6 years of lost life expectancy and 5.7 years lived with 
disability. Estimated burden of AHT incidents in 2009 was 69 925 DALYs or 0.017 
DALYs per US live birth.
CONCLUSIONS: AHT is extremely serious, often resulting in severe physical damage 
or death. The annual DALY burden several years after mild AHT exceeds the DALY 
burden of a severe burn.

PURPOSE: The proposed Men's Health Index (MHI) aims to provide a practical and 
systematic framework for comprehensively assessing and stratifying older men 
with the intention of optimising their health and functional status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed from 1980 
to 2012. We specifically looked for instruments which: assess men's health, 
frailty and fitness; predict life expectancy, mortality and morbidities. The 
instruments were assessed by the researchers who then agreed on the tools to be 
included in the MHI. When there was disagreements, the researchers discussed and 
reached a consensus guided by the principle that the MHI could be used in the 
primary care setting targetting men aged 55-65 years.
RESULTS: The instruments chosen include the Charlson's Combined Comorbidity-Age 
Index; the International Index of Erectile Function-5; the International 
Prostate Symptom Score; the Androgen Deficiency in Aging Male; the Survey of 
Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe Frailty Instrument; the Sitting-Rising 
Test; the Senior Fitness Test; the Fitness Assessment Score; and the Depression 
Anxiety Stress Scale-21. A pilot test on eight men was carried out and showed 
that the men's health index is viable.
CONCLUSIONS: The concept of assessing, stratifying, and optimizing men's health 
should be incorporated into routine health care, and this can be implemented by 
using the MHI. This index is particularly useful to primary care physicians who 
are in a strategic position to engage men at the peri-retirement age in a 
conversation about their life goals based on their current and predicted health 
status.

BACKGROUND: There is substantial lack of knowledge about the role of 
socioeconomic status (SES) indicators on life expectancy (LE) within-cities, 
especially within mega-cities. We aimed to investigate the disparities of LE 
within city districts of Tehran, Iran, and specify how SES inequalities play 
role on LE.
METHODS: The death and population data for 2010 by different age, gender, and 
residency district were obtained from the main cemetery of Tehran and 
statistical centre of Iran, respectively. Age-specific mortality rates and 
consequently LE were calculated for all 22 districts by different genders. 
Finally, based on the results of first Tehran's Urban Health Equity Assessment 
and Response Tool (Urban HEART) project in 2008, the influence of social classes 
(SCs), total costs, and education indicators were analyzed on LE at birth (e0).
RESULTS: The e0 for total males and females in Tehran were calculated as 74.6 
and 78.4 years for 2010, respectively. The maximum LE of 80 years was observed 
in females of northern part with higher SES, and the minimum e0 of 72.7 years 
observed in males of southern part with lower SES. The e0 gender gap among 
districts was 5.5 years for females and 3.7 years for males. The highest and 
lowest mean of e0 observed in SC1 (highest class) and SC5 (lowest class), were 
77.6 and 76.0 years, respectively. The lowest mean of e0 observed in the first 
group of total costs indicator and was 76.2 years. In addition, the lowest 
observed mean of e0 was in the first category of education indicator 
(illiterate) and was 76.0 years.
CONCLUSION: RESULTS indicate substantial disparities in LE within city 
districts. This confirms that SES disparities within-cities would have direct 
influences on LE.

Heart failure and galectin 3.

Suarez G(1), Meyerrose G(1).

Author information:
(1)1 Department of Internal Medicine, 2 Department of Cardiology, Texas Tech 
University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX, USA.

Innovations in medical diagnosis and treatment have led to prolongation of life 
of patients. Increasing the life expectancy of cardiac patients and thereby 
increasing the prevalence of heart failure (HF). Currently more than one million 
hospital admissions per year are due to HF and it has been estimated that the 
cost is approximately $39 billion annually in the U.S. There are two 
pathophysiologic myocardial mechanisms that cause HF: systolic dysfunction and 
diastolic dysfunction. Normal cardiac aging is characterized by morphological 
and structural changes that increase cardiomyocyte size, increased number of 
apoptosis with decreased number in myocytes, increased collagen deposition, and 
functional changes at cellular level. All these factors contribute to fibrotic 
remodeling that leads to LV diastolic stiffness, which ultimately leads to 
impaired diastolic function. At the same time it has been shown that galectin-3, 
a soluble β-galactoside-binding protein secreted by activated macrophages, 
promotes cardiac fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and ventricular 
dysfunction. In this paper we review the prognostic value of galectin-3 as an 
independent predictor of mortality in patients with moderate to advanced chronic 
HF (CHF).

The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of second-eye cataract 
surgery: a systematic review and economic evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Elective cataract surgery is the most commonly performed surgical 
procedure in the NHS. In bilateral cataracts, the eye with greatest vision 
impairment from cataract is operated on first. First-eye surgery can improve 
vision and quality of life. However, it is unclear whether or not cataract 
surgery on the second eye provides enough incremental benefit to be considered 
clinically effective and cost-effective.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and analysis 
of cost-effectiveness of second-eye cataract surgery in England and Wales, based 
on an economic model informed by systematic reviews of cost-effectiveness and 
quality of life.
DATA SOURCES: Twelve electronic bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and the Centre for Reviews and 
Dissemination databases were searched from database inception to April 2013, 
with searches updated in July 2013. Reference lists of relevant publications 
were also checked and experts consulted.
REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened references, extracted and 
checked data from the included studies and appraised their risk of bias. Based 
on the review of cost-effectiveness, a de novo economic model was developed to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of second-eye surgery in bilateral cataract 
patients. The model is based on changes in quality of life following second-eye 
surgery and includes post-surgical complications.
RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of clinical effectiveness, 
three studies of cost-effectiveness and 10 studies of health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) met the inclusion criteria for the systematic reviews and, where 
possible, were used to inform the economic analysis. Heterogeneity of studies 
precluded meta-analyses, and instead data were synthesised narratively. The RCTs 
assessed visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, stereopsis and several measures of 
HRQoL. Improvements in binocular visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were 
small and unlikely to be of clinical significance, but stereopsis was improved 
to a clinically meaningful extent following second-eye surgery. Studies did not 
provide evidence that second-eye surgery significantly affected HRQoL, apart 
from an improvement in the mental health component of HRQoL in one RCT. In the 
model, second-eye surgery generated 0.68 incremental quality-adjusted life-years 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £1964. Model results were most 
sensitive to changes in the utility gain associated with second-eye surgery, but 
otherwise robust to changes in parameter values. The probability that second-eye 
surgery is cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of £10,000 and 
£20,000 is 100%.
LIMITATIONS: Clinical effectiveness studies were all conducted more than 9 years 
ago. Patients had good vision pre surgery which may not represent all patients 
eligible for second-eye surgery. For some vision-related patient-reported 
outcomes and HRQoL measures, thresholds for determining important clinical 
effects are either unclear or have not been determined.
CONCLUSIONS: Second-eye cataract surgery is generally cost-effective based on 
the best available data and under most assumptions. However, more up-to-date 
data are needed. A well-conducted RCT that reflects current populations and 
enables the estimation of health state utility values would be appropriate. 
Guidance is required on which vision-related, patient-reported outcomes are 
suitable for assessing effects of cataract surgery in the NHS and how these 
measures should be interpreted clinically.

Cost-effectiveness of gemcitabine versus PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin for 
recurrent or progressive ovarian cancer: comparing chemotherapy with 
nanotherapy.

BE3500 Hasselt, Belgium.

This article examines the cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy (gemcitabine) 
versus nanotherapy (PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin) in the treatment of ovarian 
cancer. Significant differences in costs were mainly due to the initial drug 
costs, which were €1285.28 in favor of chemotherapy. These costs were more than 
offset by hospitalization costs, which were €2670.21 in favor of the 
nanotherapy. The cost per quality-adjusted life week (QALW) for the nanotherapy 
was estimated to be €220.92/QALW for the base case and ranged from €170-318/QALW 
based on model assumptions. The clinical benefit associated with nanotherapy was 
achieved, yielding not only positive cost-effectiveness results, but also, 
surprisingly, financial savings. Although more studies are necessary, this first 
comprehensive analysis supports the further use of nanotherapy for ovarian 
cancer.

Proteins endocytosed from serum are degraded in the lysosomes. However, serum 
albumin (SA) and IgG, through its Fc part, bind to the neonatal Fc receptor 
(FcRn) at low pH in the endosome after endocytosis, and are transported back to 
the cellular surface, where they are released into the bloodstream, resulting in 
an extended serum circulation time. Association with Fc or SA has been used to 
prolong the in vivo half-life of biopharmaceuticals, using the interaction with 
FcRn to improve treatment regimens. This has been achieved either directly, by 
fusion or conjugation to Fc or SA, or indirectly, using SA-binding proteins. The 
present work takes this principle one step further, presenting small affinity 
proteins that bind directly to FcRn, mediating extension of the serum half-life 
of fused biomolecules. Phage display technology was used to select affibody 
molecules that can bind to FcRn in the pH-dependent manner required for rescue 
by FcRn. The biophysical and binding properties were characterized in vitro, and 
the affibody molecules were found to bind to FcRn more strongly at low pH than 
at neutral pH. Attachment of the affibody molecules to a recombinant protein, 
already engineered for increased half-life, resulted in a nearly threefold 
longer half-life in mice. These tags should have general use as fusion partners 
to biopharmaceuticals to extend their half-lives in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness 
of zinc supplementation for the treatment of acute diarrhea (AD) in children 
younger than 5 years in Colombia.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the perspective of 
the Colombian health system. The standard treatment with the addition of zinc 
was compared with the standard treatment without zinc in children younger than 5 
years. The time horizon was 1 month. Effectiveness was extracted from a 
systematic review of literature. The specific data for Colombia were taken from 
local databases and observational studies. To determine the costs, a typical 
case was constructed by reviewing guidelines and medical records and validated 
by experts. To evaluate the resources consumed, Colombian tariff manuals were 
used. Costs were stated in Colombian pesos (COP) and US dollar (USD) for 2010. 
Deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of 
changes in cost and effectiveness of the strategies on the results from the 
model.
RESULTS: The results from the model indicate that zinc supplementation is a 
dominant strategy; it is less costly and more effective than standard treatment 
without zinc (reduction of $15,210 COP [8.14 USD] per child). The results are 
sensitive to changes in the probability of hospitalization and of persistent 
diarrhea.
CONCLUSIONS: Zinc for the treatment of AD is a highly cost-effective strategy 
and is recommended for inclusion in the benefit plan of the Colombian health 
system. This intervention is more cost-effective in children with a higher risk 
of persistent diarrhea and hospitalization.

BACKGROUND: The Spectrum program is used to estimate key HIV indicators for 
national programmes. The purpose of the study is to describe the key updates 
made to Spectrum in the last 2 years to produce the version used in the 2013 
global estimates of HIV/AIDS.
METHODS: The United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Reference Group on 
Estimates, Models and Projections regularly reviews new data and information 
needs and recommends updates to the methodology and assumptions used in 
Spectrum. The latest data from surveys, census and special studies are used to 
estimate key parameter values for countries and regions.
RESULTS: Country-specific life tables prepared by the United National Population 
Division (UNPD) have been incorporated into Spectrum's demographic projections 
replacing the model life tables used previously. This update includes revised 
estimates of non-AIDS life expectancy. Incidence among all adults 15-49 years 
generated from curve fitting to surveillance and survey data is now split by age 
using incidence rate ratios derived from Analysing Longitudinal Population-based 
HIV/AIDS data on Africa Network data for generalized epidemics. Methods for 
estimating the number of AIDS orphans have been updated to include the changing 
effects of PMTCT and antiretroviral therapy programmes. Procedures for 
estimating the number of adults eligible for treatment have been updated to 
reflect the 2013 WHO guidelines. Program data on AIDS mortality has been used to 
estimate prevalence trends in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico for the 2013 
estimates.
CONCLUSION: Spectrum was updated for the 2013 round of HIV estimates in order to 
support national programmes with improved methods and data to estimating 
national indicators.

AIMS: There is limited evidence with respect to the cost-effectiveness of 
starting insulin in people with diabetes outside the 'western' world. The aim of 
this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of starting basal insulin 
treatment with insulin detemir in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately 
controlled on oral glucose-lowering drugs (OGLDs) in Mexico, South Korea, India, 
Indonesia, and Algeria.
METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical and cost 
outcomes over a 30-year time horizon. Clinical outcomes, baseline 
characteristics and health state utility data were taken from the A1chieve 
study. A 1-year analysis was also conducted based on treatment costs and 
quality-of-life data. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
expressed as a fraction of GDP per capita, and WHO-CHOICE recommendations 
(ICER < 3.0) used to define cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Starting insulin detemir was associated with a projected increase in 
life expectancy (≥1 year) and was considered cost-effective in all of the 
studied populations with ICERs of -0.02 (Mexico), 0.00 (South Korea), 0.48 
(India), 0.12 (Indonesia), and 0.88 (Algeria) GDP/quality-adjusted life-year. 
Cost-effectiveness was maintained after conducting sensitivity analyses in the 
30-year and 1-year analyses. A projected increase in treatment costs was 
partially offset by a reduction in complications. The difference in overall 
costs between insulin detemir and OGLDs alone was USD518, 1431, 3510, 15, and 
5219, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Changes in clinical outcomes associated with starting insulin 
detemir in insulin-naïve individuals with T2D resulted in health gains that made 
the intervention cost-effective in five countries with distinct healthcare 
resources.

OBJECTIVE: We report three new cases of müllerianosis of the urinary bladder.
METHODS: We present three cases of women in the third decade of life, two of 
them presenting hematuria and pelvic pain, and the third was referred to perform 
a recto-vaginal endometriosis surgical procedure. Diagnosis was made by 
ultrasound and cystoscopy in the first and second case, and by CT scan in the 
endometriosis case.
RESULTS: Müllerianosis of the urinary bladder is described as the presence of 
müllerian remnants (endometrial, endosalpinx and endocervix) in the bladder 
wall. Diagnosis is made as a result of a pathologic study of the resected 
lesions. Although a relapse of the disease is infrequent, it can happen, and 
close monitoring of the patients must be performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Müllerianosis of the bladder is a rare condition and differential 
diagnosis must be done with benign and malignant bladder lesions because it can 
affect the muscularis propia. It mostly presents as lower urinary tract symptoms 
and hematuria that can be cyclic. Transurethral resection is the treatment of 
choice in superficial and focal lesions. In the case of infiltration of the 
bladder muscle, and depending on the extension of the disease, partial 
cystectomy may be necessary.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the distribution, timing, and 
risk factors for psychopathology and to further examine the quality of life 
(QoL) in an Italian sample of children with recent onset epilepsy. 
Sociodemographic and psychosocial variables, family factors, as well as 
illness-related factors themselves were examined in order to clarify the 
relationship among these variables, psychopathology and QoL.
METHODS: For this purpose, 49 children and adolescents (4-18 years), 
consecutively referred to a Neurophysiology Service, were evaluated by a 
multidisciplinary team using dimensional as well as categorical instruments both 
self-administered (self-report and proxy-report) and interviewer administered.
RESULTS: Forty-five percent of the patients exhibited one or more Axis I 
disorders (DSM-IV) when evaluated with K-SADS-PL interview. It's worth noting 
that preadolescent and adolescent patients tend to underestimate their problems 
compared to their parents'opinion, when answering self-administer 
questionnaires. Self-reported QoL appeared to be generally satisfactory. Social 
and family factor, as well as epilepsy related factors appeared to be linked 
both to the presence of psychopathology and to the QoL. Patients affected by 
psychiatric disorders exhibited the poorest QoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Also after many years from the onset, childhood epilepsy frequently 
fosters negative consequences in terms of social life, work, psychopathology and 
life expectancy. The ability of health services and public health measures to 
prevent and treat psychiatric comorbidity may have a pivotal role in enhancing 
patients' QoL.

BACKGROUND: Prolyl oligopeptidases (POPs) are proteolytic enzymes, widely 
distributed in all the kingdoms of life. Bacterial POPs are pharmaceutically 
important enzymes, yet their functional and evolutionary details are not fully 
explored. Therefore, current analysis is aimed at understanding the 
distribution, domain architecture, probable biological functions and gene family 
expansion of POPs in bacterial and archaeal lineages.
RESULTS: Exhaustive sequence analysis of 1,202 bacterial and 91 archaeal genomes 
revealed ~3,000 POP homologs, with only 638 annotated POPs. We observed wide 
distribution of POPs in all the analysed bacterial lineages. Phylogenetic 
analysis and co-clustering of POPs of different phyla suggested their common 
functions in all the prokaryotic species. Further, on the basis of unique 
sequence motifs we could classify bacterial POPs into eight subtypes. Analysis 
of coexisting domains in POPs highlighted their involvement in protein-protein 
interactions and cellular signaling. We proposed significant extension of this 
gene family by characterizing 39 new POPs and 158 new α/β hydrolase members.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reflects diversity and functional importance of POPs in 
bacterial species. Many genomes with multiple POPs were identified with high 
sequence variations and different cellular localizations. Such anomalous 
distribution of POP genes in different bacterial genomes shows differential 
expansion of POP gene family primarily by multiple horizontal gene transfer 
events.

[An economic perspective on targeted treatments].

In the current context of crisis in the field of drug research and patients' 
increasing demand for greater involvement in the decision-making about their 
treatment, the possibility of a more personal tailored approach to medicine is 
emerging. This raises questions about the clinical benefits of targeted 
therapeutic approaches versus the cost of determining which patients are likely 
to benefit the most, and protecting the others from the toxicity of 
inappropriate treatments. Although cost-effectiveness studies shed light on this 
issue, the conclusions to which they point tend to be obscured by 
interdependence between the pricing of these tests and the cost of the 
treatments involved. Investigating the societal willingness-to-pay for gains in 
QALY (quality adjusted life year) should help to disentangle this 
interdependence and clarify the conclusions of cost-effectiveness studies.

BACKGROUND: We conducted a wait-list control randomised trial of an outpatient 
rehabilitation service for people living with and beyond cancer, delivered in a 
hospice day care unit. We report the results of an economic evaluation 
undertaken using the trial data.
METHODS: Forty-one participants were recruited into the study. A within-trial 
stochastic cost-utility analysis was undertaken using Monte-Carlo simulation. 
The outcome measure for the economic evaluation was quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs). Costs were measured from the perspective of the NHS and personal social 
services. Uncertainty in the observed data was captured through probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis. Scenario analysis was conducted to explore the effects of 
changing the way QALYs were estimated and adjusting for baseline difference in 
the population. We also explore assumptions about the length of treatment 
benefit being maintained.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the base-case 
analysis was £14,231 per QALY. When QALYs were assumed to change linearly over 
time, this increased to £20,514 per QALY at three months. Adjusting the estimate 
of QALYs to account for differences in the population at baseline increased the 
ICER to £94,748 per QALY at three months. Increasing the assumed length of 
treatment benefit led to reduced ICERs in all scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the intervention is likely to be cost-effective in some 
circumstances, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the decision to 
implement the service. Further research, informed by a formal value of 
information analysis, would reduce this uncertainty.

AIM: An Australian study of older, community-dwelling women found that 80% would 
rather be dead than experience loss of independence and nursing home admission 
after a bad hip fracture. We re-examined this issue using a conjoint analysis 
approach.
METHODS: We asked older hospital patients with a history of falls, fracture or 
osteoporosis to imagine they had a hip fracture resulting in significant 
residual disability. Subjects were asked to rank in order of preference an 
orthogonal array of nine out of 36 potential outcome scenarios reporting risk of 
falls, life expectancy, discharge home with support or to a nursing home and 
family agreement or disagreement with discharge location.
RESULTS: Of 192 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 183 agreed to 
participate and 97 completed the study. Those who failed to complete the study 
were older and had lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores than those who 
completed the study. For the group as a whole, averaged importance scores were: 
discharge residence 31.3%, length of life 27%, fall risk 26.4% and family 
preference 15.5%. On average, subjects would be willing to sacrifice 
approximately 9 months of life in order to return home rather than go to a 
nursing home.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, older people at high risk for fracture judged 
that after a bad hip fracture their main priority would be to remain at home.

Heart disease is the number one killer in the USA, making cardiogenesis and its 
related pathways a relevant area of study for improving health and life 
expectancy. The Mexican salamander (axolotl), Ambystoma mexicanum, provides an 
excellent vertebrate animal model for studying myofibrillogenesis due to its 
naturally occurring cardiac nonfunction mutation. Homozygous recessive embryos 
do not develop normal hearts due to a lack of myofibril formation. In previous 
studies, myofibril-inducing ribonucleic acid (MIR) from the normal wild-type 
axolotl genome was found to rescue mutant nonfunctioning hearts through 
restoration of tropomyosin levels followed by normal myofibril formation. Our 
purpose in this study is to identify and characterize functional homologs for 
the MIR from human fetal heart ribonucleic acid (RNA). After randomized cloning 
of human fetal heart RNA, 396 clones were analyzed for rescuing ability by using 
mutant heart rescue bioassays and confocal microscopy. By these analyses, we 
discovered a functional homolog of MIR from human fetal heart RNA, which is 
associated with the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene. This RNA 
came from our clone #30 and induces tropomyosin synthesis and myofibrillogenesis 
in mutant axolotl hearts which ordinarily do not synthesize tropomyosin or form 
organized myofibrils. Clone #30, a mitochondrial RNA molecule associated with 
human cytochrome c oxidase, serves as a functional homolog of MIR, leading to 
tropomyosin production, organized myofibrils, and beating cardiac tissue in 
mutant hearts. These findings hold great potential for the treatment and repair 
of damaged hearts in patients who have suffered from myocardial infarctions and 
other heart diseases.

Adjusting relative survival estimates for cancer mortality in the general 
population.

Ellison LF(1).

Author information:
(1)Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0T6.

BACKGROUND: In theory, expected survival probabilities used in the derivation of 
relative survival ratios (RSR) are determined from a control group free of the 
cancer under study. In practice, expected survival is typically estimated from 
general population life tables--which include people previously diagnosed with 
cancer--potentially leading to an overestimation of relative survival.
DATA AND METHODS: Data are from the Canadian Cancer Registry with mortality 
follow-up through record linkage to the Canadian Vital Statistics Death 
Database. Period method RSRs for 2006-to-2008 were derived using general 
population life tables adjusted for cancer mortality and then compared with 
estimates derived using corresponding unadjusted life tables.
RESULTS: For all cancers combined, the use of general population life tables to 
derive expected survival probabilities overestimated RSRs by 0.6 (1-year), 2.4 
(5-year) and 4.6 (10-year) percentage units. Biases in 5-year survival were 
highest among males (3.0) and among people aged 75 to 99 at diagnosis (4.1). The 
bias was negligible for most individual cancers; biases were highest for 
prostate cancer, followed by colorectal and female breast cancer.
INTERPRETATION: Canadian estimates of relative survival for all cancers combined 
calculated using general life tables warrant adjustment for cancer mortality. 
Consideration of adjustment for cancer mortality is recommended for estimates of 
colorectal, female breast and especially prostate cancer.

Electrical injuries. Biological values measurements as a prediction factor of 
local evolution in electrocutions lesions.

Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.

RATIONALE: Taking into account the incidence and the severity of electrocutions, 
we consider it extremely necessary to find effective, appropriate and 
particularized therapeutic solutions aimed at improving the survival, decreasing 
the mortality, ensuring a superior functional and aesthetic effect and 
facilitating the social reintegration. Given the severity of the general 
condition of the electrically injured patient and the fact that any worsening of 
the lesions has a systemic echo, the selection of the timing for re-excision is 
very important. The postponement of the surgical timing can break the precarious 
metabolic equilibrium and can hasten the installation of the multisystem organ 
failure (MSOF).
OBJECTIVE: The study is intended to establish a possible connection between the 
clinical evolution of the electrically injured patient and the dynamics of three 
important biological parameters, able to provide data concerning the therapeutic 
attitude to be followed. The patients with a diagnostic of high-voltage 
electrocution, who will be admitted to the Clinic, will be followed for a period 
of 2 years. The parameters to be followed daily will be: - Creatin-kinase, as a 
marker of muscular damage. - Hemoglobin, as a marker of tissue oxygenation. - 
Leukocytes, as an indicator of a possible septic evolution. The therapeutic 
alternatives, including the administration of antiplatelet drugs will be 
studied.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In the period October 2010-June 2013 a total of 12 cases of 
high-voltage electrocution were admitted in our clinic. Among these, some could 
be placed in the study of 7 cases, as the remaining patients died within the 
first 24 hours of hospitalization due to the endured lesions. All the patients 
were admitted to the ICU ward that supported the treatment and monitoring until 
their stabilization, at which time they were transferred to the ward. All the 
patients received anti-thromboxane treatment from their admission (injectable 
NSAIDs associated with antisecretory drugs). By mutual agreement with ICU 
service, Dipyridamole was not introduced because of the "steal effect" in the 
viable areas to the detriment of the already ischemic areas, the drug effect 
being obvious in vitro, but hard to be proven in the clinical case. The 
relationship between the CK level and the clinical appearance of the ischemic 
areas is relative. We cannot conclude that an increased level of CK is 
equivalent to an enlarged ischemic area and even less it does not provide us 
direct information concerning the best time for re-excision. The presence of a 
viable blood supply around the necrotic tissue will lead to an important 
resorption of degradation products in that area, a quasinormal level of CK 
having no value. The sealing of the necrosis areas and the lack of immediate 
resorption does not have a positive prognostic value. Taking into account that 
the electrocutions are mostly multiple injuries, the CK level can increase even 
after some muscular damages, fractures, independent of the actual electrocution 
lesion. In one case, the patient suffered from electrocution at both thoracic 
limbs. With the carbonization of the hands and grifa installed up to the level 
of the elbow fold, he stayed for 6 hours at the accident site until he had been 
recovered. At the moment of presentation to the hospital, his consciousness 
condition was satisfactory but the CK level was of over 20000 IU, becoming 
rapidly non-detectable, in combination with black urine. The patient's condition 
deteriorated quickly, and, although the bilateral shoulder disarticulation has 
been carried out, he died in the next 12 hours.
DISCUSSION: As a conclusion, the CK level did not prove itself a prognostic for 
the surgical timing or the actual surgical attitude and could be influenced by a 
whole series of factors, dependent or not on the electrocution lesion. A radical 
attitude is to be preferred in cases with established ischemia; the prognostic 
being the more reserved the larger the damage and the longer the period of time 
from the event. The established treatment is of renal support and treatment of 
acute renal injury (AKI) subsequently installed. An increased level of
