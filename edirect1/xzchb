deviation) separated participants at high and low risk of developing POAG.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and patients can make evidence-based decisions about the 
management of ocular hypertension using the risk model and considering patient 
age, medical status, life expectancy, and personal preference.

The number of elderly people has increased considerably over the last decades, 
due to a rising life expectancy and ageing populations. As a result, an 
increased number of elderly with end-stage-renal-disease are diagnosed, for 
which the preferred treatment is renal transplantation. Over the past years the 
awareness of the elderly as a specific patient population has grown, which 
increases the importance of research in this group. Elderly patients often 
receive kidneys from elderly donors while younger donor kidneys are 
preferentially reserved for younger recipients. Although the rate of acute 
rejection after transplantation is lower in the elderly, these rejections may 
lead to graft loss more frequently, as kidneys from elderly donors have marginal 
reserve capacity. To prevent acute rejection, immunosuppressive therapy is 
needed. On the other hand, elderly patients have a higher risk to die from 
infectious complications, and thus less immunosuppression would be preferable. 
Immunosuppressive treatment in the elderly is complicated further by changes in 
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with increasing age. Adjustments in 
standard immunosuppressive regimes are therefore suggested for this population. 
An unmet need in transplantation medicine is a tool to guide a personalized 
approach to immunosuppression. Recently several promising biomarkers that 
identify injury to the graft at an early stage or predict acute rejection have 
been identified. Unfortunately, none of these biomarkers were tested 
specifically in the elderly. We believe there is an urgent need to perform 
clinical trials investigating novel immunosuppressive regimens in conjunction 
with biomarker studies in this specific population.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine the mortality within 20 years of diagnosis of 
chronic open-angle glaucoma (COAG) and visual acuity and visual field 
progression of a cohort followed for 20 years.
METHODS: Twenty years following the diagnosis of COAG in 68 of 436 (16%) 
patients seen in a glaucoma case-finding clinic, visual and mortality outcomes 
were audited from medical records. Causes of death were obtained from general 
practitioner records and death certificates. Probability of death was calculated 
using a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. The visual field of each eye of survivors 
was graded using a nine-stage severity scale. Visual outcome was analysed at the 
20-year follow-up visit.
RESULTS: From 68, 14 (21%) were lost to follow-up. In the remaining 54, 20 (37%) 
were alive 20 years after diagnosis. Of 63% who died, mean age of death was 84 
years, most commonly due to vascular disease. Mean age at presentation of those 
who died was 73.7 years versus 63.2 years for survivors (P=0.001). The median 
time to death was 16 years. On visual field analysis, nearly half (48.9%) of 
eyes did not deteriorate, but 28.3% eyes deteriorated by more than two stages. 
Those who died had worse final visual acuity than survivors (P<0.001). Three who 
died were registered severely visually impaired mainly from macular disease, but 
no survivors were registered (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: In this cohort, approximately two-thirds of patients with glaucoma 
died within 20 years of diagnosis. In most older patients with glaucoma, the 
overall goal of preventing visual handicap and blindness is achievable 20 years 
after diagnosis.

Cost-effectiveness of a complex workplace dietary intervention: an economic 
evaluation of the Food Choice at Work study.

House), University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness of complex 
workplace dietary interventions, involving nutrition education and system-level 
dietary modification, from the perspective of healthcare providers and 
employers.
DESIGN: Single-study economic evaluation of a cluster-controlled trial (Food 
Choice at Work (FCW) study) with 1-year follow-up.
SETTING: Four multinational manufacturing workplaces in Cork, Ireland.
PARTICIPANTS: 517 randomly selected employees (18-65 years) from four 
workplaces.
INTERVENTIONS: Cost data were obtained from the FCW study. Nutrition education 
included individual nutrition consultations, nutrition information (traffic 
light menu labelling, posters, leaflets and emails) and presentations. 
System-level dietary modification included menu modification (restriction of 
fat, sugar and salt), increase in fibre, fruit discounts, strategic positioning 
of healthier alternatives and portion size control. The combined intervention 
included nutrition education and system-level dietary modification. No 
intervention was implemented in the control.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was an improvement in health-related quality of 
life, measured using the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Levels questionnaire. The 
secondary outcome measure was reduction in absenteeism, which is measured in 
monetary amounts. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Monte Carlo simulation) 
assessed parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: The system-level intervention dominated the education and combined 
interventions. When compared with the control, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (€101.37/quality-adjusted life-year) is less than the 
nationally accepted ceiling ratio, so the system-level intervention can be 
considered cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicates 
there is some decision uncertainty surrounding this, arising from uncertainty 
surrounding the differences in effectiveness. These results are reiterated when 
the secondary outcome measure is considered in a cost-benefit analysis, whereby 
the system-level intervention yields the highest net benefit (€56.56 per 
employee).
CONCLUSIONS: System-level dietary modification alone offers the most value per 
improving employee health-related quality of life and generating net benefit for 
employers by reducing absenteeism. While system-level dietary modification 
strategies are potentially sustainable obesity prevention interventions, future 
research should include long-term outcomes to determine if improvements in 
outcomes persist.

Whose values should count - those of patients or the general public - when 
adopting the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) framework for healthcare decision 
making is a long-standing debate. Specific disciplines, such as economics, are 
not wedded to a particular side of the debate, and arguments for and against the 
use of patient values have been discussed at length in the literature. In 2012, 
Sinclair proposed an approach, grounded within patient preference theory, which 
sought to avoid a perceived unfair discrimination against people with 
disabilities when using values from the general public. Key assumptions about 
general public values that beget this line of thinking were that 'disabled 
states always tally with lower quality of life', and the use of standardised 
instruments means that 'you are forced into a fixed view of disability as a 
lower value state' (Sinclair, 2012). Drawing on recent contributions to the 
health economics literature, we contend that such assumptions are not inherent 
to the incorporation of general public values for the estimation of QALYs. In 
practice, whether health states of people with disabilities are of 'lower value' 
is, to some extent, a reflection of the health state descriptions that members 
of the public are asked to value.

Due to the recommendations in the urological guidelines to perform 
nephron-sparing surgery in patients with organ-confined renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC), the customary therapy regimen changed, but it is not well studied yet 
whether partial nephrectomy (PN) especially in the elderly is beneficial. From 
2000 to 2015, 3,592 patients from 7 clinics undergoing surgery in RCC were 
identified; 2,323 had T1 tumours. We retrospectively compared the overall 
survival benefit of patients with T1 RCC who underwent either PN or radical 
nephrectomy (RN) and studied effects of age and gender.
RESULTS: In T1 RCC, PN was beneficial in male patients (p = 0.0006) independent 
of age, especially in those men ≤75 years of age (p = 0.0005); but PN was not 
beneficial for female patients (p = 0.0629) regardless of age and male patients 
older than 75 years (p = 0.736). The OS of female patients after RN and male 
patients after PN is the same, regardless of age. A life expectancy of more than 
45 months at least is necessary to experience an overall survival benefit after 
PN.
CONCLUSIONS: There should be harder proven indications for PN in female patients 
and especially in all patients older than 75 years, particularly with regard to 
perioperative risk factors.

As part of its single technology appraisal process, the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence invited the manufacturer (Eli Lilly) of baricitinib 
(BARI; Olumiant®; a Janus kinase inhibitor that is taken orally) to submit 
evidence of its clinical and cost effectiveness for the treatment of moderate to 
severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after the failure of disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The School of Health and Related Research 
Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to 
act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a detailed 
review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the 
technology, based on the company's submission (CS) to NICE. The 
clinical-effectiveness evidence in the CS for BARI was based predominantly on 
three randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of BARI against 
adalimumab or placebo, as well as one long-term extension study. The 
clinical-effectiveness review identified no head-to-head evidence on the 
efficacy of BARI against all the comparators within the scope. Therefore, the 
company performed network meta-analyses (NMAs) in two different populations: one 
in patients who had experienced an inadequate response to conventional DMARDs 
(cDMARD-IR), and the other in patients who had experienced an inadequate 
response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi-IR). The company's NMAs 
concluded BARI had comparable efficacy as the majority of its comparators in 
both populations. The company submitted a de novo discrete event simulation 
model that analysed the incremental cost-effectiveness of BARI versus its 
comparators for the treatment of RA from the perspective of the National Health 
Service (NHS) in four different populations: (1) cDMARD-IR patients with 
moderate RA, defined as a 28-Joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) > 3.2 and no 
more than 5.1; (2) cDMARD-IR patients with severe RA (defined as a DAS28 > 5.1); 
(3) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom rituximab (RTX) was eligible; and 
(4) TNFi-IR patients with severe RA for whom RTX in combination with 
methotrexate (MTX) is contraindicated or not tolerated. In the cDMARD-IR 
population with moderate RA, the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) for BARI in combination with MTX compared with intensive cDMARDs 
was estimated to be £37,420 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In the 
cDMARD-IR population with severe RA, BARI in combination with MTX dominated all 
comparators except for certolizumab pegol (CTZ) in combination with MTX, with 
the ICER of CTZ in combination with MTX compared with BARI in combination with 
MTX estimated to be £18,400 per QALY gained. In the TNFi-IR population with 
severe RA, when RTX in combination with MTX was an option, BARI in combination 
with MTX was dominated by RTX in combination with MTX. In the TNFi-IR population 
with severe RA for whom RTX in combination with MTX is contraindicated or not 
tolerated, BARI in combination with MTX dominated golimumab in combination with 
MTX and was less effective and less expensive than the remaining comparators. 
Following a critique of the model, the ERG undertook exploratory analyses after 
applying corrections to the methods used in the NMAs and two programming errors 
in the economic model that affected the company's probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis (PSA) results. The ERG's NMA results were broadly comparable with the 
company's results. The programming error that affected the PSA of the severe 
cDMARD-IR population had only a minimal impact on the results, while the error 
affecting the severe TNFi-IR RTX-ineligible population resulted in markedly 
higher costs and QALYs gained for the affected comparators but did not 
substantially modify the conclusions of the analysis. The NICE Appraisal 
Committee concluded that BARI in combination with MTX or as monotherapy is a 
cost-effective use of NHS resources in patients with severe RA, except in 
TNFi-IR patients who are RTX-eligible.

Tocilizumab (TCZ) is the first humanized anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor 
monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), Castleman's disease, polyarticular and systemic juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, and, most recently, giant cell arteritis as well as for 
the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy-induced cytokine 
release syndrome. The global clinical development program for TCZ provides a 
wealth of clinical data on intravenous TCZ, and more recent studies in patients 
with RA have provided evidence characterizing the role of intravenous TCZ as 
monotherapy in early disease and led to the introduction of a subcutaneous 
formulation of TCZ. In addition, recently published open-label extension and 
observational studies continue to support the long-term efficacy and safety of 
TCZ in both clinical trial and real-world settings. Given the involvement of 
IL-6-mediated signaling in inflammatory disorders, TCZ is also being 
investigated in other immunological diseases. In particular, a phase 2 trial on 
the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous TCZ in adults with systemic sclerosis 
shows clinically relevant improvements in skin sclerosis and lung function in 
these patients. Another anti-IL-6 receptor agent, sarilumab, targeting the IL6 
receptor alpha subunit, was recently approved for the treatment of patients with 
RA, although long-term data for this biologic are not yet published. In this 
article we review the placement of TCZ in current treatment guidelines; recent 
clinical trial data, including quality of life in patients with RA; recent 
updates to the TCZ safety profile; recent investigations of TCZ in other 
immunological diseases; and the clinical development of other novel 
IL-6-targeted agents.

The art of doing good. Aging, creativity and wisdom in the Isabel Dalhousie 
novels.

Several studies have examined the interaction between the aging process and 
literary creativity, either to confirm the stereotype that wisdom and experience 
do not compensate for the inevitable decline of intellectual (and all) 
capacities (Lehman 1953; de Beauvoir 1972) or to highlight the empowering 
possibilities of embracing the knowledge and insight of a lifetime to continue 
developing creativity in maturity (Wyatt-Brown and Rossen 1993; Cohen-Shalev 
2002; Casado-Gual, Domínguez-Rué and Worsfold 2016). Not so much emphasis, 
however, has been put on how this new creative stage and the wisdom gained in a 
lifetime can contribute to improving the author's personal and/or intellectual 
fulfilment and, by extension, benefit readers by the sharing of that experience. 
Since wisdom is a quality often associated with old age, it would not be odd to 
assume that the lessons learned from life and career can not only lead the 
artist to a period of renewed engagement, but the sharing of that awareness can 
also inspire readers to get a glimpse of "the good life". One such example is 
the Scottish writer Alexander McCall-Smith (1948). McCall-Smith is currently one 
of the best-loved and most prolific authors in English, having written more than 
a hundred volumes, mostly after the age of fifty. Among such an extensive 
production, this article concentrates on his Sunday Philosophy Club series, 
featuring middle-aged philosopher and amateur detective Isabel Dalhousie, whose 
deep philosophical interrogations and intensely human dimension interrogate 
fundamental notions about ethical living and life at large.

Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) is a conserved apical kinase in the spindle assembly 
checkpoint (SAC) that ensures accurate segregation of chromosomes during 
mitosis. Mps1 undergoes extensive auto- and transphosphorylation, but the 
regulatory and functional consequences of these modifications remain unclear. 
Recent findings highlight the importance of intermolecular interactions between 
the N-terminal extension (NTE) of Mps1 and the Hec1 subunit of the NDC80 
complex, which control Mps1 localization at kinetochores and activation of the 
SAC. Whether the NTE regulates other mitotic functions of Mps1 remains unknown. 
Here, we report that phosphorylation within the NTE contributes to Mps1 
activation through relief of catalytic autoinhibition that is mediated by the 
NTE itself. Moreover, we find that this regulatory NTE function is independent 
of its role in Mps1 kinetochore recruitment. We demonstrate that the NTE 
autoinhibitory mechanism impinges most strongly on Mps1-dependent SAC functions 
and propose that Mps1 activation likely occurs sequentially through dimerization 
of a "prone-to-autophosphorylate" Mps1 conformer followed by autophosphorylation 
of the NTE prior to maximal kinase activation segment trans-autophosphorylation. 
Our observations underline the importance of autoregulated Mps1 activity in 
generation and maintenance of a robust SAC in human cells.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Hereditary angioedema is a rare disease associated with 
unpredictable, recurrent attacks of potentially life-threatening edema. 
Management of severe attacks is currently suboptimal because emergency medical 
teams are often unaware of new specific treatments. The objective of this trial 
is to test whether a dedicated national telephone care-management strategy would 
reduce resource use during severe hereditary angioedema attacks.
METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized multicenter prospective trial of 
patients with a documented diagnosis of hereditary angioedema (type I, II or 
FXII hereditary angioedema). Participants were enrolled between March 2013 and 
June 2014 at 8 participating reference centers. The randomized units were the 
reference centers (clusters). Patients in the intervention arm were given a 
national free telephone number to call in the event of a severe attack. 
Emergency physicians in the SOS-hereditary angiœdema (SOS-HAE) call center were 
trained to advise or prescribe specific treatments. The primary outcome was 
number of admissions for angioedema attacks. Economic evaluation was also 
performed.
RESULTS: We included 100 patients in the SOS-HAE group and 100 in the control 
group. During the 2 years, there were 2,368 hereditary angioedema attacks among 
169 patients (85%). Mean number of hospital admissions per patient in the 2-year 
period was significantly greater in the usual-practice group (mean 0.16 [range 0 
to 2] versus 0.03 [range 0 to 1]); patient risk difference was significant: 
-0.13 (95% confidence interval -0.22 to -0.04; P=.02). Probabilistic sensitivity 
graphic analysis indicated a trend toward increased quality-adjusted life-years 
in the SOS-HAE group.
CONCLUSION: A national dedicated call center for management of severe hereditary 
angioedema attacks is associated with a decrease in hospital admissions and may 
be cost-effective if facilities and staff are available to deliver the 
intervention alongside existing services.

INTRODUCTION: Aceruloplasminemia is an ultra-rare hereditary disorder 
characterized by iron-restricted microcytic anemia and tissue iron overload 
associated with diabetes, retinal and progressive neurological degeneration. We 
describe genotypes and phenotypes at diagnosis, and disease evolution of seven 
Italian patients.
METHODS: Anagraphical, biochemical, genetic, clinical and instrumental data were 
collected at diagnosis and during a long-term follow-up. Mutations, ferroxidase 
activity and Western Blot analysis of ceruloplasmin were performed according to 
standard protocols.
RESULTS: Three mutations were already described (p.Phe217Ser, deletions of exon 
11 and 12), p.Ile991Thr is a very rare variant, p.Cys338Ser and IVS6+1G > A were 
novel mutations. In silico analyses suggested they were highly likely or likely 
to be damaging. At diagnosis, 100% had microcytosis, 86% had mild-moderate 
anemia, low serum iron and high serum ferritin. Four (57%) had type 1 diabetes 
or glucose intolerance, 3/7 had neurological manifestations, and only one had 
early diabetic retinopathy. All but one underwent iron chelation therapy 
requiring temporary discontinuation because of anemia worsening. At the end of 
follow-up, three patients aggravated and 2 developed neurological symptoms; only 
two patients were free of neurological manifestations and showed mild or absent 
brain iron.
CONCLUSION: Aceruloplasminemia phenotypes ranged from classical characterized by 
progressive neurologic derangement to milder in which signs of systemic iron 
overload prevailed over brain iron accumulation. Within this large 
heterogeneity, microcytosis with or without anemia, low serum iron and high 
serum ferritin were the early hallmarks of the disease. Therapeutic approaches 
other than iron chelation should be explored to reduce morbidity and improve 
life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the management of elderly rectal cancer 
patients, and especially on the ability to provide optimal oncological 
treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and results of 
multimodality treatment for rectal cancer in patients 75years and older after 
simplified comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) according to Balducci score.
METHODS: We reviewed the charts of elderly patients who underwent surgery for 
localized middle or low rectal cancer. Patients were classified into three CGA 
groups depending on their functional reserve, comorbidities, geriatric 
syndromes, and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Neoadjuvant therapy was discussed for 27 patients (47%), but only 56% 
of them were treated, including 8, 7, and 1 patient from CGA groups 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively. Fifty-three patients (93%) underwent sphincter-preserving surgical 
resection and four patients underwent abdominoperineal resection (7%). 
Postoperative complications were observed in 21 patients (37%). The 
postoperative complication rate was correlated non-significantly with age 
(<85years: 40.6%; ≥85years: 57.1%; P=0.3), and with the CGA (P=0.64). In total, 
10 patients (18%) had definitive colostomy, including five anastomotic leakages 
(9%), and one incontinence (2%). The total rate of sphincter preservation was 
82% (n=47). The risk of secondary definitive colonic stoma formation was not 
correlated with CGA (group 1: 14%; group 2/3: 16%; P=0.8). Estimated OS at five 
years was 52%.
CONCLUSIONS: After routine geriatric assessment, elderly rectal cancer patients 
have good rates of sphincter conservation and acceptable morbidity/mortality.

INTRODUCTION: Muscle pain has been associated with reduced maximal muscle 
strength, and reduced rate of force development (RFD). Strength training (ST) 
has shown an effect in not only normalizing muscle function but also reducing 
neck muscle pain.
AIM: The aims of this study were to compare muscle function in terms of 
strength, force steadiness in neck flexion, as well as extension, and rate of 
RFD of the shoulder in tension-type headache (TTH) patients and healthy controls 
and to examine the correlation to tenderness. Furthermore, the aim of the study 
was to examine the effect of ST on neck and shoulder functions in TTH patients.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: In all, 60 TTH patients and 30 sex- and age-matched 
healthy controls were included for a case-control comparison. The 60 patients 
with TTH were randomized into an ST and an ergonomic and posture correction (EP) 
control group. The ST group trained for 10 weeks with elastic bands.
RESULTS: TTH patients had a lower extension force steadiness with a significant 
15% higher coefficient of variation (CoV) compared to healthy controls 
(p=0.047). A significantly lower RFD (25%) was noted in the TTH group than in 
the healthy controls (p=0.031). A significant (p<0.01) and moderate correlation 
to muscle tenderness was found. In the intervention, 23 patients completed ST 
and 21 patients completed EP. No significant between-group effect was observed, 
but at 22 weeks follow-up, both groups had a significant within-group effect of 
improved extension force steadiness (ST: p=0.011 and EP: p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: TTH patients showed a deteriorated muscle function, indicated by a 
lower force steadiness and RFD, compared to the healthy controls. The effect of 
ST was not larger than EP as both groups of TTH patients showed some improvement 
in neck and shoulder functions during the 10 weeks intervention and at 
follow-up. Future interventions are needed to elucidate if normalization of 
muscle function can lead to a reduction in headache.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively collected outcome data.
PURPOSE: To compare 5-year outcomes following decompression with fusion (FU) and 
microendoscopic decompression (MED) in patients with degenerative lumbar 
spondylolisthesis (DLS) and to define surgical indication limitations regarding 
the use of MED for this condition.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: There have been no comparative studies on mid- or 
long-term outcomes following FU and MED for patients with DLS.
METHODS: Forty-one consecutive patients with DLS were surgically treated. 
Sixteen patients first underwent FU (FU group), and 25 then underwent MED (MED 
group). The 5-year clinical outcomes following the two surgical methods were 
compared using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Back Pain Evaluation 
Questionnaire.
RESULTS: The degree of improvement (DOI) for social life function was 
significantly greater in the MED group than in the FU group. Although not 
statistically significant, DOIs for the other four functional scores were also 
greater in the MED group than in the FU group. However, patients with a large 
percentage of slippage in the neutral position might experience limited 
improvement in low back pain, those with a large percentage of slippage at 
maximal extension might experience limited improvement in three functional 
scores, and those with a small intervertebral angle at maximal flexion might 
have limited improvement in three functional scores after MED for DLS. 
Therefore, we statistically compared the DOIs between the FU and MED groups 
regarding the preoperative percentage of slippage in the neutral position among 
patients with greater than 20% slippage, the preoperative percentage of slippage 
at maximal extension among patients with greater than 15% slippage, and the 
intervertebral angle at flexion among patients with angles lesser than -5°; 
however, there were no statistically significant differences between the two 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: MED is a useful minimally invasive surgical procedure that possibly 
offers better clinical outcomes than FU for DLS.

There is an ongoing debate as to the maximum number of brain metastases that can 
safely and practically be treated with a single course of radiosurgery. Despite 
evidence of durable local control and favorable overall survival when treating 
10 or more brain metastases with radiosurgery alone, some institutions and 
guidelines still limit radiosurgery to an arbitrary number of metastases. As 
demonstrated by this case report, the number of lesions is not so important when 
the patient's life expectancy is otherwise good and body tumors are 
controllable. In the current era of effective targeted therapies, multi-year 
survival with brain metastases is increasingly common. Treating 37 brain 
metastases simultaneously in a five-fraction stereotactic course is technically 
feasible and in this case, resulted in 100% local and distant control in the 
brain for 18 months ongoing without any additional brain radiation. We discuss 
patient selection factors when treating large numbers of brain metastases, and 
present a possible class solution when using five daily fractions of 6 Gray (Gy) 
with a single plan and isocenter.

The prevalence of obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide. One-thirds of world 
population is suffering from the deleterious effects of excessive fat and 
adipose tissue in their body. At the same time, the average life expectancy is 
becoming higher and higher every decade. Therefore, living healthy and longer is 
the dream for everyone. Simply being obese is not the primary cause for the 
consequence of obesity; rather, the depot where the fat is accumulated, is the 
primary key for the deleterious effects of obesity. Results from historical 
research suggest that visceral fat increases the risk for cardiovascular and 
metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, 
not subcutaneous fat. Therefore, body mass index (BMI), which reflects body 
weight relative to height might not reflect the appropriate size of metabolic 
burden of fat in our body. In contrast, waist circumference, which reflects 
abdominal obesity, would mirror the metabolic burden of fat better than BMI. 
Visceral fat is the marker of ectopic fat accumulation. In this review, I will 
introduce my researches mainly involved in uncovering the clues to the link 
between metabolic health and cardiovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: People with Down syndrome (DS) enjoy a longer life expectancy now 
than they ever have before and are therefore at greater risk of developing 
conditions associated with aging, including dementia.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the phenomenon of dementia in DS.
METHODS: Medline and Google Scholar searches were conducted for relevant 
articles, chapters, and books published until 2017. Search terms included 
Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, dementia, DS, and trisomy 21. 
Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed for further 
references.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Virtually, all subject aged 35 to 40 show key 
neuropathologic changes characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, but only a part 
of them show clinical signs of dementia, usually around the age of 50 years. 
Early signs of dementia in people with DS may be different from those 
experienced by the general population. Failure to recognize this can delay 
diagnosis and subsequent interventions.

Background and purpose - The number of hip replacements in Germany has increased 
considerably during the last 2 decades but lately levelled off with no 
significant increase in operation rates. We analyzed the future trend of hip 
arthroplasty and projected the number of primary hip replacements that will be 
performed in Germany until 2040. Patients and methods - We used prevalence data 
of hip arthroplasty patients from 2010 to 2016 from the nationwide inpatient 
statistics and population forecasts from the German Federal Bureau of Statistics 
up to the year 2040. We used Poisson regression to estimate the expected annual 
number of arthroplasty surgeries with calendar year and patient age as 
covariates to account for differences among age groups and changes over time. 
Results - The number of primary hip replacements performed in Germany in 2040 
was estimated to grow by 27% to 288 x 103 (95% CI 250 x 103-332 x 103) from 
2010. Projected counts were highest for patients aged 60 to 70 years. The 
estimated incidence rate was projected to 360 (95% CI 312-414) per 100,000 
residents. However, incidence rates for individual age classes were found to be 
constant with a slight decrease over time for individual age classes. 
Interpretation - Our findings suggest a growth in the total hip arthroplasty 
count whereas incidence rate remained constant over age classes. We consider the 
future demographic change to an older population as well as the increasing life 
expectancy to be the main reasons for the increasing patient numbers rather than 
a general increase in the operation frequency.

BACKGROUND: The progress of medicine, science, technology, education, and 
culture improves, year by year, quality of life and life expectancy of the 
populace. The modern human has a chance to further improve the quality and 
duration of his/her life and the lives of his/her loved ones by bringing their 
lifestyle in line with their sequenced individual genomes. With this in mind, 
one of genome-based developments at the junction of personalized medicine and 
bioinformatics will be considered in this work, where we used two Web services: 
(i) SNP_TATA_Comparator to search for alleles with a single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) that alters the affinity of TATA-binding protein (TBP) for 
the TATA boxes of human gene promoters and (ii) PubMed to look for retrospective 
clinical reviews on changes in physiological indicators of reproductive 
potential in carriers of these alleles.
RESULTS: A total of 126 SNP markers of female reproductive potential, capable of 
altering the affinity of TBP for gene promoters, were found using the two 
above-mentioned Web services. For example, 10 candidate SNP markers of 
thrombosis (e.g., rs563763767) can cause overproduction of coagulation inducers. 
In pregnant women, Hughes syndrome provokes thrombosis with a fatal outcome
