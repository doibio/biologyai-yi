BACKGROUND: The introduction of nursing care-support devices using robotic 
technology is expected to reduce the task burden in long-term care facilities.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of the rise-assisting robot, Resyone, in 
extending and improving the life space of nursing home residents with severe 
care needs.
METHODS: We performed a feasibility study in which Resyone was used to 
facilitate visits to additional sites in and around the nursing home as part of 
the care package of three residents. Two weeks before and four weeks after 
implementation of the new arrangements, the 30 caregivers involved were asked to 
record transfer times and destinations, while also checking the residents' 
facial expressions.
RESULTS: Before implementation, participants had limited life spaces, but 
afterwards they regularly visited additional destinations including the garden, 
home entrance and corridors, which previously they had not visited frequently. 
The residents' facial expressions became more positive and less negative. This 
study demonstrates that Resyone can enrich care activities in severely disabled 
individuals.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the sustainable use of Resyone would 
improve the quality of care at care facilities. Moreover, the extension of 
otherwise limited life space has the potential to improve care receivers' 
quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled/refractory gout patients are recalcitrant/intolerant to 
oral urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), experiencing frequent gout flares, 
functionally limiting tophi, and low quality of life. Pegloticase lowers urate, 
but anti-pegloticase antibodies limit urate-lowering efficacy and increase 
infusion reaction (IR) risk. Immunomodulator + pegloticase co-administration may 
improve treatment response rates, with 79% of MIRROR open-label trial 
(MIRROR-OL, pegloticase + oral methotrexate) participants meeting 6-month 
response criteria. Exploratory outcomes from MIRROR-OL are described here.
METHODS: Adults with uncontrolled gout (serum urate [SU] ≥ 6 mg/dL and 
ULT-intolerance/recalcitrance or functionally limiting tophi) were included. 
Oral methotrexate (15 mg/week) was administered 4 weeks before and during 
pegloticase treatment (biweekly 8 mg infusion, ≤ 52 weeks). Exploratory outcomes 
included change from baseline (CFB) in number of affected joints, Health 
Assessment Questionnaires (HAQs), and Gout Global Assessments.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients received ≥ 1 pegloticase infusion, with 13 included 
in 52-week analyses (1 enrolled before treatment-extension amendment, exited at 
24 weeks). Three patients prematurely exited due to SU rise; 10 completed 
52-week evaluations (8 completed 52 weeks of co-therapy, 2 completed 24 weeks 
[met treatment goals]). At 52 weeks, SU averaged 1.1 ± 2.5 mg/dL, with 
improvements in HAQ pain and health (CFB: - 33.6 and - 0.7, respectively), 
Patient and Physician Global Assessments (CFB: - 4.6 and - 5.7, respectively), 
and joint involvement (CFB: - 5.6, - 8.4, - 6.0 tender, swollen, tophi-affected 
joints, respectively). Two patients underwent dual-energy computed tomography, 
showing concomitant monosodium urate volume reductions. All patients had ≥ 1 AE, 
with 92.9% experiencing acute flare. One mild IR ("cough") occurred and no new 
safety signals were identified.
CONCLUSION: Pegloticase + methotrexate co-therapy resulted in sustained 
SU-lowering with meaningful improvements in clinical measures, urate burden, and 
patient-reported outcomes.

COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on the elderly, who are 
over-represented among those who suffered severe illness or death. The obvious 
implication is that the share of the elderly in the population significantly 
affects the impact of COVID-19 on the overall health of a country. More 
generally, the elderly share has far-reaching economic and social ramifications. 
In this paper, we perform empirical analysis of cross-country data from 1970 to 
2018 to identify the determinants of the share of the elderly-i.e., those aged 
65 and over-in a country's population. We find that the quality of health care, 
life expectancy, and female labor participation increases the elderly share 
while higher fertility and female education attainment lower the elderly share. 
In addition, we find that the share is higher for high income countries and 
countries in Europe and Central Asia.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic endocrine disease that occurs mostly in the state 
of hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose level). In the recent times, diabetes 
is listed under world's utmost critical health issues. Wound treatment 
procedures are complicated in diabetic individuals all over the world. Diabetic 
wound care not only involves high-cost, but also the primary cause of 
hospitalization, which can lead to amputation thereby reducing diabetic patient 
life expectancy. To lower the risk of amputation, wound healing requires the 
development of effective treatments. Traditional management systems for Diabetes 
are frequently chastised due to their high costs, difficulties in maintaining a 
sustainable supply chain and limited disposal alternatives. The worrisome rise 
in diabetes prevalence has sparked a surge of interest in the discovery of 
viable remedies to supplement existing treatments. Nanomaterials wound healing 
has a lot of potential for treating and preventing wound infections and it has 
recently gained popularity owing to its ability to transport drugs to the wound 
area in a regulated fashion, potentially overpowering the limits of traditional 
approaches. This research assessed several nanosystems, such as nanocarriers and 
nanotherapeutics, to explore how they can benefit in diabetic wound healing, 
with a focus on current obstacles and future prospects.

BACKGROUND: Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 aims to reform health care across the 
Kingdom, with health technology assessment being adopted as one tool promising 
to improve the efficiency with which resources are used. An understanding of the 
opportunity costs of reimbursement decisions is key to fulfilling this promise 
and can be used to inform a cost-effectiveness threshold. This paper is the 
first to provide a range of estimates of this using existing evidence 
extrapolated to the context of Saudi Arabia.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We use four approaches to estimate the marginal cost per 
unit of health produced by the healthcare system; drawing from existing evidence 
provided by a cross-country analysis, two alternative estimates from the UK 
context, and based on extrapolating a UK estimate using evidence on the income 
elasticity of the value of health. Consequences of estimation error are 
explored.
RESULTS: Based on the four approaches, we find a range of SAR 42,046 per QALY 
gained (48% of GDP per capita) to SAR 215,120 per QALY gained (246% of GDP per 
capita). Calculated potential central estimates from the average of estimated 
health gains based on each source gives a range of SAR 50,000-75,000. The 
results are in line with estimates from the emerging literature from across the 
world.
CONCLUSION: A cost-effectiveness threshold reflecting health opportunity costs 
can aid decision-making. Applying a cost-effectiveness threshold based on the 
range SAR 50,000 to 75,000 per QALY gained would ensure that resource allocation 
decisions in healthcare can in be informed in a way that accounts for health 
opportunity costs.
LIMITATIONS: A limitation is that it is not based on a within-country study for 
Saudi Arabia, which represents a promising line of future work.

Plain Language Summary: Healthcare in Saudi Arabia is undergoing wide-ranging 
reform through Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. One aim of these reforms is to ensure 
that money spent on healthcare generates the most improvement in population 
health possible. To do this requires understanding the trade-offs that exist: 
funding one pharmaceutical drug means that same money is not available to fund 
another pharmaceutical drug. This is relevant whether the new drug would be 
funded from within the existing budget for healthcare or from an expansion of 
it. If the drugs apply to the same patient population and have the same price, 
the question is simply, “which one generates more health?” In reality, we need 
to compare pharmaceutical drugs for different diseases, patient populations, and 
at a range of potential prices to understand whether the drug in question would 
generate more health per riyal spent than what is currently funded by the 
healthcare system. This paper provides the first estimates of the amount of 
health, measured in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs), generated by 
the Saudi Arabian healthcare system. We find that the healthcare system 
generates health at a rate of one QALY produced for every 50,000–75,000 riyals 
spent (58–86% of GDP per capita). Using the range we estimate to inform 
cost-effectiveness threshold can aid decision-making.

INTRODUCTION: With the increase in life expectancy of the population, the 
progression of chronic diseases, in particular cardiovascular diseases, 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) and their complications, health and 
medico-social care represents a major public health issue.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to present an overview of the situation of 
the elderly and the current organization of the healthcare system for their care 
in French Guiana.
METHOD: A review of the literature and analysis of the most recent data related 
to demographics, socioeconomics, morbidity and mortality, supply and use of 
care, were carried out. For comparative purposes, these data were compared with 
those for mainland France and the other French overseas departments and regions 
when available.
RESULTS: With an average annual growth rate of +6.7% among people aged 65 and 
over, the highest in France (excluding Mayotte), the aging phenomenon has begun 
in French Guiana, although its population is still young. The health status of 
the elderly in French Guiana, characterized by an early onset of dependency and 
a greater prevalence of silent diseases (arterial hypertension, diabetes, 
hypercholesterolemia), is less favorable than in mainland France. In addition, 
the health and medico-social provision for the elderly remain incomplete or even 
embryonic, with little adapted support for elderly people with NND.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the situation of elderly people and the 
challenges for the health system.

Publisher: INTRODUCTION: Avec l’allongement de l’espérance de vie de la 
population, la progression des maladies chroniques, notamment des maladies 
cardioneurovasculaires, maladies neurodégénératives (MND) et leurs 
complications, la prise en charge sanitaire et médico-sociale représente un 
enjeu majeur de santé publique.
OBJECTIF: Cet article a pour objectif de présenter un état des lieux de la 
situation des personnes âgées (PA) et de l’organisation actuelle du système de 
santé pour leur prise en charge en Guyane.
MÉTHODE: Une revue de la littérature et l’analyse de données démographiques, 
socioéconomiques, de morbidité et de mortalité, d’offre et de recours aux soins 
les plus récentes ont été réalisées. À des fins de comparaison, ces données ont 
été confrontées avec celles de la France hexagonale et des autres départements 
et régions d’outre-mer lorsque celles-ci étaient disponibles.
RÉSULTATS: Avec un taux d’accroissement annuel moyen de +6,7 % chez les 65 ans 
et plus le plus élevé de France (hors Mayotte), le phénomène de vieillissement 
est amorcé en Guyane, bien que sa population reste encore jeune. L’état de santé 
des PA en Guyane, caractérisé par une entrée en dépendance précoce et une plus 
grande prévalence des maladies silencieuses (hypertension artérielle, diabète, 
hypercholestérolémie), est moins favorable qu’en France hexagonale. De plus, 
l’offre sanitaire et médico-sociale pour les PA reste lacunaire, voire 
embryonnaire, avec peu d’accompagnement adapté pour PA atteintes de MND.
CONCLUSION: Cet état des lieux met en exergue la situation des PA et des enjeux 
pour le système de santé.

Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous 
micro-deletion in the WS critical region (WSCR) and is characterized by 
hyper-sociability and neurocognitive abnormalities. Nonetheless, whether and to 
what extent WSCR deletion leads to epigenetic modifications in the brain and 
induces pathological outcomes remains largely unknown. By examining DNA 
methylation in frontal cortex, we revealed genome-wide disruption in the 
methylome of individuals with WS, as compared to typically developed (TD) 
controls. Surprisingly, differentially methylated sites were predominantly 
annotated as introns and intergenic loci and were found to be highly enriched 
around binding sites for transcription factors that regulate neuronal 
development, plasticity and cognition. Moreover, by utilizing enhancer-promoter 
interactome data, we confirmed that most of these loci function as active 
enhancers in the human brain or as target genes of transcriptional networks 
associated with myelination, oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation, cognition and 
social behavior. Cell type-specific methylation analysis revealed aberrant 
patterns in the methylation of active enhancers in neurons and OLs, and 
important neuron-glia interactions that might be impaired in individuals with 
WS. Finally, comparison of methylation profiles from blood samples of 
individuals with WS and healthy controls, along with other data collected in 
this study, identified putative targets of endophenotypes associated with WS, 
which can be used to define brain-risk loci for WS outside the WSCR locus, as 
well as for other associated pathologies. In conclusion, our study illuminates 
the brain methylome landscape of individuals with WS and sheds light on how 
these aberrations might be involved in social behavior and physiological 
abnormalities. By extension, these results may lead to better diagnostics and 
more refined therapeutic targets for WS.

Race-nonspecific resistance is a key to sustainable management of pathogens in 
bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding. It is more durable compared to 
race-specific immunity, conferred by the major genes (R), which are often 
overcome by pathogens. The accumulation of the genes, which provide the 
resistance to a specific race of a pathogen, together with the introduction of 
race-non-specific resistance genes is the most effective strategy aimed at 
preventing the breakdown of genetically conditioned immunity. PCR markers 
improved the productivity and accuracy of classical plant breeding by means of 
marker-assisted selection (MAS). Multiplexing assays provide increased 
throughput, reduced reaction cost, and conservation of limited sample material, 
which are beneficial for breeding purposes. Here, we described the process of 
customizing multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous identification of the major 
leaf rust resistance genes Lr19, Lr24, Lr26, and Lr38, as well as the slow 
rusting, race-nonspecific resistance genes: Lr34 and Lr68, in thirteen 
combinations. The adaptation of PCR markers for multiplex assays relied on: (1) 
selection of primers with an appropriate length; (2) selection of common 
annealing/extension temperature for given primers; and (3) PCR mixture 
modifications consisting of increased concentration of primers for the scanty 
band signals or decreased concentration of primers for the strong bands. These 
multiplex PCR protocols can be integrated into a marker-assisted selection of 
the leaf rust-resistant wheat genotypes.

Endometrial cancer is considered a significant barrier to increasing life 
expectancy and remains one of the most common malignant cancers among women in 
many countries worldwide. The increasing mortality rates are potentially 
proportional to the increasing obesity incidence. Adipose tissue secretes 
numerous adipocytokines, which may play important roles in endometrial cancer 
progression. In this scenario, we describe the role of adipocytokines in cell 
proliferation, cell invasion, cell adhesion, inflammation, angiogenesis, and 
anti-apoptotic action. A better understanding of the mechanisms of these 
adipocytokines may open up new therapeutic avenues for women with endometrial 
cancer. In the future, larger prospective studies focusing on adipocytokines and 
specific inhibitors should be directed at preventing the rapidly increasing 
prevalence of gynecological malignancies.

Cutaneous metastasis as the presenting sign of lung cancer is rare, with a poor 
prognosis and a life expectancy of 3 to 5 months. We present the complicated 
course of a 60-year-old woman with extensive metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer that presented as a back cyst. Due to the benign appearance of the cyst 
and the difficulty discovering the location of the primary malignancy, diagnosis 
and treatment were delayed. Unfortunately, once aggressive treatment was 
initiated at the request of the patient, she died 2 weeks later. This case 
highlights the importance of recognizing cutaneous lesions as a sign of internal 
malignancy and emphasizes multidisciplinary discussion that focuses on the 
patient's quality of life.

OBJECTIVES: To explore whether a societal preference for orphan drugs exists in 
Chinese general public and to quantitatively measure the personal trade-off 
between essential attributes of orphan drugs through a discrete choice 
experiment.
METHODS: A labeled discrete choice experiment was employed to measure public 
preference. Six attributes (impact of diseases on life-years, impact of diseases 
on quality of life, availability of alternative drug treatments, annual cost per 
patient paid by medical insurance, expected increases in life-expectancy, and 
improvements to the quality of life) were identified through a literature 
review, experts' suggestions, and stakeholders' semi-structured interviews, then 
refined through a pre-survey. The current study used a D-efficient design to 
yield 27 choice sets divided into three blocks with nine questions containing 
the labeled treatment (either orphan drugs or common drugs). Information on 
sociodemographic characteristics and individual preferences was collected 
through a web-based questionnaire using convenience sampling. A mixed logit 
model was used to test societal preferences for orphan drugs over common drugs, 
while a binary logit model was used to measure the relative importance of each 
attribute in orphan drug access for the National Reimbursement Drug List and its 
willingness to pay.
RESULTS: A total of 323 persons participated in this study. Respondents largely 
had indifferent attitudes toward orphan drugs and common drugs. The binary logit 
model results showed that 5 of the 6 attributes were significant, except for the 
availability of alternative drug treatments. The most impacted factor was the 
annual cost per patient paid by medical insurance (β = -1.734, odds ratio [OR] = 
0.177). Among non-economic attributes, the impact of diseases on life-years-with 
no treatment, the patient will die in the prime of life (β = 0.523, OR = 1.688, 
willingness to pay = 301,895)-was most concerning, followed by significant 
improvements to the quality of life (β = 0.516, OR = 1.676, willingness to pay = 
297,773).
CONCLUSION: The general public in China does not value rarity as a sufficient 
reason to justify special consideration in funding orphan drugs. When making 
orphan drug coverage decisions, the public prioritized the annual cost, disease 
severity, and drug effects.

BACKGROUND: A "cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate (CICO)" situation is a 
life-threatening condition that requires emergent management to establish a 
route for oxygenation to prevent oxygen desaturation. In this paper, we describe 
airway management in a patient with an extended parotid tumor that invaded the 
airways during CICO using the endotracheal tube tip in the pharynx (TTIP) 
technique.
CASE SUMMARY: A 43-year-old man was diagnosed with parotid tumor for > 10 years. 
Computed tomography and nasopharyngeal fiberoptic examination revealed a 
substantial mass from the right parotid region with a deep extension through the 
lateral pharyngeal region to the retropharyngeal region and obliteration of the 
nasopharynx to the oropharynx. Tumor excision was arranged. However, we 
encountered CICO during anesthesia induction. An endotracheal tube was used as 
an emergency supraglottic airway device (TTIP) to ventilate the patient in a 
CICO situation where other tools such as laryngeal mask airway or mask 
ventilation were not suitable for this complicated and difficult airway. The 
patient did not experience desaturation despite sudden loss of definite airway. 
During tracheostomy, the pulse oximetry remained 100% with our technique of 
ventilating the patient. The arterial blood gas analysis revealed PaCO2 35.7 
mmHg and PaO2 242.5 mmHg upon 50% oxygenation afterward.
CONCLUSION: Using an endotracheal tube as a supraglottic airway device, patients 
may have increased survival without experiencing life-threatening desaturation.

BACKGROUND: A increasing number of studies have revealed associations between 
country-level determinants and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. 
This ecological study was conducted to analyze country-level parameters related 
to COVID-19 infections and deaths during the first year of the pandemic.
METHODS: The examined predictors comprised demographics, economic factors, 
disease prevalence and healthcare system status, and the relevant data were 
obtained from public databases. The index dates were set to 15 July 2020 (Time 
1) and 15 December 2020 (Time 2). The adjusted spatial autoregression models 
used a first-order queen contiguity spatial weight for the main analysis and a 
second-order queen contiguity spatial weight for a sensitivity analysis to 
examine the predictors associated with COVID-19 case and mortality rates.
RESULTS: Obesity was significantly and positively associated with COVID-19 case 
and mortality rates in both the main and sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity 
analysis revealed that a country's gross domestic product, population density, 
life expectancy and proportion of the population older than 65 y are positively 
associated with COVID-19 case and mortality rates.
CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing global prevalence of obesity, the relationship 
between obesity and COVID-19 disease at the country level must be clarified and 
continually monitored.

BACKGROUND: The burden of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is increasing due to 
longer patient survival, better life expectancy of the general population, and 
increasing drug prices. Funding is one of the main concerns in the choice of CML 
medication used worldwide; thus, patient assistance programmes were introduced 
to ensure accessibility to affordable treatment. In this study, we evaluated CML 
drug distribution inequality in Malaysia through patient assistance programmes, 
using pharmaco-economics methods to evaluate CML treatment from the care 
provider's perspective.
METHODS: Patients with CML were recruited from outpatient haematological clinics 
at the national centre of intervention and referral for haematological 
conditions and a public teaching hospital. The health-related quality of life or 
utility scores were derived using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Costing 
data were obtained from the Ministry of Health Malaysia Casemix MalaysianDRG. 
Imatinib and nilotinib drug costs were obtained from the administration of the 
participating hospitals and pharmaceutical company.
RESULTS: Of the 221 respondents in this study, 68.8% were imatinib users. The 
total care provider cost for CML treatment was USD23,014.40 for imatinib and 
USD43,442.69 for nilotinib. The governmental financial assistance programme 
reduced the total care provider cost to USD13,693.51 for imatinib and 
USD19,193.45 for nilotinib. The quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 17.87 
and 20.91 per imatinib and nilotinib user, respectively. Nilotinib had a higher 
drug cost than imatinib, yet its users had better life expectancy, utility 
score, and QALYs. Imatinib yielded the lowest cost per QALYs at USD766.29.
CONCLUSION: Overall, imatinib is more cost-effective than nilotinib for treating 
CML in Malaysia from the care provider's perspective. The findings demonstrate 
the importance of cancer drug funding assistance for ensuring that the 
appropriate treatments are accessible and affordable and that patients with 
cancer use and benefit from such patient assistance programmes. To establish 
effective health expenditure, drug distribution inequality should be addressed.

BACKGROUND: Stroke is the leading cause of death in China, and predicting the 
stroke burden could provide essential information guiding the setting of medium- 
and long-term health policies and priorities. The study aimed to project trends 
associated with stroke burden in China through 2050, not only in terms of 
incidence and mortality but also for prevalence and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs).
METHODS: Data on stroke rates in incidence, prevalence, deaths, and DALYs in 
China between 1990 and 2019 were obtained from a recent Global Burden of Disease 
study. Demographic-specific trends in rates over time were estimated using three 
models: the loglinear model, the Lee-Carter model, and a functional time series 
model. The mean absolute percentage error and the root mean squared error were 
used for model selection. Projections up to 2050 were estimated using the best 
fitting model. United Nations population data were used to project the absolute 
numbers through 2050.
RESULTS: From 2019 to 2050, the crude rates for all measures of the stroke 
burden are projected to increase continuously among both men and women. We 
project that compared with those in 2019, the incidence, prevalence, deaths, and 
DALYs because of stroke in China in 2050 will increase by 55.58%, 119.16%, 
72.15%, and 20.04%, respectively; the corresponding increases in number were 
2.19, 34.27, 1.58, and 9.21 million. The age-standardized rate is projected to 
substantially decline for incidence (8.94%), death (40.37%), and DALYs (43.47%), 
but the age-standardized prevalence rate is predicted to increase by 10.82%. By 
2050, the burden of stroke among the population aged ≥65 years will increase 
significantly: by 104.70% for incidence, by 218.48% for prevalence, by 100.00% 
for death, and by 58.93% for DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: With the aging population in China increasing over the next three 
decades, the burden of stroke will be markedly increased. Continuous efforts are 
needed to improve stroke health care and secondary prevention, especially for 
older adults.

Early adverse environmental exposures during brain development are widespread 
risk factors for the onset of severe mental disorders and strong and consistent 
predictors of stress-related mental and physical illness and reduced life 
expectancy. Current evidence suggests that early negative experiences alter 
plasticity processes during developmentally sensitive time windows and affect 
the regular functional interaction of cortical and subcortical neural networks. 
This, in turn, may promote a maladapted development with negative consequences 
on the mental and physical health of exposed individuals. In this review, we 
discuss the role of functional magnetic resonance imaging-based functional 
connectivity phenotypes as potential biomarker candidates for the consequences 
of early environmental exposures-including but not limited to-childhood 
maltreatment. We take an expanded concept of developmentally relevant adverse 
experiences from infancy over childhood to adolescence as our starting point and 
focus our review of functional connectivity studies on a selected subset of 
functional magnetic resonance imaging-based phenotypes, including connectivity 
in the limbic and within the frontoparietal as well as default mode networks, 
for which we believe there is sufficient converging evidence for a more detailed 
discussion in a developmental context. Furthermore, we address specific 
methodological challenges and current knowledge gaps that complicate the 
interpretation of early stress effects on functional connectivity and deserve 
particular attention in future studies. Finally, we highlight the forthcoming 
prospects and challenges of this research area with regard to establishing 
functional connectivity measures as validated biomarkers for brain developmental 
processes and individual risk stratification and as target phenotypes for 
mechanism-based interventions.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Rhino‑Orbital‑Cerebral Mucormycosis (ROCM) is a 
life-threatening opportunistic fungal infection, which mostly affects 
immunocompromised patients. There has been a notable rise in the incidence of 
ROCM during the COVID-19 outbreak. In this study we described imaging 
characteristics of ROCM in detail, from early sinonasal inflammation to late 
intracranial involvement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, Computed Tomography (CT) 
scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of 48 patients with proven ROCM in 
biopsy or culture were evaluated. All the patients had a history of COVID-19 
infection within the previous three months. The imaging findings were described 
and the frequency of different parameters was reported.
RESULTS: Paranasal inflammation was detected in all the patients on imaging. The 
most common involved paranasal sinuses were ethmoid sinuses (97.9%). On 
diffusionweighted images, restricted diffusion was seen in the paranasal sinuses 
of 81.1% of the patients. In addition, sinus wall bone involvement was observed 
in 87.5% of the cases. The most common anatomical sites for extrasinus 
involvement were the retroantral soft tissue (89.6%) and orbital cavity (87.5%). 
Dacryocystitis in 50%, optic nerve inflammation in 43.2%, globe involvement in 
18.9%, and trigeminal nerve involvement in 16% of the patients were detected. 
There was extension of inflammation through the cavernous sinuses and alongside 
the internal carotid arteries in 24% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Characteristic imaging findings of ROCM not only play a vital role 
in the early diagnosis of this infection, but they also contribute to the 
assessment of the extension of inflammation, which is vitally important in 
surgical planning.

BACKGROUND: High-quality evidence is lacking to support one treatment strategy 
over another in patients with foot drop due to peroneal nerve entrapment. This 
leads to strong variation in daily practice.
METHODS/DESIGN: The FOOTDROP (Follow-up and Outcome of Operative Treatment with 
Decompressive Release Of The Peroneal nerve) trial is a randomized, multi-centre 
study in which patients with peroneal nerve entrapment and persistent foot drop, 
despite initial conservative treatment, will be randomized 10 (± 4) weeks after 
onset between non-invasive treatment and surgical decompression. The primary 
endpoint is the difference in distance covered during the 6-min walk test 
between randomization and 9 months later. Time to recovery is the key secondary 
endpoint. Other secondary outcome measures encompass ankle dorsiflexion strength 
(MRC score and isometric dynamometry), gait assessment (10-m walk test, 
functional ambulation categories, Stanmore questionnaire), patient-reported 
outcome measures (EQ5D-5L), surgical complications, neurological deficits 
(sensory changes, motor scores for ankle eversion and hallux extension), health 
economic assessment (WPAI) and electrodiagnostic assessment.
DISCUSSION: The results of this randomized trial may elucidate the role of 
surgical decompression of the peroneal nerve and aid in clinical 
decision-making.
