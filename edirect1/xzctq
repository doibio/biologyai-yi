according to their intended application, but the efficacy of all current 
approaches following scale-up to commercial conditions is recognized as 
insufficient. The combination of biological and physical methods to maintain 
quality has the potential to overcome the limitations of current approaches. 
This review compares biocontrol and biopreservation approaches, alone and in 
combination with physical methods. The recent increase in the use of meta-omics 
approaches and other innovative technologies, has led to the emergence of new 
strategies to increase the shelf-life of fruit and vegetables, which are also 
discussed herein.

The constant rise in fragility fractures is proportional to the constant rise in 
life expectancy. Treatment of fragility fractures can be challenging because of 
severe fractures, poor bone quality, significant co-morbidities, and reduced 
mobility. However, new surgical techniques and implants have been developed that 
address these challenges and show improvement in overall patient outcomes. This 
review addresses general considerations including nonsurgical and surgical 
treatments of fractures as well as treatment of specific fragility fractures of 
the extremities. Based on these findings, this chapter gives treatment 
recommendations for a selection of common geriatric fractures. The aim of 
treating fragility fractures is on the early mobilization to prevent 
complications such as pneumonia. However, the patient's general situation should 
be taken into consideration while recommending appropriate treatment strategies.

The life expectancy of unresectable hilar cholangiocellular carcinomas (CCCs) is 
very limited and endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (ERFA) of the biliary tract 
may prolong survival. Our single-center-study retrospectively analysed all CCC 
cases, in whom ERFAs of the biliary tract were performed between 2012 and 2017 
and compared these to historical control cases who received the standard 
treatment of sole stent application. ERFA was performed in 32 patients with 
malignant biliary strictures that were mainly caused by Bismuth III and IV hilar 
CCCs (66%). 14 of these patients received repeated ERFAs, for an overall 
performance of 54 ERFAs. Stents were applied after examination of all patients 
(100%). Adverse events occurred in 18.5% of examinations. Case-control analysis 
revealed that the survival time of cases with unresectable Bismuth type III and 
IV hilar CCCs (n = 20) treated with combined ERFA and stent application 
significantly increased compared to controls (n = 22) treated with sole stent 
application (342 +/- 57 vs. 221 +/- 26 days; p = 0.046). In conclusion, ERFA 
therapy significantly prolonged survival in patients with unresectable Bismuth 
type III and IV hilar CCC. As an effective and safe method, ERFA should be 
considered as a palliative treatment for all these patients.

Lord Mountbatten's The Last Supper: How the British empire botched up the future 
of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

The Lancet, a leading health science journal, has published a political 
editorial, raising interest in the impact of British colonization on the current 
status of healthcare, economy and development of the Indian subcontinent. Over 
two centuries, the East India Company and the British empire siphoned out at 
least £ 9.2 trillion; or $44.6 trillion; since the exchange rate was $4.8 per 
pound sterling during much of the colonial period. It is to be noted that the 
life expectancy of Indians at birth was just 22 years in 1911. Food grain was 
available, however the purchasing power of ordinary Indians was being squeezed. 
The per capita annual consumption of food grains went down from 200kg in 1900 to 
157kg on the eve of World War II, and further down to 37kg by 1946 (Prof Utsa 
Patnaik). The Indian sub-continent has still not recovered from the systemic 
malnutrition inflicted upon the population. Today, just under two billion 
people, or a quarter of the earth's population, live in India, Pakistan and 
Bangladesh. The landlocked populations of these countries are known as the black 
hole of humanity, waiting for ultimate catastrophe- either natural or man-made 
humanitarian crisis. What happens to these countries now was determined long 
before and planned by the British empire when their representatives packed bags 
and transferred power to the local natives. The partition of India was the most 
tragic ever human genocide artificially perpetrated in the human history. More 
than 14 million people were displaced and close to two million people died or 
went missing. It was the parting gift by the British empire to the people of the 
Indian sub-continent. This was more tragic than the holocaust. A permanent scar 
and hatred that would not heal even after a century was created by the British 
empire. The 200 years of anti-incumbency and hatred against the British was 
forgotten and used to build a civil war. Enough hatred was fumed between the 
native population of India and Pakistan. This hatred was further 
institutionalized between the two countries by having them develop separate 
militaries. It was a grand exit plan for the empire, leaving behind no traces of 
the crime, while keeping their aura of pride and benevolence intact. After 
seventy years, it is important to revisit the political circumstances prevailing 
during the colonial period. It is important for the people India, Pakistan and 
Bangladesh to think about the future and not be victims of the political game 
rolled out as an exit plan by the empire.

INTRODUCTION: Timely diagnosis and effective treatment, based on epidemiologic 
data, consistently reduce the clinical, social and economic burden of inherited 
erythrocyte disorders.
OBJECTIVE: This article provides an overview on current worldwide epidemiology 
of the most frequent inherited erythrocyte disorders.
METHODS: Information was obtained from Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) 
database.
RESULTS: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency has the largest 
worldwide incidence and prevalence. Sickle cell disorders (SCD) cause the 
highest cause-specific disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Incidence and 
prevalence of SCD have recently increased, whilst DALYs and mortality remained 
stable. All epidemiologic measures of thalassemias have recently declined, 
whilst those of G6PD deficiency remained stable or increased. Africa has the 
highest incidence of G6PD deficiency and SCD, whilst thalassemias are more 
frequent in Western Pacific. The incidence of all inherited erythrocyte 
disorders is increasing in Africa and Eastern Mediterranean, whilst is 
decreasing in South-East Asia, Western Pacific and Europe. Thalassemias and SCD 
display a peak of prevalence and mortality between 0 and 15 years, whilst 
mortality for G6PD deficiencies and other hemoglobinopathies peaks between 45 
and 75 years and >80 years, respectively. Men have higher burden of G6PD 
deficiencies, whilst sex distribution of SCD and thalassemias is similar.
CONCLUSIONS: The worldwide epidemiologic burden of inherited erythrocyte 
disorders remains particularly high.

BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy is associated with dyspnea in cross-sectional studies, 
but associations have not been determined in longitudinal analyses. Statins are 
commonly prescribed but their contribution to dyspnea is unknown. We determined 
whether polypharmacy was associated with dyspnea trajectory over time in adults 
with advanced illness enrolled in a statin discontinuation trial, overall, and 
in models stratified by statin discontinuation.
METHODS: Using data from a parallel-group unblinded pragmatic clinical trial 
(patients on statins ≥3 months with life expectancy of 1 month to 1 year, 
enrolled in the parent study between June 3, 2011, and May 2, 2013, n = 308/381 
[81%]), we restricted analyses to patients with available baseline medication 
count and ≥1 dyspnea score. Polypharmacy was assessed by self-reported chronic 
medication count. Dyspnea trajectory group, our primary outcome, was determined 
over 24 weeks using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 73.8 years (standard deviation [SD]: 
±11.0) and the mean medication count was 11.6 (SD: ±5.0). We identified 3 
dyspnea trajectory groups: none (n = 108), mild (n = 130), and moderate-severe 
(n = 70). Statins were discontinued in 51.8%, 48.5%, and 42.9% of patients, 
respectively. In multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, and 
statin discontinuation, each additional medication was associated with 8% (odds 
ratio [OR] = 1.08 [1.01-1.14]) and 16% (OR = 1.16 [1.08-1.25]) increased risk 
for mild and moderate-severe dyspnea, respectively. In stratified models, 
polypharmacy was associated with dyspnea in the statin continuation group only 
(mild OR = 1.12 [1.01-1.24], moderate-severe OR = 1.24 [1.11-1.39]) versus 
statin discontinuation (mild OR = 1.03 [0.95-1.12], and moderate-severe OR = 
1.09 [0.98-1.22]).
CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy was strongly associated with dyspnea. Prospective 
interventions to decrease polypharmacy may impact dyspnea symptoms, especially 
for statins.

BACKGROUND: Spiritual care is integral to palliative care. It engenders a sense 
of purpose, meaning, and connectedness to the sacred or important and may 
support caregiver well-being.
AIM: To examine caregivers' spirituality, religiosity, spiritual well-being, and 
views on spiritual/religious support.
DESIGN: A mixed-methods study across 4 Australian sites, recruiting caregivers 
of patients with a life expectancy of under 12 months. The anonymous 
semistructured questionnaire used included research team developed and adapted 
questions examining religion/spirituality's role and support and views on 
hospitals supporting spiritual/religious requirements. It additionally included 
the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being Scale 
(FACIT-Sp-12).
RESULTS: One hundred nine caregivers participated (47.4% responded). Median 
spiritual well-being was 30.5 on FACIT-Sp-12. Religious affiliation was 
associated with higher Faith subscores (P < .001). Spirituality was very 
important to 24.5%, religiosity to 28.2%, and unimportant to 31.4% and 35.9%, 
respectively. Caregivers prayed (P = .005) and meditated (P = .006) more 
following patients' diagnoses, gaining comfort, guidance, and strength. 
Caregivers whose spiritual/religious needs were met to moderate/full extent by 
external religious/faith communities (23.8%) reported greater spiritual 
well-being (P < .001). Hospitals supported moderate/full caregiver spiritual 
needs in 19.3%. Pastoral care visits comforted 84.4% of those who received them 
(n = 32) but elicited discomfort in 15.6%. Caregivers also emphasized the 
importance of humane staff and organizational tone in supporting spiritual care.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-based spiritual care providers should seek to identify 
those who seek pastoral or religiously orientated care. Genuine hospitality of 
showing concern for the other ensures the varied yet inevitably humanist 
requirements of the caregiver community are met.

Bone marrow niche crosses paths with BMPs: a road to protection and persistence 
in CML.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a paradigm of precision medicine, being one 
of the first cancers to be treated with targeted therapy. This has 
revolutionised CML therapy and patient outcome, with high survival rates. 
However, this now means an ever-increasing number of patients are living with 
the disease on life-long tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, with most 
patients anticipated to have near normal life expectancy. Unfortunately, in a 
significant number of patients, TKIs are not curative. This low-level disease 
persistence suggests that despite a molecularly targeted therapeutic approach, 
there are BCR-ABL1-independent mechanisms exploited to sustain the survival of a 
small cell population of leukaemic stem cells (LSCs). In CML, LSCs display many 
features akin to haemopoietic stem cells, namely quiescence, self-renewal and 
the ability to produce mature progeny, this all occurs through intrinsic and 
extrinsic signals within the specialised microenvironment of the bone marrow 
(BM) niche. One important avenue of investigation in CML is how the disease 
highjacks the BM, thereby remodelling this microenvironment to create a niche, 
which enables LSC persistence and resistance to TKI treatment. In this review, 
we explore how changes in growth factor levels, in particular, the bone 
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, impact on cell 
behaviour, extracellular matrix deposition and bone remodelling in CML. We also 
discuss the challenges in targeting LSCs and the potential of dual targeting 
using combination therapies against BMP receptors and BCR-ABL1.

Bioenergetics and Autophagic Imbalance in Patients-Derived Cell Models of 
Parkinson Disease Supports Systemic Dysfunction in Neurodegeneration.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
worldwide affecting 2-3% of the population over 65 years. This prevalence is 
expected to rise as life expectancy increases and diagnostic and therapeutic 
protocols improve. PD encompasses a multitude of clinical, genetic, and 
molecular forms of the disease. Even though the mechanistic of the events 
leading to neurodegeneration remain largely unknown, some molecular hallmarks 
have been repeatedly reported in most patients and models of the disease. 
Neuroinflammation, protein misfolding, disrupted endoplasmic 
reticulum-mitochondria crosstalk, mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent 
bioenergetic failure, oxidative stress and autophagy deregulation, are amongst 
the most commonly described. Supporting these findings, numerous familial forms 
of PD are caused by mutations in genes that are crucial for mitochondrial and 
autophagy proper functioning. For instance, late and early onset PD associated 
to mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and Parkin (PRKN) genes, 
responsible for the most frequent dominant and recessive inherited forms of PD, 
respectively, have emerged as promising examples of disease due to their 
established role in commanding bioenergetic and autophagic balance. 
Concomitantly, the development of animal and cell models to investigate the 
etiology of the disease, potential biomarkers and therapeutic approaches are 
being explored. One of the emerging approaches in this context is the use of 
patient's derived cells models, such as skin-derived fibroblasts that preserve 
the genetic background and some environmental cues of the patients. An 
increasing number of reports in these PD cell models postulate that deficient 
mitochondrial function and impaired autophagic flux may be determinant in PD 
accelerated nigral cell death in terms of limitation of cell energy supply and 
accumulation of obsolete and/or unfolded proteins or dysfunctional organelles. 
The reliance of neurons on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and their 
post-mitotic nature, may explain their increased vulnerability to undergo 
degeneration upon mitochondrial challenges or autophagic insults. In this 
scenario, proper mitochondrial function and turnover through mitophagy, are 
gaining in strength as protective targets to prevent neurodegeneration, together 
with the use of patient-derived fibroblasts to further explore these events. 
These findings point out the presence of molecular damage beyond the central 
nervous system (CNS) and proffer patient-derived cell platforms to the clinical 
and scientific community, which enable the study of disease etiopathogenesis and 
therapeutic approaches focused on modifying the natural history of PD through, 
among others, the enhancement of mitochondrial function and autophagy.

This study reports the application of a novel bioprospecting procedure designed 
to screen plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) capable of rapidly 
colonizing the rhizosphere and mitigating drought stress in multiple hosts. Two 
PGPR strains were isolated by this bioprospecting screening assay and identified 
as Bacillus sp. (12D6) and Enterobacter sp. (16i). When inoculated into the 
rhizospheres of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and maize (Zea mays) seedlings, these 
PGPR resulted in delays in the onset of plant drought symptoms. The plant 
phenotype responding to drought stress was associated with alterations in root 
system architecture. In wheat, both PGPR isolates significantly increased root 
branching, and Bacillus sp. (12D6), in particular, increased root length, when 
compared to the control. In maize, both PGPR isolates significantly increased 
root length, root surface area and number of tips when compared to the control. 
Enterobacter sp. (16i) exhibited greater effects in root length, diameter and 
branching when compared to Bacillus sp. (12D6) or the control. In vitro 
phytohormone profiling of PGPR pellets and filtrates using LC/MS demonstrated 
that both PGPR strains produced and excreted indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 
salicylic acid (SA) when compared to other phytohormones. The positive effects 
of PGPR inoculation occurred concurrently with the onset of water deficit, 
demonstrating the potential of the PGPR identified from this bioprospecting 
pipeline for use in crop production systems under drought stress.

While progress in oncology has been remarkable in recent decades, not every 
cancer patient is benefitting from the advances made in treating their disease. 
The contrast in diagnosis, treatment and its outcome between high-resource and 
low-resource countries is dramatic. Africa presents an enormous challenge with 
population growth and life expectancy increasing in many countries as the toll 
of AIDS and other communicable diseases declines. However, there has been little 
investment in capacity of any sort to deal with the current cancer problem, 
never mind the rapid increase in incidence which is underway. This is a critical 
area for investment and not only of a purely financial nature. It is bad to have 
cancer and worse to have cancer if you are poor. The gap between rich and poor, 
highly educated and less educated and the North-South divide is substantial and 
continuing to grow. Radical solutions are urgently needed: the status quo is not 
an appropriate response to the current situation. Recognising that no single 
government or source of philanthropy has the means to solve this problem, new 
models are needed to cope with and improve this situation.

Despite conducting numerous positive psychotherapy (PPT) tests, the effects of 
such activities in participants aged 50 and above have been dealt with by few 
studies. Therefore, the effects of PPT on psychological well-being (PWB), 
happiness, expectancy life (LX) and depression of retired teachers with 
depression, was investigated using a randomized controlled trial. In this study, 
60 female teachers aged 55-80 years, who obtained the lowest scores in the Beck 
Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), were randomly divided into the two PPT 
(n = 30) and untreated groups (n = 30) at the time of entering the study and 2 
months later following their assessments through the Psychological Well-Being 
Scales-Short (PWBS-S), Oxford Happiness Inventory (OHI), Adult Hope Scale (AHS) 
and BDI-II. The PPT and untreated groups took part in 10 group sessions and 
underwent no interventions, respectively. The study was completed with a total 
number of 52 female teachers (n = 26 per group). The PPT group showed some 
effectiveness on the variables of PWBS-S, OHI, AHS and BDI-II in a way that the 
involved retired teachers with depression increased their PWB, happiness and LE 
after PPT training and teachers reduced their BDI-II after intervention 
(p < 0.05). PPT can be used in order to increase the level of PWB, happiness, 
and LX, along with depression symptoms decreasing amongst retired teachers with 
the age of 55, and also more than that.

BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab (VDZ) was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, 
Labor and Welfare in 2018 for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe 
active ulcerative colitis (UC). The comparative cost-effectiveness of VDZ 
compared with other biologics is unknown in Japan. This information could be 
useful for decision makers at the time of repricing biologics for the treatment 
of patients with moderate-to-severe UC.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of VDZ versus other 
branded biologics for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe UC who 
were anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naïve, from the Japanese public healthcare 
payer perspective.
METHODS: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was developed to predict the number 
of patients who achieved response and remission at the end of the induction 
phase and sustained it during the maintenance phase, translating this into 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. Treatment-related adverse events, 
discontinuation and surgery, and their impact on QALYs and costs were also 
modeled. A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis were conducted 
to estimate the comparative efficacy of each treatment versus placebo. Rates of 
adverse events, surgery, surgery complications, and utilities were from the 
literature. Costs (2018 Japanese yen) were obtained from the Japanese National 
Health Insurance drug price list and medical fee table and local claims 
databases. Clinical and economic outcomes were projected over a lifetime and 
discounted at 2% annually.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime, VDZ yielded greater QALYs and cost savings compared 
with golimumab and was cost-effective compared with adalimumab and infliximab 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ¥4,821,940 and ¥4,687,692, respectively). 
Deterministic and probabilistic analyses supported the robustness of the 
findings in the base-case analysis, indicating that VDZ was either dominant or 
cost-effective in most scenarios and replications. The main limitations of this 
analysis include excluding tofacitinib and infliximab biosimilar as comparators, 
health-state utility estimates were obtained from population studies in the 
United Kingdom, and the impact of subsequent (i.e., second-line) biologic 
treatment was not evaluated.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that VDZ is dominant or cost-effective 
compared with other branded biologics for the treatment of anti-TNF-naïve 
patients with moderate-to-severe UC in Japan.

Scapsipedus icipe Hugel and Tanga (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) is a newly described 
edible cricket species. Although, there is substantial interest in mass 
production of S. icipe for human food and animal feed, no information exists on 
the impact of temperature on their bionomics. Temperature-dependent development, 
survival, reproductive and life table parameters of S. icipe was generated and 
integrated into advanced Insect Life Cycle Modeling software to describe 
relative S. icipe population increase and spatial spread based on nine constant 
temperature conditions. We examined model predictions and implications for S. 
icipe potential distribution in Africa under current and future climate. These 
regions where entomophagy is widely practiced have distinctly different 
climates. Our results showed that S. icipe eggs were unable to hatch at 10 and 
40°C, while emerged nymphs failed to complete development at 15°C. The 
developmental time of S. icipe was observed to decrease with increased in 
temperature. The lowest developmental threshold temperatures estimated using 
linear regressions was 14.3, 12.67 and 19.12°C and the thermal constants for 
development were 185.2, 1111.1- and 40.7-degree days (DD) for egg, nymph and 
pre-adult stages, respectively. The highest total fecundity (3416 
individuals/female/generation), intrinsic rate of natural increase (0.075 days), 
net reproductive rate (1330.8 female/female/generation) and shortest doubling 
time (9.2 days) was recorded at 30°C. The regions predicted to be suitable by 
the model suggest that S. icipe is tolerant to a wider range of climatic 
conditions. Our findings provide for the first-time important information on the 
impact of temperature on the biology, establishment and spread of S. icipe 
across the Africa continent. The prospect of edible S. icipe production to 
become a new sector in food and feed industry is discussed.

Northern temperate ecosystems are experiencing warmer and more variable winters, 
trends that are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Despite this, 
most studies have focused on climate change impacts during the growing season, 
particularly when comparing responses across different vegetation cover types. 
Here we examined how a perennial grassland and adjacent mixed forest ecosystem 
in New Hampshire, United States, responded to a period of highly variable 
winters from 2014 through 2017 that included the warmest winter on record to 
date. In the grassland, record-breaking temperatures in the winter of 2015/2016 
led to a February onset of plant growth and the ecosystem became a sustained 
carbon sink well before winter ended, taking up roughly 90 g/m2 more carbon 
during the winter to spring transition than in other recorded years. The forest 
was an unusually large carbon source during the same period. While forest 
photosynthesis was restricted by leaf-out phenology, warm winter temperatures 
caused large pulses of ecosystem respiration that released nearly 230 g C/m2 
from February through April, more than double the carbon losses during that 
period in cooler years. These findings suggest that, as winters continue to 
warm, increases in ecosystem respiration outside the growing season could 
outpace increases in carbon uptake during a longer growing season, particularly 
in forests that depend on leaf-out timing to initiate carbon uptake. In 
ecosystems with a perennial leaf habit, warming winter temperatures are more 
likely to increase ecosystem carbon uptake through extension of the active 
growing season. Our results highlight the importance of understanding 
relationships among antecedent winter conditions and carbon exchange across 
land-cover types to understand how landscape carbon exchange will change under 
projected climate warming.

New processing technologies are gaining popularity worldwide due to several 
advantages related to food safety, shelf life extension, nutritional and sensory 
quality. However, consumers can be cautious of food products produced using 
these technologies. In this context, the objectives of the study were to explore 
consumers' spontaneous associations with fruit juices processed using different 
technologies, and to study the influence of food technology neophobia on those 
associations. A study with 423 Brazilian consumers was conducted to evaluate 
their perception of five types of juices (fresh juice, cold pressed juice, 
pasteurized juice, pressurized juice and non-pressurized juice) using word 
association. Participants also answered the Food Technology Neophobia Scale 
(FTNS) and a series of socio-demographic questions. Results showed that 
consumers' attitudes towards processing technologies were mainly defined by 
top-down processes. Fresh, cold pressed and non-pressurized juice were mainly 
associated with healthy and natural products, whereas concepts including 
references to processing technologies were associated with processed products 
and unhealthiness. Food technology neophobia moderated consumers' perceptions of 
juice processing technologies. Interestingly, consumers with high technology 
neophobia perceived juices processed by both conventional and innovative 
technologies more negatively than those with low or medium levels of neophobia.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a very serious global problem. In Indonesia, 
this disease attacks at the most productive age; consequently, it can reduce 
economic status and life expectancy. The pathogenesis of T2DM is very closely 
related to inflammation and macrophage accumulation. However, no 
anti-inflammatory agent has been proven to play a role in the management of 
T2DM. Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid produced from resistant starch 
fermentation in the intestinal lumen. It is able to bind to GPR41 and GPR43 
receptors on monocytes, so that it can change the pattern of cytokine 
expression, activation, migration and cell differentiation. Hence, it is 
interesting to examine the anti-inflammation effect of butyrate and the effect 
on monocyte migration. A total of 37 subjects were examined in this study. They 
were divided into two groups, with and without butyrate treatment. We analyzed 
two pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF-α and Interleukin 
IL-6) and one anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL 10. Monocytes were isolated in type 
1 collagen gel for migration testing using the µ-slide chemotaxis IBIDI. Image 
analysis used ImageJ and Chemotaxis tool software. There was a significant 
difference in the TNFα/IL 10 ratio between healthy groups and T2DM. Butyrate 
also appears to suppress TNFα cytokine production and increase IL10 production. 
It also decreases the accumulation distance of monocyte migration in T2DM.

Forty-five volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified or annotated in the 
mandibular gland reservoir content (MGRC) of the Southeast Asian ant Colobopsis 
explodens Laciny and Zettel, 2018 (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), using headspace 
solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid extraction combined with GC-MS. In extension of 
previous reports on VOCs of C. explodens, members of different compound classes, 
such as alkanes, aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, and phenolics, were 
detected. The ketone 2-heptanone and the biochemically related phenolics 
benzene-1,3,5-triol (phloroglucinol, PG), 1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)ethanone 
(monoacetylphloroglucinol, MAPG), 5,7-dihydroxy-2-methylchromen-4-one 
(noreugenin), and 1-(3-Acetyl-2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)ethanone 
(2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, DAPG) dominated the GC-MS chromatograms. The 
identities of the main phenolics MAPG and noreugenin were further verified by 
liquid chromatography-high resolution-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). A 
comparative study of MGRC samples originating from three distinct field 
expeditions revealed differences in the VOC profiles, but the presence and 
relative abundances of the dominating constituents were largely consistent in 
all samples. Our study considerably extends the knowledge about the number and 
type of VOCs occurring in the MGRC of C. explodens. Based on the type of the 
detected compounds, we propose that the likely irritant and antibiotic phenolic 
constituents play a role in defense against arthropod opponents or in protection 
against microbial pathogens.

Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common of malignant gliomas in adults 
with an exiguous life expectancy. Standard treatments are not curative and the 
resistance to both chemotherapy and conventional radiotherapy (RT) plans is the 
main cause of GBM care failures. Proton therapy (PT) shows a ballistic precision 
and a higher dose conformity than conventional RT. In this study we investigated 
the radiosensitive effects of a new targeted compound, SRC inhibitor, named 
Si306, in combination with PT on the U87 glioblastoma cell line. Clonogenic 
survival assay, dose modifying factor calculation and linear-quadratic model 
were performed to evaluate radiosensitizing effects mediated by combination of 
the Si306 with PT. Gene expression profiling by microarray was also conducted 
after PT treatments alone or combined, to identify gene signatures as biomarkers 
of response to treatments. Our results indicate that the Si306 compound exhibits 
a radiosensitizing action on the U87 cells causing a synergic cytotoxic effect 
with PT. In addition, microarray data confirm the SRC role as the main Si306 
target and highlights new genes modulated by the combined action of Si306 and 
PT. We suggest, the Si306 as a new candidate to treat GBM in combination with 
PT, overcoming resistance to conventional treatments.
