in Kazakhstan and clinical protocols. Following WHO recommendations, a 
willingness to pay threshold of three times gross domestic product per capita 
was used to assess cost-effectiveness. A discount rate of 3.5% was applied to 
both costs and benefits. To deal with parameter uncertainties and to provide 
robust analysis, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed, randomly 
varying all inputs subject to uncertainty assuming a statistical distribution.
RESULTS: The total costs in the primary prevention (PP) group by ICD 
implantation and in the control group were 8,903,786 tenges and 3,194,414 
tenges, respectively. The discounted total quality-adjusted life-years saved 
(QALYs) in the ICD and control groups were 6.48 and 4.98, respectively. The 
indicator of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio amounted to3791604 tenge, 
which is below the willingness to pay threshold and indicates the 
cost-effectiveness of using ICD as a PP strategy in patients with sudden cardiac 
death risk factors in the health care of Kazakhstan.
CONCLUSION: The ICD for the primary prevention of the development of 
life-threatening rhythm disturbances and sudden cardiac death is a 
cost-effective health technology from the position of a payer in the health care 
system of Kazakhstan.

BACKGROUND: In cancer patients with limited life expectancy, an implant of an 
intrathecal (IT) drug delivery system connected to a subcutaneous port (IDDS-SP) 
has been proposed as a successful strategy, but conflicting results are reported 
on quality of life (QoL). The aim of this prospective observational study is to 
report the effects on pain, mood and QoL of an IT combination therapy delivered 
by an IDDS-SP in malignant refractory pain.
METHODS: Adult patients in which IT therapy was recommended were recruited. An 
IT therapy with morphine and levobupivacaine was started: VASPI score, 
depression and anxiety (evaluated by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System 
-ESAS-), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the 5-level EuroQol 5D 
version (EQ-5D-5L) and the requirements of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) 
medications were registered, with adverse events rate and the satisfaction of 
patients scored as Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC).
RESULTS: Fifty patients, (16 F/34 M) were enrolled (age 69 ± 12). All had 
advanced cancer with metastasis. The median daily VASPI score was 75, the median 
depression score was 6, and the median anxiety score was 4, median PSQI was 16. 
At 28 days, a significant reduction in VASPI score was registered as well as in 
depression and anxiety item. Also, PSQI decreased significantly. The EQ-5D-5 L 
showed a significant improvement in all components at 14 and 28 days. Patient 
Global Impression of Change scores showed high level of satisfaction. A low 
incidence of adverse events and a reduction in BTCP episodes were also 
registered.
CONCLUSION: Intrathecal combination therapy delivered by an IDDS-SP could ensure 
adequate control of cancer related symptoms, such as pain, depression, anxiety 
and sleep disturbances. These effects, with low rate of AEs and reduced BTcP 
episodes, could explain the improvement in QoL and the overall high levels of 
patients' satisfaction.

BACKGROUND: The impact of new lineages and sub-lineages of Omicron on total and 
excess mortality is largely unknown. This study aims to provide estimates of 
excess mortality during the circulation of the Omicron variant in Italy updated 
to July 2022.
METHODS: Over-dispersed Poisson regression models, fitted separately for men and 
women, on 2011-2019 mortality data were used to estimate the expected number of 
deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic. The excess deaths were then obtained by the 
difference between observed and expected deaths and computed at all ages and at 
working ages (25-64 years).
RESULTS: Between April and June 2022, we estimated 9,631 excess deaths (+6.3%) 
at all ages (4,400 in April, 3,369 in May, 1,862 in June) and 12,090 in July 
2022 (+23.4%). At working ages, the excess was 763 (+4.9%) in April-June 2022 
and 679 (+13.0%) in July 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: Excess total mortality persisted during the circulation of 
different lineages and sub-lineages of the Omicron variant in Italy. This excess 
was not limited to the elderly population but involved also working age 
individuals, though the absolute number of deaths was small. The substantial 
excess found in July 2022 is, however, largely attributable to high 
temperatures. At the end of the year, this may translate into 30 to 35,000 
excess deaths, i.e. over 5% excess mortality. This reversed the long-term trend 
toward increasing life expectancy, with the relative implications in social 
security and retirement schemes.

Preservation of public health is the main goal of social progress and 
development of the society. The search for potential opportunities to improve 
individual and public health indicators is a positive predictor of increasing 
the socio-economic efficiency of the society and increasing the healthy life 
expectancy of citizens. The scientific review provides arguments in favor of the 
need for professional collaboration of specialists from various industries in 
order to universally realize the most important right of citizens to protect 
their own and public health. Regulatory legal documents defining national and 
international policy in the field of health protection and forming the general 
vector of development of health care activities were used as the sources of 
information for the formation of the basis of the study. As a result of a 
logical generalization of global and national priorities and trends in the 
development of the healthcare sector, the main prerequisites (determinants) of 
health saving of citizens, adopted by the world community and reflected in 
domestic documents, are formulated. The main prerequisites (determinants) of 
health are defined as: promotion of activities that advantage health protection; 
creation of a single preventive space; specification of the concept of 
"responsible attitude to health"; coverage of the entire life cycle of a person 
and all spheres of his activity in the formation of a responsible attitude to 
health and motivation for its preservation; development of information 
technologies in the field of health protection; expansion of intersectoral and 
interdisciplinary cooperation in order to maintain and strengthen health; 
improvement of public health literacy; transformation of health services from 
the standpoint of health protection; development of human resources to ensure 
health-saving activities. The identified determinants of the preservation of 
individual and public health can act as a theoretical basis for the development 
of a scientific and practical methodology aimed at solving problems of improving 
health through the potential of interdisciplinary interaction of specialists in 
various fields of activity.

CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting health and economies across 
the world, although the nature of direct and indirect effects on Asian agrifood 
systems and food security has not yet been well understood.
OBJECTIVES: This paper assesses the initial responses of major farming and food 
systems to COVID-19 in 25 Asian countries, and considers the implications for 
resilience, food and nutrition security and recovery policies by the 
governments.
METHODS: A conceptual systems model was specified including key pathways linking 
the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 to the resilience and performance of 
the four principal Asian farming and food systems, viz, lowland rice based; 
irrigated wheat based; hill mixed; and dryland mixed systems. Based on this 
framework, a systematic survey of 2504 key informants (4% policy makers, 6% 
researchers or University staff, 6% extension workers, 65% farmers, and 19% 
others) in 20 Asian countries was conducted and the results assessed and 
analysed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The principal Asian farming and food systems were 
moderately resilient to COVID-19, reinforced by government policies in many 
countries that prioritized food availability and affordability. Rural 
livelihoods and food security were affected primarily because of disruptions to 
local labour markets (especially for off-farm work), farm produce markets 
(notably for perishable foods) and input supply chains (i.e., seeds and 
fertilisers). The overall effects on system performance were most severe in the 
irrigated wheat based system and least severe in the hill mixed system, 
associated in the latter case with greater resilience and diversification and 
less dependence on external inputs and long market chains. Farming and food 
systems' resilience and sustainability are critical considerations for recovery 
policies and programmes, especially in relation to economic performance that 
initially recovered more slowly than productivity, natural resources status and 
social capital. Overall, the resilience of Asian farming and food systems was 
strong because of inherent systems characteristics reinforced by public policies 
that prioritized staple food production and distribution as well as 
complementary welfare programmes. With the substantial risks to plant- and 
animal-sourced food supplies from future zoonoses and the institutional 
vulnerabilities revealed by COVID-19, efforts to improve resilience should be 
central to recovery programmes.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study was the first Asia-wide systems assessment of the 
effects of COVID-19 on agriculture and food systems, differentiating the effects 
of the pandemic across the four principal regional farming and food systems in 
the region.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC? The impacts of population aging have 
appeared in China, leading to a marked shift in the major contributors to life 
expectancy. Longevity improvements are now mainly promoted by reductions in 
mortality rates of the aged.
WHAT IS ADDED BY THIS REPORT? This study systematically evaluates both changes 
in mortality rates of major chronic diseases among populations aged over 60 
years as well as their contributions to life expectancy increases in China, from 
2005 to 2020.
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE? The results of this study 
demonstrate that more attention should be paid to health conditions of the 
elderly, especially for the prevention and control of major chronic diseases.

At the present time, information and communication technology (ICT) has played a 
vital role in socio-economic development such as economic growth, literacy, life 
expectancy, and employment levels in societies, however, such development has 
come with various environmental damages perspectives. This study scrutinizes the 
impact of ICT, economic growth, and foreign direct investment (FDI) on carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions in the 44 One Belt and Road Initiative (OBRI) countries 
split into sub-region from 1991 to 2019. This study applied various econometrics 
approaches such as cross-sectional dependence, second-generation unit root, and 
Westerlund panel cointegration techniques are executed to analyze the panel data 
set. The full modified ordinary lease square and dynamic ordinary lease square 
estimators are applied to investigate the long-term influence of ICT 
development, GDP (economic growth), and FDI on CO2 emissions. The empirical 
analysis was performed at a disaggregated level to assess the possible 
environmental influences across the OBRI countries. Overall, the results 
reported that broadband and mobile development have an adverse effect on CO2 
emissions. The finding further reveals that the broadband indicator negatively 
affects CO2 emissions in all OBRI regions except South Asia. Similarly, the 
mobile use indicator protects the environmental quality in all OBRI regions 
except MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and Central Asia. Regarding 
country-wise analysis, broadband has alleviated the pollution level in 21 
countries, while mobile has alleviated it in 15 countries. Moreover, economic 
growth is responsible to increase pollution levels in all panels and regions 
except Europe. Besides, the results highlight that higher FDI reduces 
environmental pollution whereby, the pollution halo hypothesis is supported to 
hold for all OBRI panels and regions except MENA countries. Based on the 
empirical findings, the policymakers and governments of these economies should 
design policies to grow smarter cities, transportation systems, electrical 
grids, industrial processes, and energy-saving production through ICT 
development on a macro level.

Kyrgyzstan: Health System Review.

This analysis of the Kyrgyz health system reviews developments in its 
organization and governance, financing, provision of services, health reforms 
and health system performance. A mandatory health insurance is in place, with 
the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (MHIF) under the Ministry of Health acting 
as single public payer for almost all hospitals and providers of primary care. 
The benefits package of publicly covered services is defined in the 
State-Guaranteed Benefits Programme (SGBP). However, many services require 
co-payments and in 2019 only 69% of the population was covered by mandatory 
health insurance. Health expenditure per capita is one of the lowest in the WHO 
European Region, due to the country's small GDP per capita. Private spending, 
almost entirely in the form of out-of-pocket expenditure and including informal 
payments, accounted for 46.3% of health expenditure in 2019. Financial 
protection is undermined by low levels of public spending for health, resulting 
in financial hardship for people using health services. While there is a 
well-developed network of health facilities, the geographical distribution of 
health workers is uneven and there is an overall shortage of family doctors. 
Access to health services remains a challenge, which has been exacerbated by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. While improvements have been made in recent years, 
communicable and noncommunicable diseases still pose a major problem and life 
expectancy prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the lowest in the WHO 
European Region.

Background Stroke burden characterization studies in low- and middle-income 
countries are scarce. We estimated the burden of stroke and its risk factors in 
Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Methods and Results We extracted GBD 
(Global Burden of Disease) study 2019 data on overall stroke and 3 subtypes 
(ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage) for 20 
LAC countries. We estimated absolute and age-standardized rates of 
disability-adjusted life years, years of life lost, years lived with disability, 
and deaths. The population-attributable fractions of 17 risk factors were 
estimated. All analyses were performed at regional and national levels by stroke 
subtype, sex, and age subgroups. In 2019, the LAC region had the fourth largest 
stroke burden worldwide (6.8 million disability-adjusted life years), 
predominantly attributable to premature deaths (89.5% of disability-adjusted 
life years). Intracerebral hemorrhage was the primary cause of the overall 
stroke burden (42% of disability-adjusted life years), but ischemic stroke was 
the leading cause of disability (69% of total years lived with disability). 
Haiti and Honduras had the highest age-standardized rates. Older adults and men 
had the largest burdens, although women had the highest rate of disability. 
Socioeconomic development level did not influence the burden. The major risk 
factor clusters were metabolic (high systolic blood pressure 
[population-attributable fraction=53%] and high body mass index 
[population-attributable fraction=37%]), which were more influential in 
hemorrhagic events, women, and older adults. Household air pollution was an 
important risk factor in low-income countries in LAC. Conclusions The stroke 
burden and stroke-related mortality in LAC are higher than the worldwide 
averages. However, stroke is a highly preventable disease in this region. Up to 
90% of the burden could be reduced by targeting 2 modifiable factors: blood 
pressure and body mass index. Further research and implementation of primary and 
secondary prevention interventions are needed, as well as integrated national 
stroke care programs for acute, subacute, and rehabilitation management in LAC.

The contamination of ready-to-eat produce with Listeria monocytogenes (LM) can 
often be traced back to environmental sources in processing facilities and 
packinghouses. To provide an improved understanding of Listeria sources and 
transmission in produce operations, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) 
of LM (n = 169) and other Listeria spp. (n = 107) obtained from 13 produce 
packinghouses and three fresh-cut produce facilities. Overall, a low proportion 
of LM isolates (9/169) had inlA premature stop codons, and a large proportion 
(83/169) had either or both of the LIPI-3 or LIPI-4 operons, which have been 
associated with hypervirulence. The further analysis of the WGS data by 
operation showed a reisolation (at least 2 months apart) of highly related 
isolates (<10 hqSNP differences) in 7/16 operations. Two operations had highly 
related strains reisolated from samples that were collected at least 1 year 
apart. The identification of isolates collected during preproduction (i.e., 
following sanitation but before the start of production) that were highly 
related to isolates collected during production (i.e., after people or products 
have entered and begun moving through the operation) provided evidence that some 
strains were able to survive standard sanitation practices. The identification 
of closely related isolates (<20 hqSNPs differences) in different operations 
suggests that cross-contamination between facilities or introductions from 
common suppliers may also contribute to Listeria transmission. Overall, our data 
suggest that the majority of LM isolates collected from produce operations are 
fully virulent and that both persistence and reintroduction may lead to the 
repeat isolation of closely related Listeria in produce operations. IMPORTANCE 
Listeria monocytogenes is of particular concern to the produce industry due to 
its frequent presence in natural environments as well as its ability to survive 
in packinghouses and fresh-cut processing facilities over time. The use of 
whole-genome sequencing, which provides high discriminatory power for the 
characterization of Listeria isolates, along with detailed source data 
(isolation date and sample location) shows that the presence of Listeria in 
produce operations appears to be due to random and continued reintroduction as 
well as to the persistence of highly related strains in both packinghouses and 
fresh-cut facilities. These findings indicate the importance of using 
high-resolution characterization approaches for root cause analyses of Listeria 
contamination issues. In cases of repeat isolation of closely related Listeria 
in a given facility, both persistence and reintroduction need to be considered 
as possible root causes.

BACKGROUND: Sufficient supply of coagulation factors products has significantly 
improved life quality and expectancy in patients with hemophilia. Certain 
difficulties, however, persist when it comes to the treatment of the disease.
AIM: To analyze current therapeutic approaches and identify major unsolved 
issues in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey of 100 adult patients with hemophilia A 
was held.
RESULTS: More than a half of the surveyed sample (59%) are patients aged 19 to 
40 with the severe form of the disease, 73% of respondents receive a replacement 
therapy with plasmatic factors, 42% of patients inject drugs 3 times a week or 
more. More than a half of all age groups with hemophilia have persistent pain 
and limited joint mobility, in 70% of the patients, bleeding into the joints 
occurred 4 or more times within the past year, 47% of the patients with 
hemophilia A are partially satisfied or dissatisfied with their state of health, 
92% of the patients would like to improve their quality of life. At the same 
time, about 1/3 of the patients would like to reduce the frequency of drug 
administration. More than 40% of the respondents did not visit a hematologist 
during the year, 85% do not conduct regular laboratory monitoring.
CONCLUSION: The survey results demonstrate numerous areas of potential change 
pertaining to the approaches towards therapy and to the innovative drugs for the 
treatment of patients with hemophilia.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases are complex 
disorders with a known burden. Currently health systems have different 
approaches to dealing with this issue. The objective of this study is to 
describe the burden attributed to and quality of care for cirrhosis and other 
chronic liver diseases.
METHODS: Data of cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases extracted from 
Global-Burden-of-Diseases 2019. Four indicators, including mortality to 
incidence ratio, prevalence to incidence ratio, disability-adjusted-life-years 
(DALYs) to prevalence ratio, and years-of-life-lost (YLLs) to 
years-lived-with-disability (YLDs) ratio, were defined and combined by the 
principal-components-analysis to construct the Quality-of-Care-Index (QCI).
RESULTS: The global QCI of cirrhosis increased from 71.0 in 1990 to 79.3 in 
2019. The QCI showed a favorable situation in higher SDI countries compared with 
lower SDI countries, with a QCI of 86.8 in high SDI countries and 60.1 in low 
SDI countries. The highest QCI was found in Western Pacific Region (90.2), and 
the lowest was for African Region (60.4). Highest QCI belonged to the 50-54 age 
group (99.5), and the lowest was for the 30.34 age group (70.9). Among 
underlying causes of cirrhosis, the highest QCI belonged to alcohol use, 
followed by hepatitis C and NAFLD with QCIs of 86.1, 85.3, and 81.1.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a considerable variation in the QCI of cirrhosis and 
other chronic liver diseases. Countries with low QCI, mainly located in 
developing regions, need organized action to control the burden of cirrhosis and 
its underlying causes and improve their quality of care.

The global rate of aging is rapidly rising due to the increase in life 
expectancy, and the number of age-related diseases - including eye diseases - is 
increasing. The most common eye conditions affecting people over 50 years old 
are age-related macular degeneration, cataract, glaucoma and diabetic 
retinopathy. Timely and effective treatment of age-related eye diseases requires 
a deeper understanding of the cellular mechanisms of aging.

The biosphere represents the global sum of all ecosystems. According to a 
prominent view in environmental ethics, ecocentrism, these ecosystems matter for 
their own sake, and not only because they contribute to human ends. As such, 
some ecocentrists are critical of the modern industrial civilization, and a few 
even argue that an irreversible collapse of the modern industrial civilization 
would be a good thing. However, taking a longer view and considering the 
eventual destruction of the biosphere by astronomical processes, we argue that 
humans, a species with considerable technological know-how and industrial 
capacity could intervene to extend the lifespan of Earth's biosphere, perhaps by 
several billion years. We argue that human civilization, despite its flaws and 
harmful impacts on many ecosystems, is the biosphere's best hope of avoiding 
premature destruction. We argue that proponents of ecocentrism, even those who 
wholly disregard anthropocentric values, have a strong moral reason preserve the 
modern industrial civilization, for as long as needed to ensure biosphere 
survival.

Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy, causing lifelong 
complications such as painful vaso-occlusive episodes, acute chest syndrome, 
stroke, chronic anemia, and end-organ damage, with negative effects on quality 
of life and life expectancy. Within the last five years, three new treatments 
have been approved: L-glutamine in 2017 and crizanlizumab and voxelotor in 2019. 
We conducted a literature search of these three medications, and of the 31 
articles meeting inclusion criteria, 6 studied L-glutamine, 9 crizanlizumab, and 
16 voxelotor. Treatment with L-glutamine was associated with decrease in pain 
crises, hospitalizations, and time to first and second crises, with a decrease 
in RBC transfusion rate. Barriers to filling and taking L-glutamine included 
insurance denial, high deductible, and intolerability, especially abdominal 
pain. Crizanlizumab was associated with a reduction in pain crises and time to 
first crisis, with reduction in need for opioid use. Adverse effects of 
crizanlizumab include headache, nausea, insurance difficulty, and infusion 
reactions. Voxelotor was associated with increased hemoglobin and decreased 
markers of hemolysis. Barriers for voxelotor use included insurance denial and 
side effects such as headache, rash, and diarrhea. These three medications 
represent exciting new therapies and are generally well-tolerated though price 
and insurance approval remain potential barriers to access. Other studies are 
ongoing, particularly in the pediatric population, and more real-world studies 
are needed. The objective of this article is to evaluate post-approval studies 
of crizanlizumab, voxelotor, and L-glutamine in SCD, with a focus on real-world 
efficacy, side effects, and prescribing data.

BACKGROUND: Isokinetic testing of peripheral muscle function is valid and 
reliable in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether and to what extent isokinetic testing of 
quadriceps function meets pre-defined test criteria in patients with COPD; to 
determine the response to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), and to calculate 
minimal important differences (MIDs) of isokinetic quadriceps function.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 2033 patients with COPD (age: 65±9 years, 
body mass index: 26±6 kg/m2, FEV1: 49±22% predicted) who followed a 
comprehensive PR program. Pre and post PR isokinetic quadriceps function was 
assessed with 30 maximal extension-flexion contractions at an angular speed of 
90°/s on a computerized dynamometer. The chosen anchors were 6-min walk test and 
COPD assessment test.
RESULTS: Pre PR, 27% of the patients performed the isokinetic test incorrectly. 
In male and female patients with a correct pre and post PR isokinetic test, peak 
torque (Δ=10±13 Nm or 9% and Δ=7±9 Nm or 10%, respectively) and total work 
(Δ=263±270 J or 14% and Δ=198±190 J or 15%, respectively) improved 
significantly. There was no change in work fatigue index following PR. Using 
distribution-based calculations, MID estimates for peak torque and total work 
ranged between 6-7 Nm and 97-135 J in males and between 4-5 Nm and 62-99 J in 
females.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current test criteria, three in four patients with 
COPD performed the isokinetic quadriceps test correctly during baseline PR 
assessment. Furthermore, peak torque and total work, but not work fatigue index, 
were responsive to PR and sex-specific MIDs were established.

INTRODUCTION: China has the most people with Parkinson disease (PD) in the world 
and is estimated to have over half of the worldwide PD population. The objective 
of this study was to analyze the corresponding burden of PD in China for the 
past decades.
METHOD: Data on disease burden related to PD in China were retrieved from the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study. The estimated annual percentage 
changes (EAPCs) were calculated to assess temporal trends, and the ratio of 
years lived with disability (YLDs) to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) was 
used as an index to evaluate the healthcare system.
RESULT: Nationally, the burden of PD increased from 1990 to 2019. Although the 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) increased, the age-standardized death 
rate (ASDR) and age-standardized DALY rate both decreased. Age-standardized 
rates of PD in males remained higher than those in females, but trends in ASDR 
and the age-standardized DALY rate for females showed a pronounced decrease. The 
most remarkable increase in the ASIR was in individuals aged 45-49 years, with 
an EAPC of 1.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.21). The YLDs:DALYs ratio 
continuously increased compared with global figures and even with countries with 
high sociodemographic index (SDI).
CONCLUSION: Although ASDR and age-standardized DALY rates for PD have been 
declining, the burden of PD still needs attention as the total numbers have 
increased over the period. Generally, the greater burden of PD was in males. A 
sound health system with services tailored to PD continues to be required in the 
future.

Mortality and Life Expectancy Lost in Canada Attributable to Dietary Patterns: 
Evidence From Canadian National Nutrition Survey Linked to Routinely Collected 
Health Administrative Databases.

Jessri M, Hennessey D, Bader Eddeen A, Bennett C, Sanmartin C, Manuel D.

Using 5 diet quality indexes, we estimated the mortality and life expectancy 
lost, at the national level, attributable to poor dietary patterns, which had 
previously been largely unknown. We used the Canadian Community Health Survey 
2004, linked to vital statistics (n = 16,212 adults; representing n = 
22,898,880). After a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 1,722 deaths were recorded. 
Population attributable fractions were calculated to estimate the mortality 
burden of poor dietary patterns (Dietary Guidelines for Americans Adherence 
Index 2015, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, Healthy Eating Index, 
Alternative Healthy Eating Index, and Mediterranean Style Dietary Pattern 
Score). Better diet quality was associated with a 32%-51% and 21%-43% reduction 
in all-cause mortality among adults aged 45-80 years and ≥20 years, 
respectively. Projected life expectancy at 45 years was longer for Canadians 
adhering to a healthy dietary pattern (average of 5.2-8.0 years (men) and 
1.6-4.1 (women)). At the population level, 26.5%-38.9% (men) and 8.9%-22.9% 
(women) of deaths were attributable to poor dietary patterns. Survival benefit 
was greater for individuals with higher scores on all diet indexes, even with 
relatively small intake differences. The large attributable burden was likely 
from assessing overall dietary patterns instead of a limited range of foods and 
nutrients.

Healthcare data are inherently multimodal, including electronic health records 
(EHR), medical images, and multi-omics data. Combining these multimodal data 
sources contributes to a better understanding of human health and provides 
optimal personalized healthcare. The most important question when using 
multimodal data is how to fuse them-a field of growing interest among 
researchers. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly 
machine learning (ML), enable the fusion of these different data modalities to 
provide multimodal insights. To this end, in this scoping review, we focus on 
synthesizing and analyzing the literature that uses AI techniques to fuse 
multimodal medical data for different clinical applications. More specifically, 
we focus on studies that only fused EHR with medical imaging data to develop 
various AI methods for clinical applications. We present a comprehensive 
analysis of the various fusion strategies, the diseases and clinical outcomes 
for which multimodal fusion was used, the ML algorithms used to perform 
multimodal fusion for each clinical application, and the available multimodal 
medical datasets. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. 
We searched Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to retrieve relevant 
studies. After pre-processing and screening, we extracted data from 34 studies 
that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We found that studies fusing imaging data 
with EHR are increasing and doubling from 2020 to 2021. In our analysis, a 
typical workflow was observed: feeding raw data, fusing different data 
modalities by applying conventional machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) 
algorithms, and finally, evaluating the multimodal fusion through clinical
