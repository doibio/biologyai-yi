to teachers' willingness to teach CT might be their low expectancies of success 
and high emotional costs, e.g., anxiety towards CT. Thus, introducing preservice 
teachers to CT during their university years might be a promising way to support 
their expectancies and values, while simultaneously alleviating their emotional 
costs. Prior CT competences might contribute to these outcomes.
AIMS: We investigated whether a specifically designed seminar on CT affected 
preservice teachers' expectancies and values towards programming.Method: A total 
of 311 German primary school and special education preservice teachers took part 
in the study. The primary school preservice teachers received a seminar on CT 
and programming with low-threshold programming tasks, while the special 
education teachers served as a baseline group. The seminar was specifically 
designed to enhance expectancies and values and decrease emotional costs, 
following implications of research on expectancy-value theory.
RESULTS: The preservice teachers who visited the seminar gained higher 
expectancies and values towards CT and programming compared to the baseline 
group. Moreover, their emotional costs decreased. CT was positively related to 
change in expectancies and values and negatively related to emotional costs.
DISCUSSION: Interventions with low-threshold programming tasks can support 
primary school preservice teachers in finding trust in their abilities and 
values towards CT. Moreover, their anxiety towards CT and programming can be 
alleviated. Thus, first steps in preparing preservice teachers to teach CT in 
their future classrooms can be taken in university.

BACKGROUND: Chronic non-communicable diseases constitute an important public 
health problem that is closely related to behavioral risk factors. The study 
examined the prevalence, burden, and behavioral risk factors relevant to four 
major chronic diseases in Shanxi Province, China. The results obtained could 
provide a basis for the formulation of chronic disease prevention and control 
strategies in north China.
METHODS: A multi-stage random sampling method was used to select 14,137 
residents aged ≥15 years who completed a questionnaire survey and physical 
examination. The disease burden was evaluated using the disability-adjusted life 
years (DALY) index. The extent of disease burden attributable to smoking and 
drinking behavior was analyzed using counterfactual analysis.
RESULTS: The total DALYs due to the four major chronic diseases was 938,100. The 
years of life lost due to stroke accounted for 74.86%; the years of life lived 
with disabilities accounted for 54.0 and 68.1% of the total disease burden of 
coronary heart disease and diabetes. Coronary heart disease attributed to 
smoking (105,600) was the highest, followed by stroke (77,200), hypertension 
(6,000), and diabetes mellitus (5,900). Stroke attributed to drinking (30,700) 
was the highest followed by coronary heart disease (16,700) and diabetes 
(1,100). The disease burden caused by smoking and drinking was higher in men 
(164,000 and 40,700, respectively) than in women (30,700 and 7,300, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence and significant burden associated with 
major chronic diseases in Shanxi Province. Therefore, the need for the 
application of various interventions to control smoking and drinking (the major 
predisposing factors) should be applied to reduce this burden.

Grandparenting as the resolution of kinship as experience.

Miller D(1), Garvey P(2).

Author information:
(1)University College London.
(2)Maynooth University.

This article argues that a population of relatively affluent retired people in a 
small Irish town have employed the possibilities of grandparenting to resolve 
many of the tensions of contemporary kinship. This includes the tension between 
the obligations of prescriptive relationships as against the voluntarism of 
friendship. This is considered against a background shift in kinship studies 
towards a distinction between kinship as a category and kinship as experience. 
Kinship as experience often now comprises a series of deep fluctuations during 
the life course. Experience is also extended by the growth in life expectancy. 
This makes it still more important that the legacy of an individual's prior 
experiences of kinship may be partially resolved through the experience of 
grandparenting. The profound consequences of grandparenting lie not in the 
relationship to the grandchildren but in the possibilities that grandparenting 
offers to recalibrate all other kinship relations. These include the 
relationship with one's own children, the relationship with partners, the legacy 
of one's prior experience of being a parent, and even the memory of the way one 
was parented when a child.

Publisher: Être grands‐parents, ou la résolution des liens de parenté par 
l'expérienceRésuméUne population de retraités relativement aisés d'une petite 
ville d'Irlande a utilisé les possibilités de leur statut de grands‐parents pour 
résoudre de nombreuses tensions des liens de parentés contemporains, notamment 
entre les obligations de relations prescriptives et le volontarisme de l'amitié. 
Les auteurs examinent cette évolution dans le contexte d'une distinction, de 
plus en plus affirmée au sein des études de la parenté, entre parenté en tant 
que catégorie et en tant qu'expérience. Aujourd'hui, l'expérience des liens de 
parenté est souvent soumise à une série de profondes fluctuations au cours de la 
vie. Elle se prolonge aussi avec l'allongement de l'espérance de vie. De ce 
fait, la possibilité que l'expérience antérieure des liens de parenté se résolve 
peut‐être partiellement par l'expérience de la grand‐parentalité devient encore 
plus importante. Être grands‐parents a des conséquences profondes, non pas à 
cause de la relation avec les petits‐enfants mais par les possibilités qu'offre 
ce statut de revisiter toutes les autres relations de parenté : relations avec 
les enfants, avec le conjoint, traces laissées par sa propre expérience de la 
parentalité, voire souvenirs d'enfance de ses propres parents.

Age discrimination, the right to life, and COVID-19 vaccination in countries 
with limited resources.

This paper seeks to develop and apply a simple yardstick based on remaining life 
expectancy to assess whether specific health policies unfairly discriminate 
against people on the basis of their age. This reveals that the COVID-19 vaccine 
prioritization policies of several countries have discriminated against older 
people. Conversely, the exclusion of older people from COVID-19 vaccine testing 
is shown to be non-discriminatory, as is some degree of age prioritization for 
limited acute COVID-19 care. Age discrimination in vaccine prioritization is 
shown to be embedded in wider ageist attitudes in health policy, which give the 
lives of older people a lower social value than the lives of people at younger 
ages.

INTRODUCTION: Aortoduodenal fistula (ADF) is a rare cause of upper 
gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and is usually fatal without intervention. A high 
index of suspicion is required to identify and successfully manage this 
condition.
REPORT: Three cases of ADF following duodenal stent insertion for gastric 
outflow obstruction secondary to metastatic adenocarcinoma are presented. All 
presented with upper GI bleeding and underwent emergency percutaneous 
endovascular aortic stent graft repair (EVAR), with temporary aortic balloon 
occlusion in one case. All were successful in achieving haemostasis. The first 
case, although initially complicated by acute stent thrombosis of the right 
iliac limb, was discharged to a rehabilitation facility and survived for two 
years. The second patient died two days after the procedure from sepsis related 
complications. The third was discharged home six days post-procedure with a 
three month follow up.
CONCLUSION: A high suspicion for ADF in patients with previous duodenal stents 
is required for prompt diagnosis and management. EVAR may increase short to 
midterm life expectancy.

Insulin stimulates atypical protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of the 
neuronal adaptor FE65 to potentiate neurite outgrowth by activating ARF6-Rac1 
signaling.

Neurite outgrowth is a fundamental process in neurons that produces extensions 
and, consequently, neural connectivity. Neurite damage and atrophy are observed 
in various brain injuries and disorders. Understanding the intrinsic pathways of 
neurite outgrowth is essential for developing strategies to stimulate neurite 
regeneration. Insulin is a pivotal hormone in the regulation of glucose 
homeostasis. There is increasing evidence for the neurotrophic functions of 
insulin, including the induction of neurite outgrowth. However, the associated 
mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that insulin potentiates neurite 
outgrowth mediated by the small GTPases ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and 
Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) through the neuronal adaptor 
FE65. Moreover, insulin enhances atypical protein kinase Cι/λ (PKCι/λ) 
activation and FE65 phosphorylation at serine 459 (S459) in neurons and mouse 
brains. In vitro and cellular assays show that PKCι/λ phosphorylated FE65 at 
S459. Consistently, insulin potentiates FE65 S459 phosphorylation only in the 
presence of PKCι/λ. Phosphomimetic studies show that an FE65 S459E mutant 
potently activates ARF6, Rac1, and neurite outgrowth. Notably, this 
phosphomimetic mutation enhances the FE65-ARF6 interaction, a process that 
promotes ARF6-Rac1-mediated neurite outgrowth. Likewise, insulin treatment and 
PKCι/λ overexpression potentiate the FE65-ARF6 interaction. Conversely, PKCι/λ 
knockdown suppresses the stimulatory effect of FE65 on ARF6-Rac1-mediated 
neurite outgrowth. The effect of insulin on neurite outgrowth is also markedly 
attenuated in PKCι/λ knockdown neurons, in the presence and absence of FE65. Our 
findings reveal a novel mechanism linking insulin with ARF6-Rac1-dependent 
neurite extension through the PKCι/λ-mediated phosphorylation of FE65.

OBJECTIVE: Class III obesity (body mass index >40 kg/m2 ) is associated with 
higher complications following total knee replacement (TKR), and weight loss is 
recommended. We aimed to establish the cost-effectiveness of Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), and lifestyle nonsurgical 
weight loss (LNSWL) interventions in knee osteoarthritis patients with class III 
obesity considering TKR.
METHODS: Using the Osteoarthritis Policy model and data from published 
literature to derive model inputs for RYGB, LSG, LNSWL, and TKR, we assessed the 
long-term clinical benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of weight-loss 
interventions for patients with class III obesity considering TKR. We assessed 
the following strategies with a health care sector perspective: 1) no weight 
loss/no TKR, 2) immediate TKR, 3) LNSWL, 4) LSG, and 5) RYGB. Each weight-loss 
strategy was followed by annual TKR reevaluation. Primary outcomes were cost, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs), discounted at 3% per year. We conducted deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of conclusions to 
input uncertainty.
RESULTS: LSG increased QALE by 1.64 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
lifetime medical costs by $17,347 compared to no intervention, leading to an 
ICER of $10,600/QALY. RYGB increased QALE by 0.22 and costs by $4,607 beyond 
LSG, resulting in an ICER of $20,500/QALY. Relative to immediate TKR, LSG and 
RYGB delayed and decreased TKR utilization. In the probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, RYGB was cost-effective in 67% of iterations at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: For patients with class III obesity considering TKR, RYGB provides 
good value while immediate TKR without weight loss is not economically 
efficient.

Lung cancer is one of the primary causes of death with poor life expectancy 
after diagnosis. History of past respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic 
obstructive lung disease (COPD), emphysema, and chronic bronchitis can increase 
the risk of lung cancer. Very few studies are available to simultaneously assess 
multiple respiratory diseases and lung cancer. The objective of this study was 
to investigate correlations between asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and 
chronic obstructive lung disease with lung cancer in the US adult population. 
This was a cross-sectional study using data from a total of 23,523 adult 
participants from the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) 
datasets for seven cycles ranging from 2003-2004 to 2015-2016. To analyze the 
data, specialized weighted complex survey logit regressions were conducted. 
Linear logit regression models using only main-effects were constructed first to 
assess the correlation between the selected demographic and lifestyle variables 
and asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and COPD. A second set of linear, 
main-effects logit regression models were constructed to examine the correlation 
between lung cancer and asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, COPD when 
corrected for the selected covariates. The study identified positive 
correlations between emphysema, chronic bronchitis, COPD, and lung cancer. No 
correlation between asthma and lung cancer was established. Of the covariates 
studied, race/ethnicity, marital status, highest educational level, age, family 
income to poverty ratio, and lifetime smoking were also found to be correlated 
with the presence of lung cancer. Correlations between the covariates gender, 
body mass index, alcohol consumption, and country of birth and lung cancer were 
not found. The study established statistically significant correlations between 
lung cancer and the lung diseases emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and COPD. The 
lack of association between asthma and lung cancer may arise from the timeline 
of diagnosis asthma or type of lung cancer. The study also established 
significant correlations between lung cancer and several of the covariates 
included in the analysis. It also established correlations between the 
covariates and the lung diseases asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and 
COPD.

AIM: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 
1 mg versus insulin aspart in the UK.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Long-term outcomes were projected over patients' 
lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (vers 9.0). SUSTAIN 11 was used to 
inform baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects. Patients were 
modelled to receive once-weekly semaglutide plus basal insulin for 3 years 
before intensifying to basal-bolus insulin, compared with basal-bolus insulin 
for lifetimes in the aspart arm. Costs were accounted from a healthcare payer 
perspective in the UK, expressed in 2021 pounds sterling (GBP).
RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with improvements in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.18 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
versus insulin aspart, due to a reduced incidence and delayed time to onset of 
diabetes-related complications. Direct costs were estimated to be GBP 800 higher 
with semaglutide, with higher treatment costs partially offset by cost savings 
from avoidance of diabetes-related complications. Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg 
was therefore associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 
4457 per QALY gained versus insulin aspart.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP 20 000 per QALY 
gained, once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was projected to be highly cost-effective 
versus insulin aspart for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the UK.

BACKGROUND: Changes in storage temperature and time alter the functional 
properties of egg white powder (EWP) and determine its quality and shelf-life, 
finally affecting the consumer acceptance of the products made from EWP. In the 
present study, the EWP samples were stored at four different temperatures (-20, 
4, 25 and 37 °C) for 60 days, and then the protein structural, physical and 
functional properties of EWP were measured and assessed further for correlation 
with storage conditions using heatmap.
RESULTS: The viscosity of the EWP solution increased after 30 days. Foaming 
ability and rheological properties increased first and then decreased compared 
to untreated samples with the prolonged storage time. Correlation analysis 
results indicated that the gel hardness, water holding capacity, foaming 
ability, emulsifying ability, particle size, dispersibility and viscosity of EWP 
were significantly related to storage time (P < 0.05). Only the gelation 
properties of EWP stored at 37 °C for 60 days changed significantly and were 
negatively related to its moisture content (P < 0.05). Additionally, the random 
coil content of EWP was positively correlated with particle size, moisture 
content, solubility and gel properties, whereas β-sheet was negatively 
correlated with them.
CONCLUSION: Compared to other temperatures, the functional properties of EWP 
were relatively stable under 4 °C. Therefore, the low temperature (4 °C) was 
selected as the most suitable storage temperature for EWP. The results of the 
present study could provide a theoretical basis for the shelf-life extension of 
EWP. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is the first medication to demonstrate clinical 
benefit in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, but its 
cost-effectiveness is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
adding empagliflozin to standard therapy in patients with heart failure with 
preserved ejection fraction.
METHODS: A Markov model from the perspective of the Australian health care 
system was constructed to compare empagliflozin plus standard care to standard 
care alone among a hypothetical cohort of patients with heart failure with 
preserved ejection fraction. Clinical probabilities were derived from The 
EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart 
Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction). Costs and utilities were derived from 
published sources. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model uncertainty. Costs and 
benefits were discounted at 5% annually.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime, the addition of empagliflozin to standard care 
prevented 167 heart failure hospitalizations and 155 heart failure-related 
urgent care visits for every 1000 patients treated and increased mean 
quality-adjusted survival by 0.16 quality adjusted life-years per patient. Mean 
lifetime costs in the empagliflozin and standard care groups were AUD$63 218 and 
AUD$58 478 per patient, respectively. This resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of AUD$29 202 per quality adjusted life-year gained. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses, empagliflozin was cost-effective in 85% of 
10 000 Monte Carlo simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD$50 000 
per quality adjusted life-year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, 
adding empagliflozin to standard care is likely to be cost-effective when 
compared with standard care alone in the Australian health care setting.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Rectal metastasis of prostate cancer origin is 
exceedingly rare. Its clinical presentation, endoscopic morphology, and 
histopathology are similar to primary rectal cancer. Misdiagnosis may lead to 
inappropriate treatment.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a gentleman in his 80's with a history of 
treated prostate cancer T3aN0M0 with radical prostatectomy sixteen years ago. He 
presented with one-year complaints of altered bowel habits and weight loss. 
Physical and rectal examination was unremarkable. Colonoscopy manifested some 
inflammatory changes in the rectum. The pelvis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
showed an abnormal posterior rectal wall thickening 2 cm above the anal canal. 
Biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of prostate origin. The 
staging workup was negative for other distant metastasis. After a 
multidisciplinary decision, the patient was started on androgen deprivation 
therapy and given palliative radiotherapy to the rectum. Six weeks later, the 
patient was stable with mild radiation proctitis.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Management of rectal metastasis varies depending on the 
patient's choice, the extent of metastatic burden, symptoms, age, life 
expectancy, quality of life and comorbidities. While surgery remains the 
standard of care, other option including radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and 
chemotherapy has been documented in the literature with survival of few weeks to 
2 years.
CONCLUSION: Delayed rectal metastasis of prostate cancer after radical 
prostatectomy is a rare entity. Its clinical presentation and endoscopic and 
histopathological findings of rectal metastasis are similar to primary 
colorectal cancer, making diagnosis more demanding.

Rack1 features seven WD40 repeats that fold into a multifaceted scaffold used to 
build signaling complexes in a context-dependent manner. Previous in vitro 
studies have revealed associations between Rack1 and many other proteins. Rack 1 
is required for establishing planar cell polarity (PCP) in zebrafish and 
Xenopus. However, any molecular role of Rack1 in protein complexes or polarity 
regulation remains unclear. Here, we show that Rack1 is an essential gene in 
mice. Conditional knockout of Rack1 shortened the cochlear duct and induced 
cellular patterning defects characteristic of defective convergent extension 
(this PCP process is mediated by cellular junctional remodeling in the 
developing cochlear epithelium). Also, cochlear hair cells were no longer 
uniformly oriented in Rack1 conditional knockout mutants. Rack1 was enriched in 
the cellular cortices of sensory hair cells. In Rack1-deficient cochleae, 
E-cadherin expression at the cellular boundaries was greatly reduced. Together, 
the findings reveal a molecular role of Rack1 in PCP signaling that likely 
involves modulation of E-cadherin levels at the adherens junctions of the plasma 
membrane.

OBJECTIVE: To review the epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management 
of head and neck paragangliomas.
METHODS: A literature review of english language papers with focus on most 
current literature.
RESULTS: Paragangliomas (PGLs) are a group of neuroendocrine tumors that arise 
in the parasympathetic or sympathetic ganglia. Head and neck PGLs (HNPGLs) 
comprise 65% to 70% of all PGLs and account for 0.6% of all head and neck 
cancers. The majority of HNPGLs are benign, and 6% to 19% of all HNPGLs develop 
metastasis outside the tumor site and significantly compromise survival. PGLs 
can have a familial etiology with germline sequence variations in different 
susceptibility genes, with the gene encoding succinate dehydrogenase being the 
most common sequence variation, or they can arise from somatic sequence 
variations or fusion genes. Workup includes biochemical testing to rule out 
secretory components, although it is rare in HNPGLs. In addition, imaging 
modalities, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, help in 
monitoring in surgical planning. Functional imaging with DOTATATE-positron 
emission tomography, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, or 18F-fluorohydroxyphenylalanine 
may be necessary to rule out sites of metastases. The management of HNPGLs is 
complex depending on pathology, location, and aggressiveness of the tumor. 
Treatment ranges from observation to resection to systemic treatment. Similarly, 
the prognosis ranges from a normal life expectancy to a 5-year survival of 11.8% 
in patients with distant metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Our review is a comprehensive summary of the incidence, mortality, 
pathogenesis, presentation, workup and management of HNPGLs.

BACKGROUND: Natural space is associated with reduced risk of, and narrower 
socioeconomic inequalities in, diseases that affect older populations, and some 
contributors to premature mortality in younger individuals. Burden of disease 
measures such as years of life lost (YLL) are influenced by premature poor 
health and death. We hypothesised some association between natural space and 
both rates of and inequalities in YLL might be present.
METHODS: The outcome data were the YLL component from Scottish Burden of Disease 
2016, provided at small-area level (datazone) for males and females under 65 
years of age in Scotland, UK. Exposure variables were the percentages of land 
cover within each datazone defined as 'natural space' (NS), and 'natural space 
and private gardens' (NSG). Together with a measure of area income deprivation, 
these were fitted in a multilevel Poisson model accounting for intra-datazone 
level variation, and spatial autocorrelation between datazones.
RESULTS: An increased percentage cover of NSG was associated with lower YLL in 
males (incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.993, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.989 to 
0.997) and females (IRR 0.993, CrI 0.987 to 0.998); each 10% increase of natural 
space cover was associated with a 7% decrease in the incidence rate. An 
increased amount of natural space within local areas was associated with reduced 
disparity in YLL between the most and least income deprived areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The health benefits of natural space also apply when indicators 
sensitive to health events at younger ages are used. An increased amount of 
natural space within local areas has the potential to reduce the disparity in 
YLL between the most and least income deprived areas-the 'equigenic' effect.

BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated a higher risk of developing colorectal 
cancer (CRC) in individuals with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), and also a potentially 
increased risk in carriers of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) mutations. Life expectancy for those with CF is rising, 
increasing the number at risk of developing CRC.
METHODS: The incidence of CRC amongst individuals with CF was calculated using 
data from CORECT-R and linked UK CF Registry and Secondary User Services (SUS) 
data. Crude, age-specific and age-standardised rates were compared to those 
without CF. The presence of CFTR mutations in individuals with CRC was assessed 
using 100,000 Genomes Project data.
FINDINGS: The crude incidence rate of CRC in the CF population was 0.29 per 
1,000 person-years (28 cases). The CF population were significantly younger than 
those without (median age at CRC diagnosis 52 years versus 73 years; p<0·01). 
When age-adjusted, there was a 5-fold increased CRC incidence amongst 
individuals with CF compared to those without (SIR 5.0 95%CI 3.2-6.9). When 
compared to other population studies the overall prevalence of CFTR mutations in 
the CRC population was significantly higher than expected (p<0·01).
INTERPRETATION: CF is linked to an increased risk of CRC. The incidence of CFTR 
mutations in the CRC population is higher than would be expected, suggesting an 
association between CFTR function and CRC risk. Further research is needed to 
develop effective screening strategies for these populations.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is heterogeneous and its molecular 
characteristics remain elusive. We integrated transcriptomic sequencing, genomic 
analysis and clinicopathologic information from 582 tissue samples of 216 PTC 
and 75 benign thyroid nodule (BTN) patients. We discovered four subtypes of PTC 
including Immune-enriched Subtype, BRAF-enriched Subtype, Stromal Subtype and 
CNV-enriched Subtype. Molecular subtypes were validated in an external cohort of 
497 PTC cases from the TCGA. Tumors in the Immune-enriched Subtype showed higher 
immune infiltration and overexpression of immune checkpoints, whilst 
BRAF-enriched Subtype showed a higher tendency for extrathyroidal extension and 
more advanced TNM stage. Key oncogenes including LRRK2, SLC34A2, MUC1, FOXQ1 and 
KRT19 were overexpressed and enriched in oncogenic MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling 
pathways in BRAF-enriched subtype. Further analysis of BRAF-enriched Subtype 
identified three subclasses with different degrees of malignancies. We also 
uncovered the molecular link of the initiation and progression from BTN to 
subtypes of PTC using trajectory analysis. Moreover, a 20-gene expression 
signature was generated for differential diagnosis of PTC from BTN patients. 
Together, our work identified previously unreported molecular subtypes of PTC, 
offering opportunities to stratify patients into optimal treatment plans based 
on molecular subtyping.

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented rise in mortality that 
translated into life expectancy losses around the world, with only a few 
exceptions. We estimate life expectancy changes in 29 countries since 2020 
(including most of Europe, the United States and Chile), attribute them to 
mortality changes by age group and compare them with historic life expectancy 
shocks. Our results show divergence in mortality impacts of the pandemic in 
2021. While countries in western Europe experienced bounce backs from life 
expectancy losses of 2020, eastern Europe and the United States witnessed 
sustained and substantial life expectancy deficits. Life expectancy deficits 
during fall/winter 2021 among people ages 60+ and <60 were negatively correlated 
with measures of vaccination uptake across countries (r60+ = -0.86; two-tailed 
P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, -0.94 to -0.69; r<60 = -0.74; two-tailed 
P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, -0.88 to -0.46). In contrast to 2020, the 
age profile of excess mortality in 2021 was younger, with those in under-80 age 
groups contributing more to life expectancy losses. However, even in 2021, 
registered COVID-19 deaths continued to account for most life expectancy losses.

BACKGROUNDS: This research intended to explore the effects of different frozen 
storage temperatures and time on the stability of steamed bread. The quality 
characteristics, moisture content and microstructure of steamed bread were 
determined after quick-frozen for 30 min at -32 °C and frozen storage at -6, 
-12, -18, -24 and -30 °C for 1-4 weeks.
RESULTS: When the frozen storage temperature is lower, the moisture content, 
specific volume, pH and the strong bound water in the steamed bread increase, 
the water loss rate and the contents of freezable water, the weak bound water 
and free water decreased. With the extension of frozen storage time, the pH 
value and water loss of steamed bread first increased and then decreased, while 
the trend of water content was opposite. The specific volume, cohesion and 
elasticity of steamed bread decreased, while the freezable water content, 
hardness and chewiness increased. The bound water of steamed bread gradually 
migrated to free water. In addition, the longer the frozen storage time and the 
higher the temperature, and the more serious the damage to the microstructure 
was.
CONCLUSION: The shelf life of steamed bread frozen storage at -12 °C could be up 
to 3 weeks, and the quality of steamed bread stored at -30 °C for more than 
3 weeks was the best. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

BACKGROUND: Present guidelines recommend a life-long therapy with mepolizumab in 
patients suffering from severe eosinophilic asthma as several studies proved the 
disadvantages of treatment cessation. This study evaluated the possibility of 
extending the dosage intervals of mepolizumab in those patients with severe 
eosinophilic asthma after being well controlled.
METHODS: Eighteen patients diagnosed with severe eosinophilic asthma were 
started on treatment with mepolizumab in regular 4-week intervals. Symptom 
control was measured using the asthma control test (ACT) and pulmonary function 
test every 3 months. The amount of oral corticosteroids needed to maintain 
symptom control was monitored at every visit. After achieving good symptom 
control, defined as well controlled ACT ≥20, injection intervals were prolonged 
from 4 up to 6 to 8 weeks. The evaluation of this data was approved by the 
ethics committee.
RESULTS: ACT and pulmonary function values significantly improved after 
initiating therapy with mepolizumab on a regular 4-weekly injection interval. 
After extending the dosage intervals, both ACT and pulmonary function remained 
on a stable level without significant changes during the follow-up visits for 1 
year. Median dosage of prednisolone declined significantly in the studied group 
under mepolizumab therapy and stayed on a low level during the follow-up visits 
with only a single patient using prednisolone after 1 year.
CONCLUSION: In patients with fully or well controlled eosinophilic asthma 
treated with mepolizumab extending the dosage intervals between the injections 
up to 8 weeks bears the potential to save costs for the health care system.
