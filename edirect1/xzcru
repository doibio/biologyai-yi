anti-inflammatory mechanism studies showed that SMU-8c significantly 
down-regulated the levels of Pam3CSK4 triggered TNF-α cytokine in human 
THP-1 cells, mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages, as well as in ex-vivo human peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with no influence on cell viability. SMU-8c 
specifically blocked the Pam3CSK4 ignited secreted embryonic alkaline 
phosphatase (SEAP) signaling with no influence to Poly I:C or LPS triggered TLR3 
or TLR4 signaling. Moreover, SMU-8c suppressed TLR2 in HEK-Blue hTLR2 cells and 
inhibited the formation of TLR1-TLR2, and TLR2-TLR6 complex in human PBMC. In 
summary, SMU-8c inhibited the TLR2 signaling pathway to down-regulate the 
inflammation cytokines, such as NO, SEAP and TNF-α, to realize its 
anti-inflammatory activity.

INTRODUCTION: Adults with severe mental illness (SMI) have reduced life 
expectancy and many have comorbid physical health conditions. Primary care 
providers are experiencing increased demands for care for people with SMI. 
Barriers to accessing physical healthcare have been identified which negatively 
affect quality of care. We propose that peer support workers (PSWs) could 
deliver an intervention to service users to promote their physical health by 
drawing on existing social support. The aim of this research was to pilot a 
novel PSW-led intervention, including personal well-being network mapping, to 
improve access to primary care for physical health needs.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Twenty-four participants will be recruited from 
community-based mental health teams in two boroughs of London. Each participant 
will be offered a six-session intervention. Quantitative data will be collected 
before and after intervention (at 4-month follow-up). Qualitative interviews 
will be conducted with PSWs after completion of the intervention and with 
participants at a 4-month follow-up. Some intervention sessions will be observed 
by a member of the research team. This is a pilot study with a small sample 
aiming to assess acceptability and feasibility of an intervention. We aim to use 
the results to refine the existing theory of change and to optimise the 
intervention and its evaluation in a future randomised controlled trial. This 
study is strengthened by its potential clinical importance and origin in 
previous research where service users engaged with well-being network mapping.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the London-Chelsea 
Regional Ethics Committee (ref: 17/LO/0585). The findings will be disseminated 
to participants, the National Health Service trusts that we recruited from, 
primary care mental health leads, commissioners and in peer-reviewed journals 
and academic conferences.

Cost-effectiveness and satisfaction following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: 
does age matter?

AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of age on the 
cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 112 patients were prospectively monitored for 
two years after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using the Disabilities of the 
Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH), the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), 
and the EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D). Complications and use of 
healthcare resources were recorded. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was used to express the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). 
Propensity score-matching was used to compare those aged below and above 65 
years of age. Satisfaction was determined using the Net Promoter Score (NPS). 
Linear regression was used to identify variables that influenced the outcome at 
two years postoperatively.
RESULTS: A total of 92 patients (82.1%) completed the follow-up. Their mean age 
was 59.5 years (sd 9.7, 41 to 78). There were significant improvements in the 
mean DASH (preoperative 47.6 vs one-year 15.3; p < 0.001) and OSS scores (26.5 
vs 40.5; p < 0.001). Functional improvements were maintained with no significant 
change between one and two years postoperatively. The mean preoperative EQ-5D 
was 0.54 increasing to 0.81 at one year (p < 0.001) and maintained at 0.86, two 
years postoperatively. There was no significant difference between those aged 
below or above 65 years of age with regards to postoperative shoulder function 
or EQ-5D gains. Smoking was the only characteristic that significantly adversely 
influenced the EQ-5D at two years postoperatively (p = 0.005). A total of 87 
were promoters and five were passive, giving a mean NPS of 95 (87/92). The total 
mean cost per patient was £3646.94 and the mean EQ-5D difference at one year was 
0.2691, giving a mean ICER of £13 552.36/QALY. At two years, this decreased 
further to £5694.78/QALY. This was comparable for those aged below or above 65 
years of age (£5209.91 vs £5525.67). Smokers had an ICER that was four times 
more expensive.
CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair results in excellent patient 
satisfaction and cost-effectiveness, regardless of age. Cite this article: Bone

Care of the musculoskeletal system, including the muscles, joints, and bones, is 
important for a healthy life expectancy in today's aging society. The aim of 
this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to investigate the 
effect of consumption of milk-fat globule membrane (MFGM) and glucosamine on 
joint function and physical performance. Participants were healthy Japanese men 
and women, aged 60-74 y, with a history of mild knee or low back pain at rest. 
They were randomized to receive tablets containing MFGM 1.0 g+glucosamine 1.5 g 
or placebo tablets for 8 wk. We assessed passive range of motion, active range 
of motion (self-reported VAS score), JKOM and JLEQ, and physical performance. 
Data were available for analysis for 25 participants in the active treatment 
group and 28 in the placebo group. The active group showed significant 
improvements in passive range of motion at the knee and active range of motion 
at both the knee and low back. The active group also showed significant 
improvements in some physical performance, including obstacle walking speed and 
speed of ascending stairs. The findings of this study suggest that consumption 
of a combination of MFGM and glucosamine may improve joint function and physical 
performance.

Bioanalysis assays that reliably quantify biotherapeutics and biomarkers in 
biological samples play pivotal roles in drug discovery and development. Liquid 
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), owing to its superior 
specificity, faster method development and multiplex capability, has evolved as 
one of the most important platforms for bioanalysis of biotherapeutics, 
particularly new scaffolds such as half-life extension platforms for proteins 
and peptides, as well as antibody drug conjugates. Intact LC-MS analysis is 
orthogonal to bottom-up surrogate peptide approach by providing whole molecule 
quantitation and high-level sequence and structure information. Here we review 
the latest development in LC-MS bioanalysis of intact proteins and peptides by 
summarizing recent publications and discussing the important topics such as the 
comparison between top-down intact analysis and bottom-up surrogate peptide 
approach, as well as simultaneous quantitation and catabolite identification. 
Key bioanalytical issues around intact protein bioanalysis such as sensitivity, 
data processing strategies, specificity, sample preparation and LC condition are 
elaborated. For peptides, topics including quantitation of intact peptide vs. 
digested surrogate peptide, metabolites, sensitivity, LC condition, assay 
performance, internal standard and sample preparation are discussed.

In the current era of effective antiretroviral therapies (ARTs), human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection became a chronic disorder that requires 
long term follow-up. Among other medical issues, these patients may develop 
endocrine problems, specific to HIV infection and its treatment. The purpose of 
this review is to give an overview of common endocrine complications associated 
with HIV infection, and to propose diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. HIV 
can affect the endocrine system at several levels. Adrenal and gonadal 
dysfunction, osteoporosis with increased fracture risk, dyslipidemia with 
increased cardiovascular risk, are some of the endocrine disorders prevalent in 
HIV-infected patients that may negatively influence quality of life, and 
increase morbidity and mortality. While ARTs have dramatically increased life 
expectancy in the HIV-infected population, they are not devoid of adverse 
effects, including endocrine dysfunction. Physicians caring for HIV-infected 
patients should be knowledgeable and exercise a high index of suspicion for the 
diagnosis of endocrine abnormalities, and in particular be aware of those that 
can be life threatening. Endocrine evaluation should follow the same strategies 
as in the general population, including prevention, early detection, and 
treatment.

Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the associations between 
self-reported ability to afford dental care and quality of life in adults aged 
45 years and older. Method: We used publicly available cross-sectional data from 
the 2008 National Health Interview Survey and its oral health supplement for 
11,760 adults aged 45+ years. The increased probabilities of reporting dental 
problems attributable to an inability to afford dental care were estimated from 
multivariate models and combined with respective dental problem disability 
weights from the Global Burden of Disease to measure loss in quality of life. 
Results: Prevalence of reported inability to afford dental care, severe tooth 
loss, severe periodontitis, and untreated caries were 11.9%, 8.5%, 14.3%, and 
37.9%, respectively. Inability to afford dental care was associated with an 
increase of 0.017 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per person per year 
under base case and 0.020 DALYs under generous assumptions. Conclusion: Making 
dental care affordable could improve adult's (age 45 and above) quality of life 
at a reasonable cost.

The increase of both life expectancy of the Western industrialized population 
and cancer incidence with aging is expected to result in a rapid expansion of 
the elderly cancer population, including patients with epithelial ovarian cancer 
(EOC). Although the survival of patients with EOC has generally improved over 
the past three decades, this progress has yet to provide benefits for elderly 
patients. Compared with young age, advanced age has been reported as an adverse 
prognostic factor influencing EOC. However, contradicting results have been 
obtained, and the mechanisms underlying this observation are poorly defined. Few 
papers have been published on the underlying biological mechanisms that might 
explain this prognosis trend. We provide an extensive review of mechanisms that 
have been linked to EOC prognosis and/or aging in the published literature and 
might underlie this relationship in humans.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. It 
consists of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, a ventricular septal 
defect, abnormally located aorta and right ventricular hypertrophy. It usually 
occurs as an isolated anomaly with a normally placed heart and abdominal 
viscera. We present a case of a 19 years old female who presented with a 
prolonged history of shortness of breath (SOB) and cyanosis. After undergoing 
echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography angiogram (CTA), she was 
diagnosed to be a case of Tetrology of Fallot (TOF) in association with situs 
inversus with levocardia also termed 'isolated levocardia'. The patient 
underwent surgical correction and she was asymptomatic with no residual cardiac 
defects on follow up after 6 months. Isolated levocardia is a rare condition 
that is usually associated with severe cardiac defects and a low life expectancy 
in untreated patients. It is unusual for it to be diagnosed in adults as in our 
case.

Image-guided Percutaneous Polymethylmethacrylate-augmented Spondylodesis for 
Painful Metastasis in the Veteran Population.

Author information:

The treatment of painful spinal metastases in patients with limited 
life-expectancy, significant perioperative risks, and poor bone quality poses a 
surgical challenge. Recent advances in minimal-access spine surgery allow for 
the surgical treatment of patients previously considered not to be operative 
candidates. The addition of fenestrated screws for cement augmentation to 
existing image-guided percutaneous pedicle screw fixation can enhance 
efficiency, decrease risk of hardware complications, and improve back pain in 
this patient population. The patient is a 70-year-old man with severe axial back 
pain due to metastatic prostate cancer and L5 pathologic fractures not amenable 
to kyphoplasty. In the setting of a 6-12-month life-expectancy, the primary goal 
of surgery was relief of back pain associated with instability with minimal 
operative morbidity and post-operative recovery time. This was achieved with an 
internal fixation construct including percutaneously placed cement-augmented 
fenestrated pedicle screws at L4 and S1. The patient was discharged to home on 
post-operative day 1 with substantial improvement of his low back pain. 
Image-guided, percutaneous placement of fenestrated, cement-augmented pedicle 
screws is an emerging treatment for back pain associated with metastasis. 
Fenestrated screws allow for integrated cement augmentation. The minimal 
associated blood loss and recovery time make this approach an option even for 
patients with limited life-expectancy. This is the first report of utilization 
of this technique for the veteran population.

OBJECTIVE: People with serious mental illness have dramatically reduced life 
expectancy that is largely attributed to elevated rates of chronic medical 
conditions. Several group interventions have been developed and implemented in 
recent years to improve health and wellness among people with mental health 
conditions. Unfortunately, attendance in these interventions is often low, and 
there is limited understanding of factors that influence patient engagement in 
this treatment modality.
METHOD: Participants (N = 242) were enrolled in 1 of 2 group-based health and 
wellness treatment programs. Using descriptive statistics and regression, we 
assessed treatment attendance and a range of potential predictors of attendance.
RESULTS: We found lower attendance among people who were younger, people with 
more medical conditions, and people with more emergency room visits in the 6 
months prior to the beginning of treatment. Younger age was a particularly 
strong predictor of low attendance and was the only variable significantly 
associated with attending zero treatment sessions.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These results highlight the need for 
strategies to improve engagement of patients with poorer objective indicators of 
medical health and patients with younger age. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020

OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency of hyponatremia and potentially related 
symptoms in clinical trials of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in adults with 
focal- (partial-) onset seizures.
METHODS: This post hoc, exploratory analysis included data from three controlled 
phase 3 trials of adjunctive ESL (400-1200 mg once daily), two phase 3 trials of 
ESL monotherapy (1200-1600 mg once daily), and their open-label extension 
studies. Exploratory endpoints included clinical laboratory measurements of 
serum sodium concentrations ([Na+ ]), incidences of hyponatremia-related 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and incidences of TEAEs that are 
potential symptoms of hyponatremia.
RESULTS: The controlled trials of adjunctive ESL and ESL monotherapy included 
1447 (placebo, n = 426; ESL, n = 1021) and 365 (ESL, n = 365) patients, 
respectively; 639 and 274 patients continued onto uncontrolled, open-label 
extensions. In the controlled and uncontrolled trials ≤3.3% of patients taking 
ESL had a minimum postdose [Na+ ] measurement ≤125 mEq/L, <9% had a >10 mEq/L 
decrease in [Na+ ] from baseline, <6% had a hyponatremia-related TEAE, and <2% 
discontinued the controlled trials due to a hyponatremia-related TEAE. 
Hyponatremia appeared to be more frequent in the monotherapy (vs adjunctive 
therapy) trials; in the controlled trials of adjunctive ESL and ESL monotherapy, 
incidence generally increased with increasing ESL dose. The majority of patients 
with an investigator-reported TEAE of "hyponatremia" or "blood sodium decreased" 
did not have a corresponding laboratory [Na+ ] measurement ≤125 mEq/L. Some 
symptoms potentially related to hyponatremia (including nausea and vomiting) 
were more frequent in patients with a minimum postdose [Na+ ] measurement ≤125 
mEq/L.
SIGNIFICANCE: Reductions in serum sodium concentrations and hyponatremia-related 
TEAEs occurred in a small number of patients taking ESL. Suspected hyponatremia 
should be confirmed and monitored via [Na+ ] measurements.

AIM: Type IV Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a connective tissue disorder 
affecting approximately 1 per 100,000-200,000 people. Life expectancy is reduced 
secondary to spontaneous vascular rupture or colonic perforation. Surgery 
carries significant morbidity and mortality. While strategies to manage colonic 
perforation include primary repair with or without a defunctioning stoma, 
Hartmann's procedure, total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy and 
ileorectal anastomosis, evidence is contradictory and has not previously been 
evaluated in order to form a treatment strategy. We aim to review the published 
literature and identify outcome data relating to operative management of colonic 
perforation in type IV EDS.
METHODS: Pubmed, EM-BASE, Cochrane library and Google Scholar were searched with 
the following details: Ehlers Danlos Syndrome AND colonic surgery. The main 
outcome measure was re-perforation rates following colonic surgery on patients 
with type IV EDS. If the nature of surgery and follow up were reported, data 
were recorded in a SPSS database according to PRISMA guidelines.
RESULTS: One hundred and nine operations have been described in 51 patients in 
44 case series. There were 26 visceral re-perforations, 2 affecting the small 
intestine and 24 colonic. Survival analysis favoured total abdominal colectomy 
compared with operations where the colon was left in situ.
CONCLUSIONS: Total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy or ileorectal 
anastomosis are the safest strategies after colonic perforation in type IV EDS. 
Anastomotic leak rates are high. End colostomy is high risk for colonic 
re-perforation and anastomotic leak rates are extremely high. Restoration of 
colonic continuity should be avoided.

Traffic noise is nearly ubiquitous and thus can affect the health of many 
people. Using the German noise mapping data according to the Directive 
2002/49/EC of 2017 and exposure-response functions for ischemic heart disease, 
noise annoyance and sleep disturbance assessed by the World Health 
Organization's Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region the burden 
of disease due to traffic noise is quantified. The burden of disease is 
expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and its components. The 
highest burden was found for road traffic noise, with 75,896 DALYs when only 
considering moderate evidence. When including all available evidence, 176,888 
DALYs can be attributable to road traffic noise. The burden due to aircraft and 
railway noise is lower because fewer people are exposed. Comparing the burden by 
health outcomes, the biggest share is due to ischemic heart disease (90%) in 
regard to aircraft noise, however, the lowest evidence was expressed for the 
association between traffic noise and ischemic heart disease. Therefore, the 
results should be interpreted with caution. Using alternative input parameters 
(e.g., exposure data) can lead to a much higher burden. Nevertheless, 
environmental noise is an important risk factor which leads to considerable loss 
of healthy life years.

Avocado is a highly potential functional fruit with significant health benefits 
which has high demand for consumption with a preferable taste. The fruit is one 
of the oil sources that still needs further examination on its probable kinetic 
behavior and oxidative stability as well as some characteristic behavior to 
commercialize and increase the market demand as functional oil. Hence, this 
study was motivated primarily for obtaining the Arrhenius kinetic information 
about avocado oil to evaluate the oxidative stability and provide predictive 
information about the shelf life by using the Rancimat method which is an 
accelerated shelf life test. Specifically, this research paper presents the 
study of the physical, physicochemical, chemical, and oxidative stability tests 
with the shelf life expectancy and kinetic property of avocado oil. According to 
the analyses, avocado oil has 210 days of predicted shelf life at 25 °C. This 
gives it a greater chance to be considered a good alternative to other oils as 
well as its antioxidant and phenolic content. According to the findings 
presented in this study, avocado oil has a very similar profile to olive oil and 
can be used as an alternative functional oil source.

Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most frequent presentations to optometrists 
with over 16 million US adults (6.8% of adult population) diagnosed as having 
this disorder. The majority of associated marketed products offer relief from 
symptomatology but do not address aetiology. DED harbours many distinguishing 
features of a chronic inflammatory disorder. The recent explosion in human 
microbiome research has sparked interest in the ocular microbiome and its role 
in the preservation and extension of ocular surface health and in the 
contribution of the gut microbiome to chronic systemic inflammation and 
associated "Western life-style" diseases. With a significant lack of success for 
many patients using currently available DED treatments, in this era of the 
microbiome, we are interested in exploring potential novel therapies that aim to 
reconstitute healthy bacterial communities both locally and distally (in the 
gut) as a treatment for DED. Although this direction of investigation is in its 
infancy, burgeoning interest makes such a review timely. This paper considers a 
number of studies into the use functional foods and associated products to 
ameliorate dry eye.

Aims: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole compared with the 
standard of care, voriconazole, for the treatment of patients with invasive 
fungal infection disease when differential diagnosis of the causative pathogen 
has not yet been achieved at treatment initiation.Materials and methods: The 
economic model was developed from the perspective of the UK National Health 
Service (NHS) and used a decision-tree approach to reflect real-world treatment 
of patients with invasive fungal infection (IFI) prior to differential pathogen 
diagnosis. It was assumed that 7.8% of patients with IFI prior to differential 
pathogen diagnosis at treatment initiation actually had mucormycosis, and 
confirmation of pathogen identification was achieved for 50% of all patients 
during treatment. To extrapolate to a lifetime horizon, the model considered 
expected survival based on the patients' underlying condition. The model 
estimated the incremental costs (costs of drugs, laboratory analysis, 
hospitalization, and management of adverse events) and clinical outcomes 
(life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) of first-line 
treatment with isavuconazole compared with voriconazole. The robustness of the 
results was assessed by conducting deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.Results: Isavuconazole delivered 0.48 more LYs and 0.39 more QALYs per 
patient at an incremental cost of £3,228, compared with voriconazole in the 
treatment of patients with IFI prior to differential pathogen diagnosis. This 
equates to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £8,242 per 
additional QALY gained and £6,759 per LY gained. These results were driven by a 
lack of efficacy of voriconazole in mucormycosis. Results were most sensitive to 
the mortality of IA patients and treatment durations.Conclusions: At a 
willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of £30,000 per additional QALY, the use of 
isavuconazole for the treatment of patients with IFI prior to differential 
pathogen diagnosis in the UK can be considered a cost-effective allocation of 
healthcare resources compared with voriconazole.

Objectives: Theoretically, willingness-to-pay (WTP) for quality-adjusted life 
years (QALY) can vary depending on social and personal preferences and on 
ex-ante and ex-post settings. However, empirical investigations into the 
theoretical differences are lacking. In Japan, setting the threshold has been 
controversial since a pilot project to implement health technology assessments 
(HTA) launched in 2016. The study aim is to estimate WTP values for one 
additional QALY from different perspectives, health statuses, and contexts to 
confirm the difficulty in setting a uniform price threshold using WTP. Methods: 
More than 1,000 respondents representing a cross-section of the Japanese 
population answered each of nine questionnaire decks in an online panel. WTP 
values were estimated on three different perspectives (personal, social, and 
socially inclusive) and on two contexts (ex-ante and ex-post). This study 
primarily used the non-parametric spike model based on double-bounded 
dichotomous choice (DBDC) settings to obtain the conditional WTP values. 
Results: WTP per QALY was higher in the severe health status than in the 
moderate health status from all perspectives. Respondents from the socially 
inclusive perspective estimated the highest WTP value for a new drug. 
Respondents were also asked about life-threatening diseases in ex-post and 
ex-ante. The WTP value in ex-ante was higher than in ex-post, and demographic 
factors affecting the WTP were different in both situations. The various WTP 
values were obtained from these surveys. Limitations: The analysis was based on 
data collected from an internet panel, which could be biased. There is also a 
risk that respondents answered the questionnaire differently if asked in 
everyday situations. Conclusion: Use of a uniform price threshold may not be 
appropriate in policy settings, because it may not reflect diverse preferences 
based on different situations, such as disease type and severity. Setting a 
price threshold as Japan institutes an HTA system requires further research.

The objective of this systematic review was to survey the current scientific 
knowledge regarding the state of somatic health among situation of the 
Indigenous Sami people in Norway, Finland, Sweden and the Kola Peninsula in 
Russia; and assess the quality of the identified studies. A systematic search in 
the databases Pubmed, EBSCOhost (AMED, Medline, Cinahl) and Svemed was conducted 
from January 2000, through December 2017. This systematic search identified 399 
articles. After screening abstracts, 93 articles were reviewed in full text, 32 
of which met the inclusion criteria. The scientific quality of the evidence was 
rated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Based on the studies with 
moderate to high scientific quality, there is evidence for stating that the 
majority of the Sami included in this review experience good health. Mortality 
and life expectancy are similar, with only minor differences, to those of a 
non-Sami population. The cancer risk rate among Sami was lower than that of the 
general population of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Self-reported myocardial 
infarction prevalence was similar between Sami and non-Sami, but Angina pectoris 
was more prevalent among Sami. In Sweden, cardiovascular disease rates were 
similar between Sami and non-Sami. Musculoskeletal pain symptoms are common 
among the Sami population, as are obesity and overweight. To conclude, there are 
knowledge gaps in regard to the somatic health situation of the Indigenous Sami 
in the circumpolar area, especially in Russia, Finland and Sweden; as current 
knowledge is mainly based on publications from the SAMINOR study in Norway. No 
study obtained the highest quality score, suggesting a need to implement 
longitudinal prospective studies.

BACKGROUND: One challenge in caring for cancer patients with incurable disease 
is the adequate identification of those in need for specialized palliative care 
(SPC). The study's aim was to validate an easy to use phenomenological screening 
tool.
METHODS: The German tool is based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) Palliative Care guidelines and contains ten items in five domains that 
focus e.g. on diagnosis, functional status, complications, comorbidities, and 
palliative care relevant problems such as symptom management, distress, and 
support of family and team members. Sum score ranges from 0 to 14 (no need to 
great need). Assessment to identify SPC needs was done in university hospital 
wards between 1 and 08/2017 by health care professionals on admission of the 
patient if the disease was incurable and expected prognosis < 12 months. The 
Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS, staff version), an outcome assessment 
instrument for palliative care that consists of ten items, served as external 
criterion; in sub samples inter-rater/test-retest were performed.
RESULTS: Data from 208 patients with incurable disease and life expectancy 
< 12 months (54.8% female; average age 63.5 years, range 21-96) were assessed 
using the tool. The tool has good convergent validity; the correlation between 
the sum scores of IPOS and our tool showed a significant and substantial effect. 
The sum score was independent of the patient's age, gender and primary 
diagnosis. Patients who already were in contact with SPC had significantly 
higher screening scores than patients without. With a cut point of  ≥ 5, 80.8% 
of the screened patients were in need for SPC. Cronbach's alpha was α = .600. 
Rater agreement (inter-rater, test-retest) varied between single items. 
Correlation coefficients showed significant substantial effects.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first validation of a screening procedure in German 
language identifying SPC needs of adult patients with advanced cancer and the 
first using filter questions as a pre-screening. Proxy assessment of SPC needs 
by physicians in cancer care settings is feasible and the suggested tool 
presents a valid instrument to trigger a PC consultation.

BACKGROUND: Economic evaluations provide policy makers with information to 
facilitate efficient resource allocation. To date, the quality and scope of 
economic evaluations in the field of child oral health has not been evaluated. 
Furthermore, whilst the involvement of children in research has been actively 
encouraged in recent years, the success of this movement in dental health 
economics has not yet been explored. This review aimed to determine the quality 
and scope of published economic evaluations applied to children's oral health 
and to consider the extent of children's involvement.
METHODS: The following databases were searched: CINAHL, Cochrane Library, 
Econlit, EThOS, MEDLINE, NHS EED, OpenGrey, Scopus, Web of Science. Full 
economic evaluations, relating to any aspect of child oral health, published 
after 1997 were included and appraised against the Drummond checklist and the 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards by a team of four 
calibrated reviewers. Data were also extracted regarding children's involvement 
and the outcome measures used.
RESULTS: Two thousand seven hundred fifteen studies were identified, of which 46 
met the inclusion criteria. The majority (n = 38, 82%) were cost-effectiveness 
studies, with most focusing on the prevention or management of dental caries 
(n = 42, 91%). One study quantified outcomes in Quality Adjusted Life Years 
(QALYs), and one study utilised a child-reported outcome measure. The mean 
percentage of applicable Drummond checklist criteria met by the studies in this 
review was 48% (median = 50%, range = 0-100%) with key methodological weaknesses 
noted in relation to discounting of costs and outcomes. The mean percentage of 
applicable CHEERS criteria met by each study was 77% (median = 83%, 
range = 33-100%), with limited reporting of conflicts of interest. Children's 
engagement was largely overlooked.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of high-quality economic evaluations in the 
field of child oral health. This deficiency could be addressed through the 
endorsement of standardised economic evaluation guidelines by dental journals. 
The development of a child-centred utility measure for use in paediatric oral 
health would enable researchers to quantify outcomes in terms of quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) whilst promoting child-centred research.
