BACKGROUND: Xeroderma pigmentosum is an extremely serious genetic disorder 
defined by sensitivity to sunlight, resulting in sunburn and pigment changes. If 
patients are not completely protected from ultraviolet radiation, xeroderma 
pigmentosum is characterized by a greatly increased risk of sunlight-induced 
cutaneous neoplasms. There is no standard therapy for skin cancer of xeroderma 
pigmentosum. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors were reported to increase 
response rates and improve outcomes and life expectancy in patients with various 
cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma in xeroderma pigmentosum. In this 
paper, we report on a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum from a consanguineous 
family with recurrent facial chemotherapy-resistant squamous cell carcinoma 
lesions treated successfully with an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 
monoclonal antibody in both relapses.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-year-old Turkish male was referred to our oncology 
department for recurring squamous cell carcinoma after local excision of the 
tumor over his nose. The lesion was a rapidly growing lesion, measuring 8 × 4 cm 
in size. Physical examination revealed that he also had hemorrhagic crusted 
plaques and nodules over both eyelids and upper lip, with multiple hypo- and 
hyperpigmented punctate lesions all over his body. After two more cycles of 
chemotherapy, progressive disease was noted, and a new lesion on the right 
eyelid caused blurred vision. Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody 
treatment was planned with concomitant radiotherapy. He received nivolumab every 
3 weeks for 4 months, improving his vision. No new lesions or active complaints 
have been observed in the current situation, and complete remission has been 
achieved. On the last admission, the patient was clinically diagnosed with 
xeroderma pigmentosum. Owing to the condition's genetic heterogeneity, 
whole-exome sequencing was performed with Ion Proton next-generation sequencing 
platform, and the c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation of the XPC gene was 
detected in the homozygous state.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical report emphasizes the importance of clinical awareness 
and crucial early diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum and presents a novel 
causative homozygous c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation. Our case proves that 
next-generation sequencing is an effective method for the rapid diagnosis and 
determination of xeroderma pigmentosum genetic etiology.

Phosphate-based drinking water softeners are commonly used to prevent scale 
formation in drinking water distribution infrastructure. The main reason for 
drinking water softening is primarily economic (protection of pipes and 
extension of equipment life), while the health aspect of such treatment is 
usually neglected. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of 
phosphate-based drinking water softeners on growth stimulation of Legionella 
pneumophila. Bacterial growth was observed at two different phosphate 
concentrations. On average, an increase in growth of 1.19-1.28 log CFU/mL was 
observed in selected samples with added phosphates compared with the control. 
The results of the in vitro experiment confirmed that the added phosphates 
stimulate the growth of L. pneumophila; growth stimulation could therefore be 
expected in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) when phosphates are used 
as well. The availability of phosphorus in DWDS may be a crucial limiting factor 
for biofouling control. Consequently, phosphate-based chemicals for drinking 
water should be avoided or used with prudence, especially in drinking water with 
high concentrations of other nutrients.

OBJECTIVE: Involuntary admission to psychiatric inpatient care can protect both 
patients with severe mental illnesses and individuals around them. This study 
analyzed annual healthcare costs per person for involuntary psychiatric 
admission and examined categories of mental disorders and other factors 
associated with mortality.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected 1 million randomly sampled 
beneficiaries from the National Health Insurance Database for 2002-2013. It 
identified and matched 181 patients with involuntary psychiatric admissions 
(research group) with 724 patients with voluntary psychiatric admissions 
(control group) through 1:4 propensity-score matching for sex, age, 
comorbidities, mental disorder category, and index year of diagnosis.
RESULTS: Mean life expectancy of patients with involuntary psychiatric 
admissions was 33.13 years less than the general population. Average annual 
healthcare costs per person for involuntary psychiatric admissions were 3.94 
times higher compared with voluntary admissions. The general linear model 
demonstrated that average annual medical costs per person per compulsory 
hospitalization were 5.8 times that of voluntary hospitalization. Survival 
analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model found no significant 
association between type of psychiatric admission (involuntary or voluntary) and 
death.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed no significant difference in mortality between 
involuntary and voluntary psychiatric admissions, indicating involuntary 
treatment's effectiveness.

Monosodium iodoacetate-induced subchondral bone microstructure and inflammatory 
changes in an animal model of osteoarthritis.

The monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis (OA) may lead to 
cartilage degeneration and histopathological lesions. However, the correlation 
between inflammatory reaction and subchondral bone remodeling in a rodent 
osteoarthritic model is ambiguous. In this study, intra-articular injection of 
MIA was performed in 36 four-week-old specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats to 
induce OA. After 4 weeks of intervention, changes in intrinsic structural 
properties of the subchondral bones were measured, and the histological 
evaluation, as well as biochemical analysis, was conducted. We found that 
intra-articular injection of MIA increased chondrocyte apoptosis and promoted 
cartilage matrix degradation, such as cartilage surface defects and shallow or 
disappearing staining. MIA also induced inflammation, improved the expression of 
IL-1β, TNF-α, and matrix metalloproteinase, and decreased the expression of 
cartilage-specific proteins with the extension of modeling time. Meanwhile, the 
MIA also significantly accelerated the subchondral bone remodeling, as shown by 
the decreased subchondral bone density, thinning of trabeculae, disordered 
cartilage structure, and morphology. In conclusion, we have shown that 
MIA-induced rodent osteoarthritic model would cause decreased subchondral bone 
density, sparse trabecular bone, and other manifestations of osteoporosis 
accompanied by an inflammatory response, which would worsen with the progression 
of modeling time. Our results suggest that different phases of MIA-induced OA 
are associated with the changes in subchondral bone microstructure and the 
progression of local inflammation.

Contribution of the Technical Efficiency of Public Health Programs to National 
Trends and Regional Disparities in Unintentional Childhood Injury in Japan.

To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, strengthening investments in 
health service inputs has been widely emphasized, but less attention has been 
paid to tackling variation in the technical efficiency of services. In this 
study, we estimated the technical efficiency of local public health programs for 
the prevention of unintentional childhood injury and explored its contribution 
to national trend changes and regional health disparities in Japan. Efficiency 
scores were estimated based on the Cobb-Douglas and translog production 
functions using a true fixed effects model in a stochastic frontier analysis to 
account for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity across prefectures. Using 
public data sources, we compiled panel data from 2001 to 2017 for all 47 
prefectures in Japan. We treated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as the 
output, coverage rates of public health programs as inputs, and caregivers' 
capacity and environmental factors as constraints. To investigate the 
contribution of efficiency to trend changes and disparities in output, we 
calculated the predicted DALYs with several measures of inefficiency scores 
(2001 average, yearly average, and prefecture-year-specific estimates). In the 
translog model, mean efficiency increased from 0.62 in 2001 to 0.85 in 2017. The 
efficiency gaps among prefectures narrowed until 2007 and then remained constant 
until 2017. Holding inefficiency score constant, inputs and constraints 
contributed to improvements in average DALYs and widened regional gaps. Improved 
efficiency over the years further contributed to improvements in average DALYs. 
Efficiency improvement in low-output regions and stagnated improvement in 
high-output regions offset the trend of widening regional health disparities. 
Similar results were obtained with the Cobb-Douglas model. Our results 
demonstrated that assessing the inputs, constraints, output, and technical 
efficiency of public health programs could provide policy leverage relevant to 
region-specific conditions and performance to achieve health promotion and 
equity.

Objectives: Energy transition scenarios are prospective outlooks describing 
combinations of changes in socio-economic systems that are compatible with 
climate targets. These changes could have important health co-benefits. We aimed 
to quantify the health benefits of physical activity caused by active 
transportation on all-cause mortality in the French negaWatt scenario over the 
2021-2050 period. Methods; Relying on a health impact assessment framework, we 
quantified the health benefits of increased walking, cycling and E-biking 
projected in the negaWatt scenario. The negaWatt scenario assumes increases of 
walking and cycling volumes of +11% and +612%, respectively, over the study 
period. Results: As compared to a scenario with no increase in volume of active 
travel, we quantified that the negaWatt scenario would prevent 9,797 annual 
premature deaths in 2045 and translate into a 3-month increase in life 
expectancy in the general population. These health gains would generate €34 
billion of economic benefits from 2045 onwards. Conclusion: Increased physical 
activity implied in the negaWatt transition scenario would generate substantial 
public health benefits, which are comparable to the gain expected by large scale 
health prevention interventions.

We present a case demonstrating that older age does not exclude long-term 
survival with glioblastoma. This is a malignant neoplasm with a median life 
expectancy of 14 months in patients treated with radical intent. Survival is 
dependent on several independent and interacting prognostic factors of which 
advancing age is a negative factor. We present a septuagenarian with a 3.5-year 
survival following aggressive management. The potential to improve glioblastoma 
survival in an elderly population by examination of additional prognostic 
factors and identifying biomarkers warrants further research.

Regular physical exercise can decrease the risk for obesity, diabetes, and 
cardiovascular disease, increase life expectancy, and promote psychological 
health and neurocognitive functioning. Cross-sectional studies show that 
cardiorespiratory fitness level (VO2 max) is associated with enhanced brain 
health, including improved mood state and heightened cognitive performance. 
Interventional studies are consistent with these cross-sectional studies, but 
most have focused on low-fit populations. Few such studies have asked if 
increasing levels of physical activity in moderately fit people can 
significantly enhance mood, motivation, and cognition. Therefore, the current 
study investigated the effects of increasing aerobic exercise in moderately fit 
individuals on psychological state and cognitive performance. We randomly 
assigned moderately fit healthy adults, 25-59 years of age, who were engaged in 
one or two aerobic exercise sessions per week to either maintain their exercise 
regimen (n = 41) or increase their exercise regimen (i.e., 4-7 aerobic workouts 
per week; n = 39) for a duration of 3 months. Both before and after the 
intervention, we assessed aerobic capacity using a modified cardiorespiratory 
fitness test, and hippocampal functioning via various neuropsychological 
assessments including a spatial navigation task and the Mnemonic Similarity Task 
as well as self-reported measures including the Positive and Negative Affect 
Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Perceived Stress 
Scale, Rumination Scale, Eating Disorders Examination, Eating Attitudes Test, 
Body Attitudes Test, and Behavioral Regulation of Exercise Questionnaire. 
Consistent with our initial working hypotheses, we found that increasing 
exercise significantly decreased measures of negative affect, including fear, 
sadness, guilt, and hostility, as well as improved body image. Further, we found 
that the total number of workouts was significantly associated with improved 
spatial navigation abilities and body image as well as reduced anxiety, general 
negative affect, fear, sadness, hostility, rumination, and disordered eating. In 
addition, increases in fitness levels were significantly associated with 
improved episodic memory and exercise motivation as well as decreased stress and 
disordered eating. Our findings are some of the first to indicate that in 
middle-aged moderately-fit adults, continuing to increase exercise levels in an 
already ongoing fitness regimen is associated with additional benefits for both 
psychological and cognitive health.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the economically justifiable price (EJP) of cenobamate 
to become a cost-effective alternative compared with third-generation 
anti-seizure medications in the treatment of focal-onset seizures (FOS) in adult 
patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) in Spain.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis compared cenobamate with brivaracetam, 
perampanel, eslicarbazepine acetate, and lacosamide. Markov model simulation of 
treatment pathway over a 60-year time horizon is presented. We determined the 
effectiveness and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of health status and 
disutilities associated with treatment-related adverse events. Acquisition costs 
and use of medical resources were obtained from published literature and expert 
opinion. Base-case of cenobamate's EJP calculated applying a willingness-to-pay 
(WTP) threshold of €21,000/QALY. Analyses were performed at different 
thresholds, including dominant price scenario. Result robustness was assessed 
through sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Base-case shows that cenobamate's daily EJP of €7.30 is cost-effective 
for a threshold of €21,000/QALY. At a daily price of €5.45, cenobamate becomes 
dominant over all treatment alternatives producing cost-savings for the national 
health system (NHS). Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of base-case 
findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with cenobamate produces incremental clinical benefit 
over third-generation ASMs, and at the base-case, EJP could represent a 
cost-effective option for the adjunctive treatment of FOS in adult patients with 
DRE in Spain.

As life expectancy increases, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasingly 
associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. Cognitive impairment can be a 
complication of CVD, develop at the same time or earlier than CVD. Often, the 
preclinical period of neurodegenerative diseases accompanied by cognitive 
impairment lasts for decades and their relationship with CVD is not fully 
understood. Studies have to take into account a large number of factors that are 
often interconnected with each other, so the role and mechanisms of action of 
each of them in the long term is very difficult to prove. The combination of CVD 
and cognitive impairment requires special approaches to patient management.

BACKGROUND: Nursing home (NH) residents seek care at dental offices, yet many of 
them are at the end of life. The uncertain life expectancy further complicates 
the care of NH residents. This study aimed to develop and validate a Nursing 
Home Mortality Index (NHMI) to identify NH residents in the last year of life.
METHODS: Logistic modeling was used to develop predictive models for death 
within 1 year after initial appointment by utilizing the new patient examination 
data and mortality data of 903 Minnesota NH residents. The final model was 
selected based on areas under the curve (AUC) and then validated using data from 
586 Iowa NH residents. Based on the final model, the NHMI was developed with the 
estimated 1-year mortality for the low, medium and high risk group.
RESULTS: One-year mortalities were 21% and 26% in the development and validation 
cohorts, respectively. Predictors included age, gender, communication capacity, 
physical mobility, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, 
cancer, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal disease and liver disease. AUCs 
for the development and validation models were 0.73 and 0.68, respectively. For 
the validation cohort, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.79 and 0.53, 
respectively. The estimated 1-year mortality risks for three risk groups were 
0%-10%, 11%-19%, and ≥20%, respectively CONCLUSION: The high mortality rate of 
NH residents following a dental exam highlighted a need to incorporate patients' 
prognoses in treatment planning along with normative needs and patients' 
preferences. The NHMI provides a practical way to guide treatment decisions for 
end-of-life NH residents.

BACKGROUND: Torus (buckle) fractures of the wrist are the most common fractures 
in children involving the distal radius and/or ulna. It is unclear if children 
require rigid immobilisation and follow-up or would recover equally as well by 
being discharged without any immobilisation or a bandage. Given the large number 
of these injuries, identifying the optimal treatment strategy could have 
important effects on the child, the number of days of school absence and NHS 
costs.
OBJECTIVES: To establish whether or not treating children with a distal radius 
torus fracture with the offer of a soft bandage and immediate discharge (i.e. 
offer of a bandage) provides the same recovery, in terms of pain, function, 
complications, acceptability, school absence and resource use, as treatment with 
rigid immobilisation and follow-up as per usual practice (i.e. rigid 
immobilisation).
DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled equivalence trial.
SETTING: Twenty-three UK emergency departments.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 965 children (aged 4-15 years) with a distal radius 
torus fracture were randomised from January 2019 to July 2020 using a secure, 
centralised, online-encrypted randomisation service. Exclusion criteria included 
presentation > 36 hours after injury, multiple injuries and an inability to 
complete follow-up.
INTERVENTIONS: A bandage was offered to 489 participants and applied to 458, and 
rigid immobilisation was carried out in 476 participants. Participants and 
clinicians were not blinded to the treatment allocation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The pain at 3 days post randomisation was measured using 
the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes were the 
patient-reported outcomes measurement system upper extremity limb score for 
children, health-related quality of life, complications, school absence, 
analgesia use and resource use collected up to 6 weeks post randomisation.
RESULTS: A total of 94% of participants provided primary outcome data. At 3 
days, the primary outcome of pain was equivalent in both groups. With reference 
to the prespecified equivalence margin of 1.0, the adjusted difference in the 
intention-to-treat population was -0.10 (95% confidence interval -0.37 to 0.17) 
and the per-protocol population was -0.06 (95% confidence interval -0.34 to 
0.21). There was equivalence of pain in both age subgroups (i.e. 4-7 years and 
8-15 years). There was no difference in the rate of complications, with five 
complications (1.0%) in the offer of a bandage group and three complications 
(0.6%) in the rigid immobilisation group. There were no differences between 
treatment groups in functional recovery, quality of life or school absence at 
any point during the follow-up. Analgesia use was marginally higher at day 1 in 
the offer of a bandage group than it was in the rigid immobilisation group (83% 
vs. 78% of participants), but there was no difference at other time points. The 
offer of a bandage significantly reduced the cost of treatment and had a high 
probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000 
per quality-adjusted life-year.
LIMITATIONS: Families had a strong pre-existing preference for the rigid 
immobilisation treatment. Given this, and the inability to blind families to the 
treatment allocation, observer bias was a concern. However, there was clear 
evidence of equivalence.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings support the offer of a bandage in children with 
a distal radius torus fracture.
FUTURE WORK: A clinical decision tool to determine which children require 
radiography is an important next step to prevent overtreatment of minor wrist 
fractures. There is also a need to rationalise interventions for other common 
childhood injuries (e.g. 'toddler's fractures' of the tibia).
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN13955395 and UKCRN 
Portfolio 39678.

Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in

Plain Language Summary: BACKGROUND: Torus fractures (also called buckle 
fractures) of the wrist are the most common type of broken bone in children, 
affecting 60,000 children in the UK per year. They are the mildest form of 
broken bone, in which the bone crushes (or buckles). Despite these fractures 
being so common, there is no ‘standard treatment’. The traditional treatment is 
to use a plaster cast and arrange outpatient follow-up. Recent medical research 
has suggested that wearing a bandage, or even having no treatment, might result 
in similar healing. In this study, we looked into whether or not a bandage 
(which was optional to wear) and no further follow-up resulted in the same 
recovery as a hard splint and usual follow-up. A total of 965 children aged 4–15 
years from 23 emergency departments in the UK took part in the study. Children 
were evenly divided between the bandage and hard splint groups in a process 
called randomisation. Prior to the study, families told us that managing pain 
after injury was the most important issue to them. We asked children and their 
families to tell us about pain, recovery using the arm, quality of life, 
complications encountered and school absences. We also looked at the financial 
costs to families and the NHS.
WHAT DID THE TRIAL FIND? The two treatments resulted in the same outcomes. The 
majority of those offered a bandage chose to wear it immediately. There was no 
difference at all in the levels of pain between those treated with a hard splint 
and usual outpatient follow-up and those offered a bandage and discharge (i.e. 
no further follow up) from hospital the same day. Similarly, there was no 
difference in the recovery using the arm, quality of life, complications 
encountered or school absences. There was a very slight increase in pain killer 
use in the bandage group at day 1, but not at any other time point. Overall, the 
cost of the offer of a bandage was slightly lower for families and the NHS. In 
conclusion, the findings of this study support offering a bandage to be used at 
the discretion of families to treat children with a torus fracture of the wrist.

BACKGROUND: The difference in epidemiological characteristics of breast cancer 
(BC) across countries is valuable for BC management and prevention. The study 
evaluated the up-to-date burden, trends, and risk factors of BC in China, Japan 
and South Korea during 1990-2019 and predicted the BC burden until 2034.
METHODS: Data on incident cases, deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
and age-standardized rate (ASR) of BC were extracted from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2019. Trend analysis and prediction until 2034 were conducted by 
estimated annual percentage change and a Bayesian age-period-cohort model, 
respectively. Besides, the attributable burden to BC risk factors was also 
estimated.
RESULTS: In 2019, the number of BC incident cases, deaths and DALYs in China 
were 375,484, 96,306 and 2,957,453, respectively. The ASR of incidence 
increased, while that of death and DALYs decreased for Chinese females and 
Japanese and South Korean males during 1990-2019. High body-mass-index (BMI) was 
the largest contributor to Chinese female BC deaths and DALYs, while alcohol use 
was the greatest risk factor for Japanese and South Korean as well as Chinese 
males. The incident cases and deaths were expected to continue increase during 
2020-2034 (except for Japanese female incident cases).
CONCLUSIONS: China had the greatest burden of BC among the three countries. 
Incident cases and deaths of BC were projected to increase over the next 
15 years in China, particularly among Chinese males. Effective prevention and 
management strategies are urgently necessary for BC control in China.

BACKGROUND: Opioid substitution treatment (OST) populations are aging and have 
increased mortality and somatic morbidity compared to general populations 
internationally. While OST patients have poor self-rated physical health and 
unmet healthcare needs, documented healthcare utilization has been sparsely 
investigated. The aim of this study was to assess registered healthcare 
utilization for somatic conditions in a sample of Swedish OST patients, and 
compare healthcare utilization among OST patients with and without use of 
on-site primary healthcare (PHC).
METHODS: Patients in OST in Malmö, Sweden, were recruited for a survey study 
conducted in 2017-2018. Survey data were compared with comprehensive patient 
records from specialized and primary care during one year prior to study 
inclusion (total n = 190). All patient records were examined for healthcare 
utilization, source of healthcare (PHC, emergency care and secondary care), and 
documented diagnoses and symptoms. Factors associated with healthcare 
utilization were analyzed by using logistic regression analysis. Patients with 
and without on-site PHC were compared by using descriptive statistics and Chi-2 
test.
RESULTS: A total of 88% of the sample had been in direct or indirect contact 
with somatic healthcare during one year (PHC 66%; emergency care 28%; secondary 
care 67%). The most prevalent somatic diagnoses were infectious diseases (39%) 
and symptom diagnoses (37%). Respiratory, dermatological and musculoskeletal 
diagnoses, and trauma/intoxication were documented in 21-26% of the sample, 
respectively. PHC utilization was associated with older age and being born in 
Sweden. Among patients with on-site PHC (n = 25), the number utilizing secondary 
care was 84%, and certain diagnostic codes were more frequent in this group.
CONCLUSION: OST patients are seemingly underserved as regards their physical 
health. Since increased OST access decreases opioid overdose fatalities, the 
life expectancy among OST patients is likely to increase and thereby also 
increases the risk of age-related conditions. Thus, easily accessible physical 
healthcare is of great importance in this group. On-site PHC might be a way to 
establish healthcare contact with OST patients, especially for non-acute 
conditions, although further research is needed.

On springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola): a morphofunctional study of the jumping 
apparatus.

BACKGROUND: Springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola) are tiny organisms that lead a 
hidden life, mostly occuring deep in the soil and on leaf litter. They have a 
variety of interesting body morphology patterns, the most famous of which is the 
catapult-like structure that enables them to jump and flee from predators. This 
highly specialized jumping apparatus consists of a mobile furca, which when at 
rest fits into a trigger, "the retinaculum" on the ventral side of the abdomen. 
Despite the many studies that have attempted to investigate the jumping 
apparatus, the actual mechanisms involved in the jump, for example the way in 
which the furca is released by the retinaculum, how and where the mechanisms of 
spring and hydrostatic pressure originate, are still not properly understood. 
The morphology of the jumping apparatus of Orchesella cincta was investigated in 
detail using confocal laser scanning microscopy and MicroCT techniques for 3D 
reconstruction.
RESULTS: The morphology of O. cincta with both flexed and extended furca is 
analysed and described. The abdominal musculature involved in the jumping 
mechanism and relevant structures of the exoskeleton of retinaculum and furca 
are described in detail. With the data obtained in this study, hypotheses can be 
made about (1) where and how the spring and hydrostatic pressure mechanisms 
originate; (2) which muscles act on the extension and flexion of the furca; (3) 
which muscles act on the retinaculum and (4) how the retinaculum is released 
from the furca.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparative morphological study proved informative, and shows 
how springtail jumping involves mechanisms unique to this taxon. Hydrostatic 
pressure regulation possibly varies between animals with distinct segmentation, 
and those with fused segmentation. Interesting cuticular characters were 
revealed, such as basal plates and sclerites related to the construction of the 
spring mechanism. The present study establishes itself as a model option for 
future morphofunctional studies on springtail's jumping. Analysis of videos and 
images using a high speed camera will be useful for understanding how the jump 
develops through take-off, aerial and landing phases.

BACKGROUND: The development of orphan drugs (ODs) is challenging from both 
development and business perspectives because of their small patient 
populations. To overcome such business challenges, lifecycle management (LCM), 
which maximizes profits by increasing sales and extending product lifetimes, is 
important to overcome the business challenges arising from their small patient 
populations. To clarify the activities of the LCM of ODs, we investigated 
additional indications that contribute to market expansion and marketing 
exclusivity using the patent extension and re-examination system of ODs approved 
in Japan between 2004 and 2019.
RESULTS: The 203 ODs consisting of 173 active ingredients were approved in Japan 
between 2004 and 2019. Sixty-eight (39%) of the 173 active ingredients have 
additional indications, of which 57 have at least one non-OD indication. 
Three-fourths of the 203 ODs had patent rights, and most of them included 
substance or use claims. Although the re-examination period for most ODs was 
10 years after the approval, most patents had a longer duration than the 
re-examination period.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmaceutical companies were actively adding non-OD indications 
and were emphasizing the use of patent rights by registering extensions of 
substance or use patents for exclusive marketing periods. These results indicate 
that LCM through the addition of indications and registration of patent 
extensions is carried out as a strategy for many ODs in Japan, similar to the 
LCM of general non-ODs.

First principles of terrestrial life: exemplars for potential extra-terrestrial 
biology.

The search for life elsewhere in the universe represents not only a potential 
expansion of our knowledge regarding life, but also a clarification of the first 
principles applicable to terrestrial life, which thus restrict the very search 
for extra-terrestrial life. Although there are no exact figures for how many 
species have existed throughout Earth's total history, we can still make 
inferences about how the distribution of this life has proceeded through a bell 
curve. This graph shows the totality of life, from its origin to its end. The 
system enclosing life contains a number of first principles designated the walls 
of minimal complexity and adaptive possibility, the fence of adaptation, and 
right-skewed extension. In this discussion of life, a framework will be 
formulated that, based on the dynamic relationship between mesophiles and 
extremophiles, will be imposed on exoworlds in order to utilize the graph's 
predictive power to analyze how extra-terrestrial life could unfold. In this 
framework the evolutionary variation does not depend on the specific 
biochemistry involved. Once life is 'up and running,' the various biochemical 
systems that can constitute terrestrial and extra-terrestrial life will have 
secondary significance. The extremophilic tail represents a range expansion in 
which all habitat possibilities are tested and occupied. This tail moves to the 
right not because of the biochemistry constitutions of organisms, but because it 
can do nothing else. Thus, it can be predicted that graphs of terrestrial and 
extra-terrestrial life will be similar overall. A number of other predictions 
can be made; for example, for worlds in which the atmospheric disequilibrium is 
approaching equilibrium, it is predicted that life may still be present because 
the extremophilic range expansion is stretched increasingly farther to the 
right. Because life necessarily arises at a left wall of minimal complexity, it 
is predicted that any origin of cellular life will have a close structural 
resemblance to that of the first terrestrial life. Thus, in principle, life may 
have originated more than once on Earth, and still exist. It is also predicted 
that there may be an entire subset of life existing among other domains that we 
do not see because, in an abstract sense, we are inside the graph. If we view 
the graph in its entirety, this subset appears very much like a vast 
supra-domain of life.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease whose natural 
history leads to articular and extra-articular damage. Both cardiovascular risk 
and malignancy risk results higher in RA patients, compared to general 
population. Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) are oral targeted synthetic disease 
modifying antirheumatic drugs (tsDMARDs) that disrupt cytokine cascade and exert 
anti-inflammatory effects by interfering with signaling through the JAK-STAT 
intracellular pathways. A recent RCT comparing tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, 
tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily and anti-TNF in rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated 
an increased risk of MACE HR 1.33 and cancer HR 1.49 at a follow-up of 4 years. 
This has led the FDA to class warnings for tofacitinib, baricitinib and 
upadacitinib. Cumulative RCT data, RCT extension data demonstrated a safety 
profile for Jak inhibitors. Conflicting data results from real life registries; 
the different selectivity for JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2) probably 
determines differences in efficacy and safety profiles among the members of this 
group which should actually be evaluated. In order to better understand the 
cardiovascular and neoplastic risk linked to these class of drugs, we aim to 
provide a literature review on existing evidence of the safety of Jak-Inhibitors 
in rheumatoid arthritis.
