Although marked improvements have been observed in the life expectancy of 
patients with thalassaemia by regular blood transfusion and strict iron 
chelation therapies in recent years, these patients still have to deal with 
several complications, mainly cardiovascular. One of the life-threatening 
complications is the chronic hypercoagulable state and thromboembolic events 
which develop due to haemostatic alterations in patients with thalassaemia, 
although they are more frequently seen in those with thalassaemia intermedia. 
Many thromboembolic complications, mainly deep venous thrombosis and cerebral 
thrombosis, have been reported in thalassaemia. However, intracardiac thrombosis 
is rarely seen. In this manuscript, we presented a case that underwent 
splenectomy 6 years ago but not regularly attended the control visits and 
presented to our clinic with gradually increasing exercise dyspnoea for 
2 months.

UCbase 2.0 (http://ucbase.unimore.it) is an update, extension and evolution of 
UCbase, a Web tool dedicated to the analysis of ultraconserved sequences (UCRs). 
UCRs are 481 sequences >200 bases sharing 100% identity among human, mouse and 
rat genomes. They are frequently located in genomic regions known to be involved 
in cancer or differentially expressed in human leukemias and carcinomas. UCbase 
2.0 is a platform-independent Web resource that includes the updated version of 
the human genome annotation (hg19), information linking disorders to chromosomal 
coordinates based on the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine classification, a 
query tool to search for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and a new text 
box to directly interrogate the database using a MySQL interface. To facilitate 
the interactive visual interpretation of UCR chromosomal positioning, UCbase 2.0 
now includes a graph visualization interface directly linked to UCSC genome 
browser. Database URL: http://ucbase.unimore.it.

Treatment of body composition changes in obese and overweight older adults: 
insight into the phenotype of sarcopenic obesity.

In recent years, mounting interest has been directed to sarcopenic obesity (SO), 
given the parallel increase of life expectancy and prevalence of obesity in 
Western countries. The phenotype of SO is characterized by the coexistence of 
excess fat mass and decreased muscle mass, leading to the impairment of physical 
performance. The aim of the present review was to summarize the impact of 
different treatment strategies contrasting body composition changes in older 
obese and overweight subjects, providing insight into the SO phenotype. Revision 
questions were formulated; relevant articles were identified from Pubmed through 
a systematic search strategy: definition of the search terms (sarcopenic 
obesity, diet, nutritional supplements, physical activity, exercise, 
pharmacological treatment); limits: papers published in the last 10 years; 
humans; age ≥ 60 years old; body mass index >25 kg/m(2); language: English. 
Studies dealing with sarcopenia associated to cancer cachexia or neurological 
diseases, any malignant disease, inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, 
corticosteroids for systemic use, bedridden subjects, and syndromic obesity were 
excluded. 14 articles were identified for inclusion in the present systematic 
review, and were grouped basing on the type of the main intervention: data 
assessing body composition changes after combined lifestyle interventions, 
exercise/physical activity, dietary interventions, and pharmacological 
treatment. Most of the studies were randomized, controlled. Sample size ranged 
from 12 to 439 subjects, and study duration varied from 6 weeks to 12 months. 
Weight loss based on diet combined with exercise seems to be the best strategy 
to adopt for treatment of phenotypic aspects of SO, improving metabolic 
consequences related to excess fat, preserving lean mass, and allowing 
functional recovery.

INTRODUCTION: A retrospective clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the 
clinical features and treatment outcomes and to determine the incidence of 
complications in children with congenital neck lesions (CNLs) treated at our 
institution with a special emphasis on thyroglossal duct remnant (TGDR), 
branchial cleft anomaly (BCA), and dermoid cyst (DC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This series had 72 patients with CNL. The diagnosis of 
CNL was made by physical examination, ultrasound (US) in most, and for a 
potential extension of the mass computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) in a few patients and confirmed by histopathological examination 
in all of the children.
RESULTS: Of the patients in this series, 39 (54.2%) children had thyroglossal 
duct remnant (TGDR). The most common surgical procedure (n = 36) in these 
children was Sistrunk's procedure. Four children (10.3%) with TGDR had 
associated anomalies including Turner syndrome and Morgagni hernia. During the 
study period, 25 (34.7%) children with branchial cleft anomaly (BCA) were 
treated and most of these were second branchial anomalies. There were eight 
children (11.1%) with dermoid cyst (DC).
CONCLUSION: TGDR is the most common CNL and is presented clinically rather late 
with regard to BCA and DC in this series. Surgical resection is optimal choice 
of therapy in CNLs not only for aesthetic reasons but also for the recurrent 
infections and the potential danger of malignancy. Definitive surgery may be 
associated with high morbidity, especially recurrence. Associated anomalies may 
be observed, especially in children with TGDR. Although the Sistrunk's procedure 
is a safe and successful technique, life-threatening complications should also 
be kept in mind during the management of these lesions and early and adequate 
surgical treatment is suggested.

OBJECTIVE: Young patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
are generally considered at low procedural risk, but the potentially aggressive 
nature of coronary artery disease and long expectancy of life expose them to a 
high risk of recurrent coronary events. The extent and determinants of disease 
progression in this patient subset remain largely unknown. The aim of the 
present study was to evaluate general risk factors for late outcomes among 
patients ≤50 years old who underwent PCI.
METHODS: Coronary aRtery diseAse in younG adults (CRAGS) is a multicenter 
European retrospective registry that enrolled 1617 patients (age ≤50 years) who 
underwent PCI over the years 2002-2012. The median follow-up was 3.0 years.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were smokers who were nevertheless prescribed 
adequate secondary prevention medication, including statins, aspirin, beta 
blockers and/or ACE inhibitors/AT blockers. At 5 years, survival was 97.8%, 
while freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was 74.1%, 
from repeat revascularization 77.8% and from myocardial infarction 89.9%. 
Altogether 13.5% of patients exhibited disease progression that indicated a need 
for repeat revascularization. Other indications for repeat revascularization 
were restenosis (7.1%) and stent thrombosis (2.1%) at the 5-year follow-up. 
Independent post-PCI predictors of disease progression were multivessel disease, 
diabetes and hypertension.
CONCLUSION: PCI is associated with excellent survival in patients ≤50 years old. 
Nevertheless, despite guideline-adherent medication, every eighth patient 
underwent repeat revascularization due to disease progression diagnosed at the 
median follow-up of three years, underscoring the need for more effective 
secondary prevention than currently available.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the health-related quality of life in children with 
cerebral palsy and their families.
METHODS: One hundred children (3-10 years of age) receiving regular 
rehabilitation therapy for cerebral palsy for last 1 year at a Child Development 
Centrer were enrolled and the Lifestyle assessment questionnaire - cerebral 
palsy was administered to the parents.
RESULTS: 9% had good, 24% had mildly-affected, 37% had moderately-affected and 
30% had severely-affected health-related quality of life. The physical 
independence, mobility and social integration dimensions were much more severely 
affected than the clinical burden, economic burden and schooling dimensions.
CONCLUSION: Health-related quality of child is affected in most children with 
cerebral palsy.

The conventional, or standard, time trade-off (TTO) procedure, which is used to 
elicit the values that people place on health states that are in turn required 
to calculate quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), asks respondents to trade off 
fewer life years for better health. It is possible to reverse the procedure to 
ask respondents to trade off less health for more life years. Theoretically, 
these two procedures should generate the same TTO values for any given health 
state. This article reports that for health states defined by differing 
frequencies of migraine attack, the standard TTO gives health state values that 
are significantly higher than those given by the reverse TTO. The observed 
systematic procedural invariance, which substantiates some previous findings 
reported in the literature and is consistent with a loss aversion effect, 
challenges the validity of the TTO for generating reliable valuations of health 
states.

Advanced anti-cancer regimens are being introduced for more effective cancer 
treatment with improved life expectancy. In this research, immuno-stimulating 
agent toll-like receptor-7 (TLR-7) agonist-imiquimod and low dose 
chemotherapeutic agent-paclitaxel were synergized to demonstrate tumor therapy 
along with anti-tumor memory effect. Both therapeutic agents being water 
insoluble were dispersed in water with the help of water soluble polymer: poly 
(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) using a co-solvent systems leading to formation of 
micro-dispersions of drugs. Paclitaxel and imiquimod formed crystalline 
microstructures in the size range of 2-3 μm and were stably dispersed in γ-PGA 
matrix for more than 6 months. Paclitaxel and combination of paclitaxel and 
imiquimod had significant tumor killing effect in-vitro on various tumor cell 
lines, while antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells-DCs) treated with the 
same concentration of imiquimod along with the combination led to enhanced 
proliferation (250%). In DCs, enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory and Th1 
cytokines was observed in cells co-treated with paclitaxel and imiquimod 
dispersed in γ-PGA. When administered by intra-tumoral injection in mouse 
melanoma tumor model, the treatment with combination exemplified drastic 
inhibition of tumor growth leading to 70% survival as compared to individual 
components with 0% survival at day 41. The anti-tumor response generated was 
also found to have systemic memory response since the vaccinated mice 
significantly deferred secondary tumor development at distant site 6 weeks after 
treatment. The relative number and activation status of DCs in-vivo was found to 
be dramatically increased in case of mice treated with combination. The dramatic 
inhibition of tumor treated with combination is expected to be mediated by both 
chemotherapeutic killing of tumor cells followed by uptake of released antigen 
by the DCs and due to enhanced proliferation and activation of the DCs.

The economic burden of disease by industry: Differences in quality-adjusted life 
years and associated costs.

Author information:
(1)Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida.

BACKGROUND: This study compares differences in quality-adjusted life expectancy 
across the eight original National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) industry 
sectors.
METHODS: Data from the 1997 to 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were 
used to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for all workers and by NORA 
sector. Differences in QALYs were calculated and translated into economic values 
using estimates of the societal willingness-to-pay per QALY.
RESULTS: Mean QALYs across workers was 29.17 years. Among NORA sectors, 
wholesale, and retail trade workers had the highest average QALYs remaining 
(35.88), while mining workers had the lowest QALYs (31.4). The economic value of 
this difference ranges from $604,843 to $1,155,287 per worker depending on the 
societal willingness-to-pay per QALY.
CONCLUSION: The value of life lost within some industries is very high relative 
to others. Additional investments in occupational safety, benefits, and health 
promotion initiatives may reduce these losses, but experimental research is 
needed to assess the effectiveness of such programs.

We develop an optimizing life-cycle model of retirement with perfect capital 
markets. We show that longer healthy life expectancy usually leads to later 
retirement, but with an elasticity less than unity. We calibrate our model using 
data from the US and find that, over the last century, the effect of rising 
incomes, which promote early retirement, has dominated the effect of rising 
lifespans. Our model predicts continuing declines in the optimal retirement age, 
despite rising life expectancy, provided the rate of real wage growth remains as 
high as in the last century.

Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC) represents the most common 
endocrine malignancy. Despite excellent prognoses exceeding 90% in 10-year 
follow-up, there are clinically controversial issues. One of these is 
extrathyroidal tumour extension invading recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). The 
spread outside of the thyroid parenchyma and invasion to the surrounding 
structures, classified as always T4a, are the most important negative prognostic 
factor for the WDTC. Conversely, resection of the RLN leads to vocal cord 
paralysis with hoarseness, possible swallowing problems, and finally decreased 
quality of life. We propose a new algorithm for intraoperative management based 
on the MACIS classification, which would allow swift status evaluation 
pre/intraoperatively and consider a possibility to preserve the infiltrated RLN 
without compromising an oncological radicality. In the case of a preoperative 
vocal cord paralysis (VCP) and confirmation of the invasive carcinoma, a 
resection of the RLN and the nerve graft reconstruction are indicated. 
Preoperatively, unaffected vocal cord movement and intraoperatively detected RLN 
infiltration by the invasive WDTC require an individual assessment of the 
oncological risk by the proposed algorithm. Preservation of the infiltrated RLN 
is oncologically acceptable only in specific groups of patients of a younger age 
with a minor size of primary tumour.

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a severely disabling complication of 
steroid immunosuppression in renal transplant patients. The increased number of 
patients undergoing transplantation has increased the number of transplant 
recipients undergoing total hip replacement arthroplasty (THRA). In this study, 
we retrospectively assessed patients who underwent THRA from May 2004 to 
February 2014, and evaluated their demographic and clinical characteristics, the 
results of peri-operative laboratory tests, the amounts of fluids transfused 
during surgery, and anesthesia time. Our results found that post-operative acute 
kidney injury (AKI) was significantly associated with transplantation, and 
transplantation was an independent factor predictive of post-operative AKI, so 
transplant recipients are at risk for AKI following THRA. Total hip replacement 
is a safe and effective treatment for transplant recipients and, in view of 
their limited life expectancy, should be considered at an early stage in their 
treatment.

Lodovico.Balducci@Moffitt.org.

BACKGROUND: Data relating to cancer treatment in the older patient population 
are limited because older individuals have been under-represented in clinical 
trials. The goal of this review was to establish which factors hinder the 
participation of older individuals to clinical trials and to examine possible 
solutions.
METHODS: The literature relating to cancer treatment in the older patient 
population was reviewed.
RESULTS: The benefit of systemic cancer treatment may decrease with age, and 
risks may be increased due to reduced life expectancy and reduced tolerance of 
stress in the older population. Therefore, a multipronged approach is 
recommended for clinical studies in these patients, including phase 2 studies 
limited to persons 70 years of age and older, stratification by life expectancy 
and predicted treatment tolerance in phase 3 studies, and registration studies 
to establish predictive variables for treatment-related toxicity in older 
individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of prospective and registration studies may supply 
adequate information to study cancer treatments in the older patient population.

Two tandem RNase III cleavage sites determine betT mRNA stability in response to 
osmotic stress in Escherichia coli.

While identifying genes regulated by ribonuclease III (RNase III) in Escherichia 
coli, we observed that steady-state levels of betT mRNA, which encodes a 
transporter mediating the influx of choline, are dependent on cellular 
concentrations of RNase III. In the present study, we also observed that 
steady-state levels of betT mRNA are dependent on RNase III activity upon 
exposure to osmotic stress, indicating the presence of cis-acting elements 
controlled by RNase III in betT mRNA. Primer extension analyses of betT mRNA 
revealed two tandem RNase III cleavage sites in its stem-loop region, which were 
biochemically confirmed via in vitro cleavage assays. Analyses of cleavage sites 
suggested the stochastic selection of cleavage sites by RNase III, and 
mutational analyses indicated that RNase III cleavage at either site 
individually is insufficient for efficient betT mRNA degradation. In addition, 
both the half-life and abundance of betT mRNA were significantly increased in 
association with decreased RNase III activity under hyper-osmotic stress 
conditions. Our findings demonstrate that betT mRNA stability is controlled by 
RNase III at the post-transcriptional level under conditions of osmotic stress.

BACKGROUND: This study examined clinically diagnosed depression as a risk factor 
for incidence of death by stroke in a prospective clinically based design study. 
Risk for stroke was examined separately by sex in a long-term follow-up study 
spanning 40 years.
METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with depression in the Chichester 
(population 100,000)/Salisbury (population 85,000) Catchment Area Study were 
followed up for 40 years. Death certificates were used to determine the cause of 
death in the cohort. Death rates in the general population, adjusted for age, 
gender, and year, were used as a control.
RESULTS: Clinical depression was found to be a risk factor for subsequent death 
from stroke in men but not in women. Death by stroke was a statistically 
significant cause of death in the men with diagnoses of endogenous depression 
but not in those men diagnosed with reactive depression. The strength of the 
relationship of depression with stroke increased over time.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the identification of depressive 
symptoms at younger ages may have an impact on the primary prevention of stroke 
in later life. The notion that depression has stronger effects over a long 
period is consistent with a view that severe clinical depression and physical 
illness occur concurrently, one exacerbating the other, and health is degraded 
through slow-acting, cumulative processes. Data were unavailable for the type of 
stroke or the health-risk behaviors (smoking, diet, and so forth) in the cohort 
which constituted a limitation of the study. Neither is it known what proportion 
of the cohort suffered a nonlethal stroke nor to what extent the treatment of 
clinical depression militates against suffering a lethal stroke.

BACKGROUND: Longer life expectancy and changes in family patterns in Western 
societies have increased the need for professional caregivers to the elderly. A 
detailed understanding of job resources, especially of job control, may help 
preserve eldercare workers' work-related well-being.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine optimal levels of job 
control for eldercare workers' work-related well-being.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional (Study 1) and longitudinal (Study 2) data were used to 
assess the linear and non-linear relations between job control and eldercare 
workers' work-related well-being. As indicators of well-being, irritation was 
examined cross-sectionally, whereas burnout and engagement were used in the 
longitudinal study. In both studies, demographic variables and time pressure 
were included as controls. In Study 2, results were additionally controlled for 
baseline levels of the outcome variables.
PARTICIPANTS: Study participants were recruited from the nursing staff of 10 
publicly financed nursing homes for the elderly (Study 1) and from 18 privately 
and 20 publicly financed nursing homes for the elderly (Study 2). In both 
studies, eldercare workers (i.e., registered nurses, orderlies, and nursing 
assistants) were invited to answer paper-pencil questionnaires. In Study 1, 606 
persons followed this invitation (response rate: 65%). In Study 2, 591 persons 
provided data on both measurement points (response rate: 35% of Time 1 
participants). The samples of both studies were predominantly female and between 
20 and 65 years of age.
METHODS: Hierarchical multiple regressions with linear and quadratic terms were 
conducted.
RESULTS: Curvilinear effects of job control were found in both studies. In Study 
1, low as well as high levels of job control were associated with higher levels 
of irritation compared to medium levels of job control. The longitudinal data 
from Study 2 supported these results. Eldercare workers with higher and lower 
levels of job control reported a higher tendency to depersonalize care 
recipients and a lower tendency to feel dedicated to, absorbed by and vigorous 
at work than those with medium levels of job control.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of job control are not necessarily advantageous for 
work-related well-being of eldercare workers.

HIV testing uptake has increased dramatically in recent years in resource 
limited settings. Nevertheless, over 50% of the people living with HIV are still 
unaware of their status. HIV self-testing (HIVST) is a potential new approach to 
facilitate further uptake of testing which requires consideration, taking into 
account economic factors. Mathematical models and associated economic analysis 
can provide useful assistance in decision-making processes, offering insight, in 
this case, into the potential long-term impact at a population level and the 
price-point at which free or subsidized HIVST would be cost-effective in a given 
setting. However, models are based on assumptions, and if the required data are 
sparse or limited, this uncertainty will be reflected in the results from 
mathematical models. The aim of this paper is to describe the issues encountered 
in modeling the cost-effectiveness of introducing HIVST, to indicate the 
evidence needed to support various modeling assumptions, and thus which data on 
HIVST would be most beneficial to collect.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the second most common 
cause of hospital-acquired infection. A number of strategies have been put 
forward to prevent CAUTI, including the use of antimicrobial catheters. We aimed 
to assess whether the use of either a nitrofurazone-impregnated or a silver 
alloy-coated catheter was cost-effective compared with standard 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated catheters. A decision-analytic model using 
data from a clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom was used to calculate 
the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We assumed that 
differences in costs and QALYs were driven by difference in risk of acquiring a 
CAUTI. Routine use of nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters was, on average, £7 
(€9) less costly than use of the standard catheter over 6 wk. There was a >70% 
chance that use of nitrofurazone catheters would be cost saving and an 84% 
chance that the incremental cost per QALY would be less than £30 000 (€36 851; a 
commonly used threshold for society's willingness to pay). Silver alloy-coated 
catheters were very unlikely to be cost-effective. The model's prediction, 
although associated with uncertainty, was that nitrofurazone-impregnated 
catheters may be cost-effective in the UK National Health System or a similar 
setting.

Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the mandible is a rare and potentially 
life-threatening condition which can lead to massive hemorrhage. The following 
is a description where a large mandibular AVM presented with torrential bleeding 
following tooth extraction for caries. An orthopantomogram (OPG) was performed 
which was suggestive of aneurysmal bone cyst or ameloblastoma. A computed 
tomography (CT) angiography revealed a large mandibular AVM with submandibular 
extension. It is important for both clinicians and radiologist to be aware of 
this type of lesion that can have life-threatening complications. It is 
important to define the anatomical location and the feeder vessels of the entity 
in detail preoperatively. This communication highlights the common differential 
and use of multidetector CT (MDCT) angiography along with other imaging 
modalities to prevent a fatal hemorrhage and arrive at a correct diagnosis.

Hepatitis C virus infection and dialysis: 2012 update.

Padiglione Croff, Via Commenda 15, 20122 Milan, Italy.

Hepatitis C virus infection is still common among dialysis patients, but the 
natural history of HCV in this group is not completely understood. Recent 
evidence has been accumulated showing that anti-HCV positive serologic status is 
significantly associated with lower survival in dialysis population; an 
increased risk of liver and cardiovascular disease-related mortality compared 
with anti-HCV negative subjects has been found. According to a novel 
meta-analysis (fourteen studies including 145,608 unique patients), the adjusted 
RR for liver disease-related death and cardiovascular mortality was 3.82 (95% 
CI, 1.92; 7.61) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.10; 1.45), respectively. It has been 
suggested that the decision to treat HCV in patients with chronic kidney disease 
be based on the potential benefits and risks of therapy, including life 
expectancy, candidacy for kidney transplant, and co-morbidities. According to 
recent guidelines, the antiviral treatment of choice in HCV-infected patients on 
dialysis is mono-therapy but fresh data suggest the use of modern antiviral 
approaches (i.e., pegylated interferon plus ribavirin). The summary estimate for 
sustained viral response and drop-out rate was 56% (95% CI, 28-84) and 25% (95% 
CI, 10-40) in a pooled analysis including 151 dialysis patients on combination 
antiviral therapy (conventional or pegylated interferon plus ribavirin).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This review focuses on health-related quality-of-life 
(HRQoL) assessment questionnaires and the influence of various parameters on 
HRQoL at distinct time points after laparoscopic colectomy for cancer.
METHODS: A PubMed electronic database literature search was conducted.
RESULTS: Twenty studies (7 prospective randomized, 5 nonrandomized, 2 
retrospective, 1 matched, and 3 observational studies) used the following HRQoL 
tools: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 
Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 (8 studies), EORTC QLQ-CR38 (6 studies), 
EORTC QLQ-CR29 (1 study), Short Form 36 (8 studies), Gastrointestinal Quality 
Life Index (2 studies), EuroQoL-5D (1 study), Symptoms Distress Scale (2 
studies), Quality of Life Index (2 studies), and global quality of life (1 
study). Long-term beneficial effects on patient HRQoL after laparoscopic 
colectomy for cancer have not been clearly shown compared with "open" 
resections. A physical function deterioration and emotional function improvement 
are observed during the first month. Most patients have recovered at 12 months. 
Distinct HRQoL domains may be affected in older, female, and 
chemotherapy-treated patients. HRQoL-related parameters of pain and cosmesis 
have been assessed in few of the current studies on hand-assisted and 
single-incision laparoscopic colectomy.
CONCLUSION: Studies' heterogeneity in terms of assessment tools and time points 
remains as the main obstacle to establish robust conclusions. The addition of 
more patients and extension of the follow-up period will improve our knowledge 
on HRQoL changes after laparoscopic colectomy for cancer.

[The age and sex indicators of mortality of population and years of life lost as 
a result of premature mortality in the Russian Federation in 2012].

[Article in Russian]

Boiytsov SA, Samorodskaya IV.

The age-specific mortality coefficients and years of life lost as a result of 
premature mortality are among important medical demographic characteristics of 
population health. The study analyzed age and sex indicators of mortality of 
population in the Russian Federation. The number of years of life lost as a 
result of premature mortality is calculated. The comparison of values of years 
of life lost in various subjects of the Russian Federation was carried out. The 
data of Rosstat concerning population size and number of the deceased in year 
age groups in the Russian Federation and subjects of the Russian Federation in 
2012 was used. The indicator was calculated on the basis of technique included 
into "The global burden of diseases report" (2010). The minimal indicators of 
mortality of males are noted at the age of 11 years (25.4 per 100 000 of 
population) and females at the age of 10 years (18.2 per 100 000 of population). 
The maximal differences in indicators of mortality of males and females are 
marked in the age group 20-29 years (314.5 of males and 92.3 of females per 100 
000 of population). The percentage of deceased prior 70 years consists 63.2% 
among males and 29.9% among females. The total number of years of life lost in 
the Russian Federation consisted 36 864 309 and out of them 24 321 992 (65.9%) 
as a result of death of males and 12 542 317 (34.1%) as a result of death of 
females. The maximum percentage of years of life lost among males is marked in 
the age group of 51-60 years (24.61%) and among females in the age group of 
71-80 years (22.38%). The indicator of years of life lost per 100 000 of 
population consisted 25769 for total population, 36 753 for male population and 
16 314 for female population. The highest rate of indicator of years of life 
lost is marked in the Chukchi Autonomous Okrug and the lowest rate in the 
Republics of the Northern Caucasus and Moscow. However, in all subjects of the 
Russian Federation indicator of years of life lost is higher than in 
economically developed countries. The highest rate of indicator of years of life 
lost in the age group of up to 70 years is marked among males in regions of 
Siberia and Far East.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common 
presentation in hospital-based emergency departments (EDs). A novel diagnostic 
approach is to use video capsule endoscopy to directly visualize the upper GI 
tract and identify bleeding. Our objective was to evaluate and compare the 
relative costs and benefits of video capsule endoscopy compared to other 
strategies in low- to moderate-risk ED patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage.
METHODS: We constructed a model using standard decision analysis software to 
examine the cost-effectiveness of 4 available strategies for a base-case patient 
who presents to the ED with either mild- or moderate-risk scenarios (by 
Glasgow-Blatchford Score) for requiring invasive hemostatic intervention (ie, 
endoscopic, surgical, etc) The 4 available diagnostic strategies were (1) direct 
imaging with video capsule endoscopy performed in the ED; (2) risk 
stratification using the Glasgow-Blatchford score; (3) nasogastric tube 
placement; and, finally, (4) an admit-all strategy.
RESULTS: In the low-risk scenario, video capsule endoscopy was the preferred 
strategy (cost $5691, 14.69 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) and was more 
cost-effective than the remaining strategies including nasogastric tube strategy 
(cost $8159, 14.69 QALYs), risk stratification strategy (cost $10,695, 14.69 
QALYs), and admit-all strategy (cost $22,766, 14.68 QALYs). In the moderate-risk 
scenario, video capsule endoscopy continued to be the preferred strategy (cost 
$9190, 14.56 QALYs) compared to nasogastric tube (cost $9487, 14.58 QALYs, 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $15,891) and more cost effective than 
admit-all strategy (cost, $22,584, 14.54 QALYs.)
CONCLUSION: Video capsule endoscopy may be cost-effective for low- and 
moderate-risk patients presenting to the ED with acute upper GI hemorrhage.

analysis.

BACKGROUND: Comparative trials evaluating management strategies for colorectal 
cancer liver metastases (CLM) are lacking, especially for older patients. This 
study developed a decision-analytic model to quantify outcomes associated with 
treatment strategies for CLM in older patients.
METHODS: A Markov-decision model was built to examine the effect on life 
expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for best supportive 
care (BSC), systemic chemotherapy (SC), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and 
hepatic resection (HR). The baseline patient cohort assumptions included healthy 
70-year-old CLM patients after a primary cancer resection. Event and transition 
probabilities and utilities were derived from a literature review. Deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed on all study parameters.
RESULTS: In base case analysis, BSC, SC, RFA and HR yielded LEs of 11.9, 23.1, 
34.8 and 37.0 months, and QALEs of 7.8, 13.2, 22.0 and 25.0 months, 
respectively. Model results were sensitive to age, comorbidity, length of model 
simulation and utility after HR. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed 
increasing preference for RFA over HR with increasing patient age.
CONCLUSIONS: HR may be optimal for healthy 70-year-old patients with CLM. In 
older patients with comorbidities, RFA may provide better LE and QALE. Treatment 
decisions in older cancer patients should account for patient age, 
comorbidities, local expertise and individual values.
