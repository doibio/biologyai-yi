arbitrary cost-effectiveness threshold may not be sufficient to capture the 
drug-development dynamics occurring at the disease level and successfully direct 
research to the disease areas that are most valued by society.

'If you feel that nobody wants you you'll withdraw into your own': 
Gypsies/Travellers, networks and healthcare utilisation.

Smith D(1), Ruston A.

Gypsies and Travellers are the unhealthiest group in British society, suffering 
from higher levels of physical and mental illness, lower life expectancy and 
with low levels of healthcare utilisation. They also continue to experience the 
highest level of prejudice and discrimination in society. While studies indicate 
that social networks play an important role in shaping health beliefs and the 
response to symptoms, evidence on the influence of networks on health is unclear 
and contradictory. This article draws on social network theory and research into 
the relation between discrimination and health to critically examine how 
networks mediate between collective experiences of racism and health-related 
behavior. Qualitative interviews with 39 adult Gypsies and Travellers were 
conducted in the South-East of England to explore the wider structural and 
institutional context and the influence those contexts play in shaping health 
beliefs and decisions whether to access formal health services. The findings 
indicate that the influence networks play in shaping health behaviour is 
dependent on the particular social context of the group and its status in 
relation to wider social structures, making generalization problematic.

Health, London, United Kingdom. s.byford@kcl.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: Despite a preference for economic evaluations to measure outcomes in 
terms of quality-adjusted life years, generic measures of outcome are rarely 
used in mental health research involving young people.
AIMS: To explore the validity and responsiveness of the EQ-5D measure of 
health-related quality of life in adolescents with major depression.
METHOD: Data came from a clinical trial involving adolescents with persistent 
major depression (n =  199). Construct validity was tested using 
socio-demographic constructs and baseline clinical outcome scores. To assess 
convergent validity, correlation between EQ-5D and clinical outcome scores was 
tested. To assess responsiveness, the mean change in EQ-5D scores of 
participants categorised as improved versus not improved on clinical outcome 
measures was tested.
RESULTS: Significant differences in mean EQ-5D score were found for co-morbidity 
and three of four severity measures but not gender, age, treatment history or 
suicide attempts. Mean EQ-5D scores were significantly correlated with all 
clinical outcome measures, although relationships were moderate or weak. A 
change in mean EQ-5D score was significantly related to clinical assessments of 
improvement on all outcome measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Results provide initial evidence to support the relevance of the 
EQ-5D in adolescents with major depression, but this evidence is weak. 
Replication studies are needed to assess the generalisability of these findings.

Cost-effectiveness of cardiovascular magnetic resonance and single-photon 
emission computed tomography for diagnosis of coronary artery disease in 
Germany.

Virchow-Klinikum Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin 13353, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated a superior diagnostic accuracy of 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for the detection of coronary artery 
disease (CAD). We aimed to determine the comparative cost-effectiveness of CMR 
versus single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
METHODS: Based on Bayes' theorem, a mathematical model was developed to compare 
the cost-effectiveness and utility of CMR with SPECT in patients with suspected 
CAD. Invasive coronary angiography served as the standard of reference. 
Effectiveness was defined as the accurate detection of CAD, and utility as the 
number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Model input parameters 
were derived from the literature, and the cost analysis was conducted from a 
German health care payer's perspective. Extensive sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Reimbursement fees represented only a minor fraction of the total costs 
incurred by a diagnostic strategy. Increases in the prevalence of CAD were 
generally associated with improved cost-effectiveness and decreased costs per 
utility unit (ΔQALY). By comparison, CMR was consistently more cost-effective 
than SPECT, and showed lower costs per QALY gained. Given a CAD prevalence of 
0.50, CMR was associated with total costs of €6,120 for one patient correctly 
diagnosed as having CAD and with €2,246 per ΔQALY gained versus €7,065 and 
€2,931 for SPECT, respectively. Above a threshold value of CAD prevalence of 
0.60, proceeding directly to invasive angiography was the most cost-effective 
approach.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with low to intermediate CAD probabilities, CMR is more 
cost-effective than SPECT. Moreover, lower costs per utility unit indicate a 
superior clinical utility of CMR.

Sarcopenia and fragility fractures.

Sciences, Uppsala University, Sweden. stefania.maggi@in.cnr.it

Sarcopenia, a reduction in muscle mass and muscle function, is considered one of 
the hallmarks of the aging process. Current views consider sarcopenia as the 
consequence of multiple medical, behavioural and environmental factors that 
characterize aged individuals. Likewise bone fragility is known to depend on 
several pathogenetic mechanisms leading to bone mass loss and reduction of bone 
strength. Muscle weakness, fear of falls, falls and subsequent fractures are 
associated to concurrent sarcopenia and osteoporosis and lead to restricted 
mobility, loss of autonomy and reduced life expectancy. The skeletal and the 
muscular organ systems are tightly intertwined: the strongest mechanical forces 
applied to bones are, indeed, those created by muscle contractions that 
condition bone density, strength, and microarchitecture. Not surprising, 
therefore, the decrease in muscle strength leads to lower bone strength. The 
degenerative processes leading to osteoporosis and sarcopenia show many common 
pathogenic pathways, like the sensitivity to reduced anabolic hormone secretion, 
increased inflammatory cytokine activity and reduced physical activity. Thus 
they may also respond to the same kind of treatments. Basic is life-style 
interventions related to exercise and nutrition. Sufficient vitamin D levels are 
of importance for both bone and muscle, primarily provided by sun exposure at 
younger age, and by supplementation at older age. Resistance training several 
times per week is crucial, and to be effective adequate access to energy and 
proteins is necessary.

An individualized conditional survival calculator for patients with rectal 
cancer.

Center, Houston, Texas 77230-1402, USA.

BACKGROUND: Conditional survival estimates account for time survived since 
diagnosis to provide prognostic information for long-term cancer survivors. For 
rectal cancer, stage-related treatment (eg, neoadjuvant radiotherapy) affects 
pathologic stage and therefore stage-associated survival estimates.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to estimate conditional survival for 
patients who have rectal cancer and to develop an interactive calculator to use 
for individualized patient counseling.
PATIENTS: Patients with rectal adenocarcinoma were identified by using the 
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry (1988-2002, N = 22,610).
DESIGN: Cox regression models were developed to determine adjusted survival 
estimates (years 1-10) and used to calculate 5-year adjusted conditional 
survival. Models were built separately for no radiotherapy, preoperative 
radiotherapy, postoperative radiotherapy, and patients with stage IV disease. 
Covariates included age, sex, race, tumor grade, and type of surgery. An 
Internet-based conditional survival calculator was developed.
RESULTS: Radiotherapy was given to 42.6% of patients (14.1% preoperative, 28.4% 
postoperative). Significant improvements in 5-year conditional survival were 
observed for all stages, with the exception of stage I because of the initial 
high survival probability at diagnosis. Patients with advanced stage had the 
greatest improvements in conditional survival, with 5-year absolute increases of 
33% (stage IIIC) and 54% (IV). Other factors associated with conditional 
survival included sequence of radiotherapy and surgery, age, race, and tumor 
grade. The Internet-based conditional survival calculator can be accessed at 
www.mdanderson.org/rectalcalculator.
LIMITATIONS: The data source used does not include information on chemotherapy 
treatment, change in staging after neoadjuvant treatment, or patient 
comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: Conditional survival estimates improve over 5 years in patients who 
have rectal cancer; the greatest improvements are observed among patients with 
advanced stage disease. The conditional survival calculator is an individualized 
decision support tool that informs patients, who must make non-treatment-related 
life decisions, and their clinicians planning follow-up and surveillance.

leaf monkeys (Trachypithecus cristatus).

This study examines mortality in the North American (N.A.) population of 
silvered leaf monkeys (Trachypithecus cristatus) maintained in Association of 
Zoos and Aquarium's zoos. Understanding the causes of death associated with 
mortality rates (MR) can highlight relative susceptibility to 
intrinsic/extrinsic factors and differences between age and sex classes. 
Overall, life tables can provide insight into a species' population dynamics. We 
expect that the MR will fit the general mammalian and primate trends of a 
U-shaped curve when graphed, that males will have a higher MR and shorter life 
expectancy than females and that infant survival will be higher in captivity 
than in wild populations. Our results indicate that the N.A. captive population 
fits expected MR trends of a U-shaped curve. However, no differences in MR or 
life expectancy were found between the sexes. Infant survivorship did not differ 
from the wild or other leaf monkey populations (both captive and wild). The 
majority of infant deaths occurred on day 1 of life (52.8% of all infant deaths) 
and infant survivorship to 1 year was 66%. Neonates (n = 6, 31.6%) and infants 
(n = 4, 44.4%) died from trauma, juveniles (n = 2, 33.3%) from nutritional 
reasons, adults from non-infectious diseases (n = 7, 29.2%) and from 
post-surgical complications (n = 7, 29.2%), and older adults from idiopathic 
diseases (n = 4, 26.7%) and non-infectious diseases (n = 4, 26.7%). Only older 
adult males died from degenerative diseases (i.e., heart failure, n = 3, 42.9%). 
In general, this captive population demonstrated some similar trends to those 
observed in mammalian and Old World monkey populations.

Priority setting in global health: towards a minimum DALY value.

Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK; Faculty of Public 
Health, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.

Rational and analytic healthcare decision making employed by many national 
healthcare-funding bodies could also be expected from global health donors. Cost 
effectiveness analysis of healthcare investment options presents the 
effectiveness of a particular action in proportion to the resources required, 
and cost effectiveness thresholds, while somewhat arbitrary, define the level at 
which the investment can be considered value for money. Currently, cost 
effectiveness thresholds reflect the national budget context or 
willingness-to-pay, which is problematic when making cross-country comparisons. 
Defining a global minimum monetary value for the disability adjusted life year 
(DALY) would in effect set a global baseline cost effectiveness threshold. A 
global minimum DALY value would reflect a universal minimum value on human 
health, irrespective of a national provider's willingness or ability to pay. A 
minimum DALY value and associated threshold has both limitations and flaws but 
is justified on similar grounds to the Millennium Development Goals or the 
absolute poverty threshold and has the potential to radically improve 
transparency and efficiency of priority setting in global health.

Objective evaluation of cervical spine mobility after surgery during free-living 
activity.

Author information:

Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. cyntia.duc@epfl.ch

BACKGROUND: Evaluation of cervical spine mobility after surgery is mainly based 
on the measurement of the range of motion during imposed movements. It can thus 
be questionable if this assessment represents the mobility experienced during 
daily life. The goal of this study was to propose a new evaluation tool based on 
the monitoring of cervical spine movement during daily activities.
METHODS: The detection of cervical movement and the determination of primary 
motion component (lateral bending, axial rotation or flexion-extension), using 
two inertial sensors, were first validated in laboratory settings. Fifteen 
patients who underwent a cervical arthrodesis and nine healthy control subjects 
were monitored during their daily activity for half a day. The frequency of 
cervical movement was quantified according to posture, i.e. static and walking 
periods. The amplitude and velocity of cervical movement were evaluated using 
the median and cumulative distribution function.
FINDINGS: The movement detection and classification showed an excellent 
performance (sensitivity and specificity>94%). For the daily monitoring, the 
patients presented a movement frequency similar to controls, whereas the 
amplitude and velocity in patients were lower than in controls (P<0.05). The 
differences between patients and controls were larger for the velocity 
parameters (effect sizes>0.37 and >0.54 for static and walking periods 
respectively) than for the amplitude parameters.
INTERPRETATION: Body-worn inertial sensors enable the quantitative evaluation of 
global cervical movement. The movement amplitude and velocity during free-living 
conditions can be used as objective parameters to evaluate the cervical spine 
mobility after treatment.

United Kingdom (Wales): Health system review.

Longley M(1), Riley N, Davies P, Hernandez-Quevedo C.

Author information:
(1)Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care, University of Glamorgan, UK.

Wales is situated to the west of England, with a population of approximately 3 
million (5% of the total for the United Kingdom), and a land mass of just over 
20 000 km2. For several decades, Wales had a health system largely administered 
through the United Kingdom Governments Welsh Office, but responsibility for most 
aspects of health policy was devolved to Wales in a process beginning in 1999. 
Since then, differences between the policy approach and framework in England and 
Wales have widened. The internal market introduced in the United Kingdom 
National Health Service (NHS) has been abandoned in Wales, and seven local 
health boards (LHBs; supported by three specialist NHS trusts) now plan and 
provide all health services for their resident populations. Wales currently has 
more than 120 hospitals as part of an overall estate valued at 2.3 billion 
pounds. Total spending on health services increased in the first decade of the 
21st century, but Wales now faces a period of financial retrenchment greater 
than in other parts of the United Kingdom as a result of the Welsh Governments 
decision not to afford the same degree of protection to health spending as that 
granted elsewhere. The health system in Wales continues to face some structural 
weaknesses that have proved resistant to reform for some time. However, there 
has been substantial improvement in service quality and outcomes since the end 
of the 1990s, in large part facilitated by substantial real growth in health 
spending. Life expectancy has continued to increase, but health inequalities 
have proved stubbornly resistant to improvement.

Aged parents' experiences during a critical illness trajectory and after the 
death of an adult child: a review of the literature.

BACKGROUND: Given the growing life expectancy, the likelihood increases that 
health-care providers are confronted with older people having an adult child 
with a life-limiting disease.
AIM: This literature review aimed to (1) explore the experiences of aged parents 
with regard to their position and role as a parent of an adult child with a 
life-limiting illness, (2) detect gaps in the existing literature and (3) make 
recommendations for future research.
DESIGN: A literature search of English articles, including both quantitative and 
qualitative designs.
DATA SOURCES: Four electronic databases and the reference lists of included 
studies.
RESULTS: In total, 19 studies (7 quantitative and 12 qualitative) were included. 
Few studies describe the experiences of older people whose adult child has 
cancer or has died of cancer. Existing studies are merely descriptive and give 
no concrete recommendations for health-care providers in daily practice. The 
studies suggest that aged parents carry deep burdens from the prospect of losing 
their adult child. Aged parents want to stay involved but need to reconfigure 
their parent role. As soon as the cancer diagnosis is disclosed, parents are 
confronted with a re-awakening of parental nurturing, which clashes with the 
autonomy of the adult child. Even after the adult child is deceased, older 
parents retain the image of themselves as parents.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more in-depth research to understand the lived 
experience of these parents and what health-care providers can do to assist 
them.

Mandibular implant supported complete dentures improved quality of life.

Keenan AV(1).

Author information:
(1)NYU College of Dentistry, New York, USA.

Comment on
    Clin Oral Implants Res. 2013 Jan;24(1):96-103.

DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial.
INTERVENTION: Patients from hospital waiting lists who had been edentulous for 
at least two years and required replacement of conventional dentures were 
recruited. Baseline quality of life and satisfaction measures were taken and all 
patients were provided with new conventional complete dentures (CCDs) that they 
wore for three months, at which point they were reassessed using the same 
measures. Patients were then randomly assigned either to continue with CCDs 
(control) or to have implant-retained overdentures (IODs) made (test group). The 
control group was assessed after a further three months (six months after 
receiving CCDs). The test group was assessed three months after receiving IODs.
OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcome measures used were the Oral Health Impact 
Profile-49 (OHIP-49) Denture Satisfaction Questionnaire (DSQ) and the Schedule 
for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life (SEIQoL).
RESULTS: Three months after receiving CCDs patients reported significant 
improvements in satisfaction and quality of life (P < 0.05). However no further 
improvements were seen in the control group at six months for any measure. 
Following placement of IODs the test groups had significant additional 
improvements in the functional limitation, physical pain, psychological 
discomfort, physical disability, social disability, psychological disability and 
handicap scales of the OHIP and on 10 of the 11 scales of the Denture 
Satisfaction Questionnaire (P < 0.05, ANOVA).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that, controlling for expectancy bias and 
variability in baseline levels, IODs significantly increase patient 
satisfaction, dental function and quality of life over and above those achieved 
with good quality CCDs.

Genetic stabilization of transthyretin, cerebrovascular disease, and life 
expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: Transthyretin can cause amyloidosis attributable to destabilization 
of transthyretin tetramers in plasma. We tested the hypothesis that genetic 
stabilization of transthyretin associates with reduced risk of vascular disease 
and increased life expectancy.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We included 68 602 participants from 2 prospective studies 
of the general population. We genotyped for 2 stabilizing genetic variants in 
the transthyretin gene (TTR), R104H and T119M, and determined the association of 
genotypes with plasma levels of transthyretin, measures of thyroid function, 
risk of vascular disease, and life expectancy. During a mean follow-up of 32 
years, 10 636 participants developed vascular disease. We identified 321 
heterozygotes for T119M (frequency, 0.47%); R104H was not detected. First, mean 
plasma transthyretin and thyroxine levels were increased by 17% (26 µg/mL) and 
20% (19 nmol/L), respectively, in heterozygotes versus noncarriers (P=0.007 and 
P<0.0001), demonstrating functionality of this variant in the general 
population. Second, corresponding hazard ratios were 0.70 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.51-0.97) for all vascular diseases, 0.85 (0.59-1.23) for 
cardiovascular disease, 0.45 (0.25-0.81) for cerebrovascular disease, 0.47 
(0.25-0.88) for ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and 0.31 (0.04-2.22) for 
hemorrhagic stroke. The cumulative incidence of cerebrovascular disease as a 
function of age was decreased in heterozygotes versus noncarriers (P=0.005). 
Third, median age at death from all causes, from vascular and cerebrovascular 
diseases, and after diagnosis of vascular disease, and median age at diagnosis 
of vascular disease, was increased by 5 to 10 years in heterozygotes versus 
noncarriers (P=0.002-0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These results are compatible with an association between genetic 
stabilization of transthyretin and decreased risk of cerebrovascular disease, 
and with increased life expectancy in the general population.

Cabazitaxel for the second-line treatment of metastatic hormone-refractory 
prostate cancer: a NICE single technology appraisal.

4DA, UK. b.kearns@sheffield.ac.uk

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer of cabazitaxel (Jevtana®, sanofi-aventis, UK) to submit evidence of 
its clinical and cost effectiveness for the second-line treatment of metastatic 
hormone-refractory prostate cancer (mHRPC). The School of Health and Related 
Research Technology Appraisal Group (ScHARR-TAG) at the University of Sheffield 
was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG 
produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost 
effectiveness of the technology based upon the manufacturer's submission to 
NICE. Clinical evidence was derived from a multinational randomized open-label 
phase III trial of cabazitaxel plus prednisone or prednisolone in men with mHRPC 
that had progressed during or following treatment with docetaxel. The comparator 
was mitoxantrone plus prednisone or prednisolone. Use of cabazitaxel was 
associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, 
median progression-free survival and time to tumour progression. However, it was 
also associated with an increased incidence of adverse events such as 
neutropenia. Utility data were based on interim results from the early access 
programme for cabazitaxel. Data were only available for a small number of 
patients with stable disease, resulting in great uncertainty as to the effect of 
cabazitaxel on quality of life. For their economic evaluation, the manufacturer 
estimated that the use of cabazitaxel was associated with an incremental cost of 
£74,908 per QALY gained. However, the ERG disagreed with the manufacturer over 
two key methodological points. The first concerned modelling and extrapolating 
survival; the second point was concerned with the choice of patient population. 
The ERG altered the manufacturer's evaluation to take into account these two 
points of disagreement. The resulting cost per QALY gained was £82,950. The NICE 
Appraisal Committee believed the analysis presented by the ERG to be more 
plausible, and likely to be an underestimate of the cost per QALY. They 
concluded that whilst the clinical effectiveness of cabazitaxel had been proven, 
it was not likely to represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources and so its 
use could not be recommended.

BACKGROUND: Case management undertaken by healthcare assistants in small primary 
care practices is effective in improving depression symptoms and adherence in 
patients with major depression.
AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of depression case management by 
healthcare assistants in small primary care practices.
METHOD: Cost-effectiveness analysis on the basis of a pragmatic randomised 
controlled trial (2005-2008): practice-based healthcare assistants in 74 
practices provided case management to 562 patients with major depression over 1 
year. Our primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
calculated as the ratio of differences in mean costs and mean number of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Our secondary outcome was the mean 
depression-free days (DFDs) between the intervention and control group at 
24-month follow-up. The study was registered at the International Standard 
Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry: ISRCTN66386086.
RESULTS: Intervention v. control group: no significant difference in QALYs; 
significantly more DFDs (mean: 373 v. 311, P<0.01); no significant difference in 
mean direct healthcare costs (€4495 v. €3506, P = 0.16); considerably lower mean 
indirect costs (€5228 v. €7539, P = 0.06), resulting in lower total costs (€9723 
v. €11 045, P = 0.41). The point estimate for the cost-utility ratio was €38 429 
per QALY gained if only direct costs were considered, and 'dominance' of the 
intervention if total costs were considered. Yet, regardless of decision makers' 
willingness to pay per QALY, the probability of the intervention being 
cost-effective was never above 90%.
CONCLUSIONS: In small primary care practices, 1 year of case management did not 
increase the number of QALYs but it did increase the number of DFDs. The 
intervention was likely to be cost-effective.

Facilitation, reduced competition or increased competition can arise in mixed 
stands and become essential to the performance of these stands when compared to 
pure stands. Facilitation and over-yielding are widely held to prevail on poor 
sites, whereas neutral interactions or competition, leading to under-yielding of 
mixed versus pure stands, can occur on fertile sites. While previous studies 
have focused on the spatial variation of mixing effects, we examine the temporal 
variation of facilitation and competition and its effect on growth. The study is 
based on tree ring measurement on cores from increment borings from 559 trees of 
Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica [L.]) 
and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) in southern Germany, half of 
which were in pure stands and half in adjacent mixed stands. Mean basal area 
growth indices were calculated from tree ring measurements for pure and mixed 
stands for every species and site. The temporal variation, with positive 
correlations between species-specific growth indices during periods of low 
growth and neutral or negative correlations during periods of high growth, is 
more distinct in mixed than in neighbouring pure stands. We provide evidence 
that years with low growth trigger over-yielding of trees in mixed as opposed to 
pure stands, while years with high growth lead to under-yielding. We discuss the 
relevance of the results in terms of advancing our understanding and modelling 
of mixed stands, extension of the stress gradient hypothesis, and the 
performance of mixed versus pure stands in the face of climate change.

Pathomorphometry of ruptured intracranial vertebral arterial dissection: 
adventitial rupture, dilated lesion, intimal tear, and medial defect.

OBJECT: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to ruptured intracranial vertebral 
artery (VA) dissection is a life-threatening disease. Angiographic and 
symptomatic prognostic factors for rupture and rerupture have been investigated, 
but the pathological characteristics have not been fully investigated. The 
authors aimed to investigate these features by performing a pathomorphometic 
study of ruptured intracranial VA dissections.
METHODS: This study included 50 administrative autopsy cases of fatal SAH due to 
ruptured intracranial VA dissection among 517 fatal nontraumatic cases of SAH 
occurring between March 2003 and May 2011. Pathomorphometry was performed using 
serial 5-μm histological cross-sections with elastica van Gieson staining from 
each 0.2-mm segment around the ruptured intracranial VA. The longitudinal 
lengths of 4 types of vascular lesions-adventitial ruptures, dilated lesions 
where the internal elastic lamina (IEL) was ruptured with adventitial extension, 
intimal tears where the IEL was ruptured, and medial defects-were calculated 
based on the numbers of the slides in which these lesions were continuously 
detected (minimum 2 adjoining slides). The distance from the vertebrobasilar 
junction to the center of adventitial rupture was also calculated in 37 cases.
RESULTS: All cases showed one adventitial rupture with a mean length of about 
1.9±1.1 mm. The center of the adventitial rupture was located 5.0-26.8 mm (mean 
14.6±5.5 mm) from the intracranial VA bifurcation. Adventitial ruptures existed 
in the centers of dilated lesions, where the adventitia was highly extended. 
Other vascular lesions were serially observed surrounding the adventitial 
rupture. The mean lengths of dilated lesions, intimal tears, and medial defects 
were 9.4±4.8 mm, 13.2±6.3 mm, and 15.6±7.2 mm, respectively. The lengths between 
proximal lesions and distal lesions from the center of the adventitial rupture 
for both medial defects and intimal tears were significantly longer at proximal 
lesions than at distal ones (chi-square test, p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Every ruptured intracranial VA dissection has a single point of 
adventitial rupture where the adventitia was maximally extended, so dilation 
appears to be a valuable predictive factor for hemorrhagic intracranial VA 
dissections. The adventitial ruptures were as small as 2 mm in length, and 
clinically detectable dilated lesions were about 9 mm in length. However, 
vascular vulnerability caused by IEL ruptures and medial defects existed more 
widely across a length of VA of 1.3-1.5 cm. Comparatively broader protection of 
the intracranial VA than the clinically detected area of dissection might be 
desirable to prevent rebleeding. Broader protection of proximal lesions than 
distal lesions might be effective from the viewpoint of site distribution of 
vascular lesions and blood flow alteration to the pseudolumen caused by the 
dissecting hematoma. Medial defects are the most widely seen lesions among the 4 
types of vascular lesions studied. Medial degenerative disease, known as 
segmental arterial mediolysis, is suspected in the pathogenesis of intracranial 
VA dissections.

[Is it useful to quit smoking in the elderly population? Yes! Smoking cessation 
is beneficial at any age].

Smoking prevalence remains high among the elderly. Mortality of older smokers is 
multiplied by 2 to 3 compared to subjects who had never smoked and 70 % of 
smoking-related deaths occur beyond 60 years. Smoking is a risk factor for 
premature death, including among older subjects, with a loss of at least 10 
years of life expectancy compared to non-smokers. Smoking cessation increases 
life expectancy even in patients over 60 years, with a relative reduction in the 
risk of death of about 20 to 30 %, including beyond 80 years. The fastest and 
most important benefit is cardiovascular, particularly in the context of 
secondary prevention. This benefit increases with time since smoking cessation, 
hence the importance of the earliest possible withdrawal. Smoking cessation is 
not more difficult than in young subjects and the different therapeutic 
approaches have the same efficacy as in younger. It is essential to stop smoking 
as soon as possible, but there is no age beyond which it is totally unnecessary.

Much of the change being sought in the United State's health-care system is 
predicated on improving value. Value is most simply defined as quality divided 
by cost, and physicians increasingly rely on the quality-adjusted life year as 
the numerical measure to justify their services. However, there are many other 
definitions of value being advocated by various stakeholders in the health-care 
reform effort. Incentive programs and pilot studies implemented by private and 
public payers are steering much of the current change. Expanding our 
understanding of how value is defined by health-care economists and policy 
makers can help spine providers navigate the evolving health-care landscape.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine the minimum mortality reduction that helicopter 
emergency medical services (EMS) should provide relative to ground EMS for the 
scene transport of trauma victims to offset higher costs, inherent transport 
risks, and inevitable overtriage of patients with minor injury.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare the costs and 
outcomes of helicopter versus ground EMS transport to a trauma center from a 
societal perspective during a patient's lifetime. We determined the mortality 
reduction needed to make helicopter transport cost less than $100,000 and 
$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with ground EMS. Model 
inputs were derived from the National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma, 
National Trauma Data Bank, Medicare reimbursements, and literature. We assessed 
robustness with probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Helicopter EMS must provide a minimum of a 15% relative risk reduction 
in mortality (1.3 lives saved/100 patients with the mean characteristics of the 
National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma cohort) to cost less than 
$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained and a reduction of at least 30% 
(3.3 lives saved/100 patients) to cost less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year. Helicopter EMS becomes more cost-effective with significant 
reductions in patients with minor injury who are triaged to air transport or if 
long-term disability outcomes are improved.
CONCLUSION: Helicopter EMS needs to provide at least a 15% mortality reduction 
or a measurable improvement in long-term disability to compare favorably with 
other interventions considered cost-effective. Given current evidence, it is not 
clear that helicopter EMS achieves this mortality or disability reduction. 
Reducing overtriage of patients with minor injury to helicopter EMS would 
improve its cost-effectiveness.

beliefs and assessed health indices.

Agriculture, The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad and 
Tobago. patricia.dyett@sta.uwi.edu

This study aimed to investigate health belief as a major motive for diet and 
lifestyle behaviors of 100 vegans in the United States; and to determine 
congruence with selected health and nutrition outcomes. Response data from an 
administered questionnaire was analyzed. Statistical analyses determined the 
most common factors influencing diet choice; the number of vegans practicing 
particular lifestyle behaviors; body mass index; and prevalence of self-reported 
chronic disease diagnoses. Nutrient intakes were analyzed and assessed against 
Dietary Reference Intakes. Health was the most reported reason for diet choice 
(47%). In the health belief, animal welfare, and religious/other motive 
categories, low percentages of chronic disease diagnoses were reported: 27%, 
11%, and 15%, respectively. There were no significant differences in health 
behaviors and indices among vegan motive categories, except for product fat 
content choices. Within the entire study population, health-related vegan motive 
coincided with regular exercise; 71% normal BMI (mean=22.6); minimal alcohol and 
smoking practices; frequently consumed vegetables, nuts, and grains; healthy 
choices in meal types, cooking methods, and low-fat product consumption; and 
adequate intakes for most protective nutrients when compared to reference 
values. But incongruence was found with 0% intake adequacy for vitamin D; and 
observation of excessive sodium use.

Visual scene perception in navigating wood ants.

Lent DD(1), Graham P, Collett TS.

Ants, like honeybees, can set their travel direction along foraging routes using 
just the surrounding visual panorama. This ability gives us a way to explore how 
visual scenes are perceived. By training wood ants to follow a path in an 
artificial scene and then examining their path within transformed scenes, we 
identify several perceptual operations that contribute to the ants' choice of 
direction. The first is a novel extension to the known ability of insects to 
compute the "center of mass" of large shapes: ants learn a desired heading 
toward a point on a distant shape as the proportion of the shape that lies to 
the left and right of the aiming point--the 'fractional position of mass' (FPM). 
The second operation, the extraction of local visual features like oriented 
edges, is familiar from studies of shape perception. Ants may use such features 
for guidance by keeping them in desired retinal locations. Third, ants exhibit 
segmentation. They compute the learned FPM over the whole of a simple scene, but 
over a segmented region of a complex scene. We suggest how the three operations 
may combine to provide efficient directional guidance.

This study investigates the effect of early-life exposure to malaria on disease 
and work level in old age over the past one and a half centuries. Using 
longitudinal lifetime records of Union Army veterans, I first estimate that 
exposure to a malarial environment in early life (c.1840) substantially 
increased the likelihood of having various chronic diseases and not working in 
old age (c.1900). Second, from data on US cohorts born between 1891 and 1960, I 
find that those exposed to a higher level of the anti-malaria campaign, which 
began in 1921, had lower levels of work disability in old age. Third, I seek the 
same implications for the modern period by linking WHO's country statistics on 
DALYs among older populations in 2004 to country-level malaria risk in 
pre-eradication era. In the paper, I discuss possible mechanisms and propose the 
significance of malaria eradication and early-life conditions from a long-term 
perspective.

Focus on the heart: alcohol consumption, HIV infection, and cardiovascular 
disease.

With the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy, people infected with HIV 
have a longer life expectancy and, consequently, are likely to develop other 
chronic conditions also found in noninfected people, including cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). Alcohol consumption, which is common among HIV-infected people, 
may influence the risk of CVD. In noninfected adults, moderate alcohol 
consumption can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), heart attacks, 
and the most common type of stroke, whereas heavy drinking increases the risk of 
these cardiovascular events. These relationships can be partially explained by 
alcohol's effects on various risk factors for CVD, including cholesterol and 
other lipid levels, diabetes, or blood pressure. In HIV-infected people, both 
the infection itself and its treatment using combination antiretroviral therapy 
may contribute to an increased risk of CVD by altering blood lipid levels, 
inducing inflammation, and impacting blood-clotting processes, all of which can 
enhance CVD risk. Coinfection with the hepatitis C virus also may exacerbate CVD 
risk. Excessive alcohol use can further enhance CVD risk in HIV-infected people 
through either of the mechanisms described above. In addition, excessive alcohol 
use (as well as HIV infection) promote microbial translocation, the leaking of 
bacteria or bacterial products from the intestine into the blood stream, where 
they can induce inflammatory and immune reactions that damage the cardiovascular 
system.

As patient with cancer live longer, spine metastasis is a growing problem. 
Untreated, it can cause pain, instability and neurologic deficit, which can 
severely alter the patient's ability and quality of life. When the diagnosis is 
established, scoring systems help the physician to best define the objective of 
treatment by evaluating the life expectancy. Except in rare circumstances, 
treatment is palliative. Over the past 2 decades, remarkable evolution in 
surgical techniques provided to patients valuable therapeutic options to perform 
circumferential decompression and stabilization of the affected level. More 
recently, minimally invasive techniques allowed a significant reduction of 
morbidity. The parallel development of stereotactic radiosurgery offers new 
therapeutic options in particular for patients ineligible for surgery.

Healthy Ageing Research; University of Birmingham; Birmingham, UK.

With a falling birth rate and increasing life expectancy we are experiencing 
dramatic demographic changes that result in an ever ageing population. Ageing is 
accompanied by increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections 
indicative of a decline in immunity, termed immunesenescence. Immunesenescence 
also has implications for vaccination programmes and there is clear evidence 
that the decline in adaptive immunity results in dramatically reduced vaccine 
responses and vaccine longevity in older adults. This review summarises some of 
the key changes in the adaptive immune response that change with age and 
suggests approaches that could be used to try and improve vaccine responses in 
older adults.
