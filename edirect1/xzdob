OBJECTIVES: To analyze the behavior of mortality from diabetes mellitus (DM) for 
both sexes in Mexico from 1998 to 2018, and its impact on life expectancy (LE) 
from 60 to 85 years of age in the three-year periods 1998-2000 and 2016-2018, 
compared with other causes of death, as well as to determine the loss of years 
of life expectancy associated with DM in each three-year period.
METHODS: The current study is observational and descriptive. Age-adjusted rates 
of mortality from DM were calculated for each sex from 1998 to 2018. 
Sex-specific life tables were constructed for 1998-2000 and 2016-2018, and both 
LE between 60 and 85 years, and years of life expectancy lost (YLELL) due to DM 
and selected causes between both ages were calculated.
RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2018, the adjusted DM-resulting male mortality rate 
grew 55% in the population aged 60 and over, while the female mortality rate 
grew 20%. Between 1998-2000 and 2016-2018, male LE for 60-85 age group decreased 
0.22 years, while female LE increased 0.24. In 2016-2018, DM was responsible for 
1.30 YLEL among men of 60 to 85 years (19% of the total YLEL), and 1.24 YLEL for 
women (24% of the total), more than the other causes analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in mortality from DM has substantially contributed 
both to reduce LE of older adult men, and to slow the increase of LE among women 
aged 60 years and older so far this century. Thus, preventive policies should be 
implemented since early ages to reduce the high levels of overweight and obesity 
in the country and, therefore, the significant population ratio suffering from 
DM.

OBJETIVOS: Analizar el comportamiento de la mortalidad por diabetes mellitus 
(DM) para ambos sexos en México entre 1998 y 2018 y su impacto sobre la 
esperanza de vida (EV) entre los 60 y 85 años de edad en los trienios 1998–2000 
y 2016–2018 – en comparación con otras causas de muerte –, así como determinar 
la pérdida de años de esperanza de vida asociados a la DM en cada trienio.
MÉTODOS: El presente estudio es observacional y descriptivo. Se calcularon tasas 
de mortalidad por DM ajustadas por edad para cada sexo entre 1998 y 2018. Se 
construyeron tablas de vida por sexo para 1998–2000 y 2016–2018 y se calculó 
tanto la EV entre 60 y 85 años, como los años de esperanza de vida perdidos 
(AEVP) por DM, y causas seleccionadas, entre ambas edades.
RESULTADOS: Entre 1998 y 2018 la tasa ajustada de mortalidad masculina por DM 
creció 55% en la población de 60 y más, y la femenina 20%. Entre 1998–2000 y 
2016–2018, la EV masculina entre 60 y 85 años se redujo 0,22 años, en tanto la 
femenina aumentó 0,24. En 2016–2018 la DM fue responsable, para los hombres, de 
1,30 AEVP entre 60 y 85 años, (19% del total de AEVP) y para las mujeres 1,24 
AEVP (24% del total), más que el resto de causas analizadas.
CONCLUSIONES: El incremento de la mortalidad por DM ha contribuido de manera 
sustancial tanto a reducir la EV de los hombres adultos mayores, como a 
ralentizar el aumento de la EV de las mujeres de 60 años y más en lo que va de 
siglo. Así, resulta necesario implementar políticas preventivas desde edades 
tempranas que permitan reducir los altos niveles de sobrepeso y obesidad 
existentes en el país, y por ende, la notable proporción de población que padece 
DM.

University, Wroclaw, Poland.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been an increase of aging population with 
longer life expectancy in females. This study aims to compare some oral health 
parameters and quality of life in the elderly.
METHODS: The survey involved 500 urban residents (Wroclaw, Poland) aged 65 and 
older, of both gender. Socio-demografic data were assessed by self-reported 
questionnaire. Clinical examination included oral health assessment by the World 
Health Organization criteria with extension and oral dryness (Chalacombe scale). 
Quality of Life (QoL) was evaluated using Euro-Quality of Life, Oral Health 
Impact Profile-14 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, which were validated for 
the Polish population. The relationship strength between psychometric scale 
scores and sociodemographic and clinical factors was determined by calculating 
Spearman's linear correlation coefficient values and regression coefficient 
values.
RESULTS: There was no gender-wise differences in oral health parameters, except 
for a higher number of decayed teeth in males (DT 1.9±3.2 vs 1.2±2.4; p = 0.34). 
Oral dryness was diagnosed significantly more frequently in females then males 
(36.9% vs. 25.5%; p = 0.076). The males were significantly more likely to have 
high treatment needs (36.1% vs. 26.9%; p = 0.032) and they required urgent 
dental treatment (7.2% vs. 2.8%; p = 0.022). There were no significant 
differences in terms of QoL evaluated by EQ-5D, EQ-5D VAS or OHIP-14 
questionnaires between males and females (0.832±0.194 vs 0.855±0.197, 67.9±10.9 
vs 66.1±18.6, 7.2±12.9 vs 8.5±14.0, respectively; p > 0.05). However, females 
presented the higher severity of depressive symptoms measured by the PHQ-9 
questionnaire (4.0±4.1 vs. 2.8±3.8; p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the independent predictors which 
significantly affect the high QoL scores on the EQ-5D scale were found to be 
female gender, age below 75, high or middle income, independence in daily life, 
a low number of comorbidities, lack of oral treatment needs.

Estimating the infant mortality rate from DHS birth histories in the presence of 
age heaping.

BACKGROUND: The infant mortality rate (IMR) is a critical indicator of 
population health, but its measurement is subject to response bias in countries 
without complete vital registration systems who rely instead on birth histories 
collected via sample surveys. One of the most salient bias is the fact that 
child deaths in these birth histories tend to be reported with a large amount of 
heaping at age 12 months. Because of this issue, analysts and international 
agencies do not directly use IMR estimates based on surveys such as Demographic 
and Health Surveys (DHS); they rely instead on mortality models such as model 
life tables. The use of model life tables in this context, however, is 
arbitrary, and the extent to which this approach appropriately addresses bias in 
DHS-based IMR estimates remains unclear. This hinders our ability to monitor IMR 
levels and trends in low-and middle-income countries. The objective of this 
study is to evaluate age heaping bias in DHS-based IMR estimates and propose an 
improved method for adjusting this bias.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our method relies on a recently-developed log-quadratic 
model that can predict age-specific mortality by detailed age between 0 and 5. 
The model's coefficients were derived from a newly constituted database, the 
Under-5 Mortality Database (U5MD), that represents the mortality experience of 
countries with high-quality vital registration data. We applied this model to 
204 DHS surveys, and compared unadjusted IMR values to IMR values adjusted with 
the log-quadratic model as well as with the classic model life table approach. 
Results show that contrary to existing knowledge, age heaping at age 12 months 
rarely generates a large amount of bias in IMR estimates. In most cases, the 
unadjusted IMR values were not deviating by more than +/- 5% from the adjusted 
values. The model life table approach, by contrast, introduced an unwarranted, 
downward bias in adjusted IMR values. We also found that two regions, 
Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, present age patterns of under-5 mortality 
that strongly depart from the experience represented in the U5MD. For these 
countries, neither the existing model life tables nor the log-quadratic model 
can produce empirically-supported IMR adjustments.
CONCLUSIONS: Age heaping at age 12 months produces a smaller amount of bias in 
DHS-based IMR estimates than previously thought. If a large amount of age 
heaping is present in a survey, the log-quadratic model allows users to 
evaluate, and whenever necessary, adjust IMR estimates in a way that is more 
informed by the local mortality pattern than existing approaches. Future 
research should be devoted to understanding why Sub-Saharan African and South 
Asian countries have such distinct age patterns of under-five mortality.

BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that less emotionally stable, less 
conscientious, less extraverted, and less agreeable women tend to suffer from 
higher fear of childbirth and experience their delivery as worse. Moreover, 
there is evidence that birth characteristics and unexpected incidents during 
delivery may impact women's birth experiences. However, it remains unknown 
whether the role of personality in subjective birth experiences varies between 
women with different birth characteristics.
METHODS: We used data from the Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant 
Development (MARI) Study, a regional-epidemiological study among pregnant women, 
who were prospectively followed up in multiple waves across the peripartum 
period. During pregnancy, personality was assessed with the short version of the 
Big Five Inventory. The Wijma Delivery Expectancy/ Experience Questionnaire was 
used to measure fear of childbirth (version A) during pregnancy and subjective 
birth experiences (version B) within the first 10 days after delivery.
RESULTS: Linear regressions revealed that lower levels of emotional stability, 
agreeableness, and extraversion predicted higher fear of childbirth during 
pregnancy. Moreover, personality affected subjective birth experiences 
especially in women with specific birth characteristics: Lower emotional 
stability predicted worse subjective birth experiences in women with (vs. 
without) a preterm delivery, and higher conscientiousness predicted worse 
subjective birth experiences in women with an emergency cesarean section (vs. 
spontaneous delivery). Subjective birth experiences were also worse in less 
emotionally stable and less open women with (general) anesthesia (vs. no 
anesthesia) during delivery. Finally, higher emotional stability predicted a 
subjective birth experience that was worse than expected, particularly in 
multiparous women and women without anesthesia during delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that less emotionally stable, less 
conscientious, and less open women tend to experience their delivery as worse 
particularly in case of unexpected incidents (i.e., preterm delivery, emergency 
cesarean section, and necessity of anesthetics) and might thus profit from early 
targeted interventions.

Stocking rate and rangeland area are key variables to provide the livelihood of 
herders in different climatic zones. To evaluate the economic and ecological 
management of pastoral units, this study aims to determine the optimal economic 
size of pastoral units for livestock grazing use considering the ecological 
capacity of semi-arid rangelands in different climatic scenarios. Therefore, 12 
pastoral units (an area of 47,355 ha) were selected in two climatic zones 
(summer and winter rangelands) in the Kalat region of Razavi Khorasan Province, 
Iran. By measuring forage production, carrying capacity was calculated. Based on 
the results, the costs of traditional livestock management in winter rangelands 
are higher than those of summer rangelands. Moreover, the current size of the 
assigned rangeland, especially the summer rangeland, is lower than that of the 
economic justification. The results emphasize that rangeland-based livestock 
husbandry cannot create a good livelihood for herders in the region, and it is 
necessary to pay special attention to other services and aspects, despite the 
existing ecological and socio-economic complexities. In this regard, providing 
multi-purpose rangeland use and useable technologies to better manage these 
areas is necessary to increase per capita household income and reduce the 
stocking rate in the region's rangelands. Ultimately, both increasing the level 
of available rangelands and reducing costs by applying new technology are 
required, as is the economic consideration of pastoral units by using rangelands 
for multiple purposes.

PURPOSE: In the Phase III COV-BARRIER (Efficacy and Safety of Baricitinib for 
the Treatment of Hospitalised Adults With COVID-19) trial, treatment with 
baricitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor, in addition to 
standard of care (SOC), was associated with significantly reduced mortality over 
28 days in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), with 
a safety profile similar to that of SOC alone. This study assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of baricitinib + SOC versus SOC alone (which included 
systemic corticosteroids and remdesivir) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 
in the United States.
METHODS: An economic model was developed to simulate inpatients' stay, discharge 
to postacute care, and recovery. Costs modeled included payor costs, hospital 
costs, and indirect costs. Benefits modeled included life-years (LYs) gained, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, deaths avoided, and use of 
mechanical ventilation avoided. The primary analysis was performed from a payor 
perspective over a lifetime horizon; a secondary analysis was performed from a 
hospital perspective. The base-case analysis modeled the numeric differences in 
treatment effectiveness observed in the COV-BARRIER trial. Scenario analyses 
were also performed in which the clinical benefit of baricitinib was limited to 
the statistically significant reduction in mortality demonstrated in the trial.
FINDINGS: In the base-case payor perspective model, an incremental total cost of 
17,276 US dollars (USD), total QALYs gained of 0.6703, and total LYs gained of 
0.837 were found with baricitinib + SOC compared with SOC alone. With the 
addition of baricitinib, survival was increased by 5.1% and the use of 
mechanical ventilation was reduced by 1.6%. The base-case incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were 25,774 USD/QALY gained and 20,638 USD/LY gained; 
a "mortality-only" scenario analysis yielded similar results of 26,862 USD/QALY 
gained and 21,433 USD/LY gained. From the hospital perspective, combination 
treatment with baricitinib + SOC was more effective and less costly than was SOC 
alone in the base case, with an incremental cost of 38,964 USD per death avoided 
in the mortality-only scenario.
IMPLICATIONS: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States, the 
addition of baricitinib to SOC was cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness was 
demonstrated from both the payor and the hospital perspectives. These findings 
were robust to sensitivity analysis and to conservative assumptions limiting the 
clinical benefits of baricitinib to the statistically significant reduction in 
mortality demonstrated in the COV-BARRIER trial.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the changes in life expectancy and years of life lost in 
2020 associated with the covid-19 pandemic.
DESIGN: Time series analysis.
SETTING: 37 upper-middle and high income countries or regions with reliable and 
complete mortality data.
PARTICIPANTS: Annual all cause mortality data from the Human Mortality Database 
for 2005-20, harmonised and disaggregated by age and sex.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in life expectancy was estimated as the 
difference between observed and expected life expectancy in 2020 using the 
Lee-Carter model. Excess years of life lost were estimated as the difference 
between the observed and expected years of life lost in 2020 using the World 
Health Organization standard life table.
RESULTS: Reduction in life expectancy in men and women was observed in all the 
countries studied except New Zealand, Taiwan, and Norway, where there was a gain 
in life expectancy in 2020. No evidence was found of a change in life expectancy 
in Denmark, Iceland, and South Korea. The highest reduction in life expectancy 
was observed in Russia (men: -2.33, 95% confidence interval -2.50 to -2.17; 
women: -2.14, -2.25 to -2.03), the United States (men: -2.27, -2.39 to -2.15; 
women: -1.61, -1.70 to -1.51), Bulgaria (men: -1.96, -2.11 to -1.81; women: 
-1.37, -1.74 to -1.01), Lithuania (men: -1.83, -2.07 to -1.59; women: -1.21, 
-1.36 to -1.05), Chile (men: -1.64, -1.97 to -1.32; women: -0.88, -1.28 to 
-0.50), and Spain (men: -1.35, -1.53 to -1.18; women: -1.13, -1.37 to -0.90). 
Years of life lost in 2020 were higher than expected in all countries except 
Taiwan, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and South Korea. In the remaining 
31 countries, more than 222 million years of life were lost in 2020, which is 
28.1 million (95% confidence interval 26.8m to 29.5m) years of life lost more 
than expected (17.3 million (16.8m to 17.8m) in men and 10.8 million (10.4m to 
11.3m) in women). The highest excess years of life lost per 100 000 population 
were observed in Bulgaria (men: 7260, 95% confidence interval 6820 to 7710; 
women: 3730, 2740 to 4730), Russia (men: 7020, 6550 to 7480; women: 4760, 4530 
to 4990), Lithuania (men: 5430, 4750 to 6070; women: 2640, 2310 to 2980), the US 
(men: 4350, 4170 to 4530; women: 2430, 2320 to 2550), Poland (men: 3830, 3540 to 
4120; women: 1830, 1630 to 2040), and Hungary (men: 2770, 2490 to 3040; women: 
1920, 1590 to 2240). The excess years of life lost were relatively low in people 
younger than 65 years, except in Russia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, and the US where 
the excess years of life lost was >2000 per 100 000.
CONCLUSION: More than 28 million excess years of life were lost in 2020 in 31 
countries, with a higher rate in men than women. Excess years of life lost 
associated with the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 were more than five times higher 
than those associated with the seasonal influenza epidemic in 2015.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of custom-made insoles compared 
with general practitioner (GP)-led usual care after 26 weeks of follow-up in 
individuals with plantar heel pain (PHP) from a societal perspective.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis of a double-blinded randomised controlled 
trial.
SETTING: General practice in the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: 116 participants with PHP for at least 2 weeks, aged 18-65 years 
and presenting to the GP.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to GP-led usual care (n=46) or 
referral to a podiatrist for treatment with a custom-made insole (n=70). 
Participant randomised to a sham insole (n=69) were excluded from this analysis.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Outcomes comprised pain during rest and 
activity, and quality of life. Costs included healthcare and lost productivity 
costs. Statistical uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping and presented 
using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: Participants in the custom-made insole group experienced statistically 
significant more pain during activity at 26 weeks than participants in the usual 
care group (overall effect 1.06; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.75). There were no significant 
differences between groups in other outcomes. Total societal costs in the 
custom-made insole group were non-significantly higher than in the usual care 
group (mean difference €376; 95% CI -€1775 to €2038). The intervention with 
custom-made insoles was dominated by usual care by the GP (ie, more expensive 
and less effective) for pain during activity and quality of life outcomes. For 
the outcome pain at rest, the intervention was more expensive and more effective 
than usual care. However, the maximum probability of cost-effectiveness was only 
0.59 at very high ceiling ratios.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that that custom-made insoles are not 
cost-effective in comparison with GP-led usual care. Clinicians should be 
reserved in prescribing custom-made insoles for PHP as a primary intervention.

INTRODUCTION: People with serious mental illness (SMI), which includes people 
with diagnoses of schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorders, face significant 
health inequality. This includes a life expectancy reduced by 15-20 years mostly 
due to premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with the general 
population. Excess weight gain and related comorbidities are preventable risk 
factors for CVD. To improve the understanding and management of CVD in people 
with SMI, we will examine the association between SMI and: (1) weight change; 
(2) cardio-metabolic risk factors for CVD; and (3) incidence of and mortality 
from CVD. We will also (4) examine the incidence of referral to weight 
management services for people with SMI compared with people without SMI.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this retrospective cohort study, we will link general 
practice records from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum database. 
We will establish a cohort of patients diagnosed with SMI between 1998 and 2020 
who are matched with up to four controls on age, sex, general practice and 
calendar year. We will use multivariable mixed-effects linear regression models 
and Cox proportional hazard models with sequential adjustment for potential 
confounders identified by separate directed acyclic graphs.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been reviewed and approved by the 
Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency database research. The results will be published in a 
peer-reviewed journal.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the concordance among urologists' judgment of health 
quartiles for patients with localized prostate cancer, and compared the life 
expectancy (LE) and ensuing treatment recommendations when following National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines based on actuarial life tables 
versus the Kent model, a validated LE prediction model.
METHODS: NCCN suggests using actuarial life tables and relying on surgeon 
assessment of patient health to increase (for the best quartile) or decrease 
(for the worst quartile) LE by 50%. Eleven urologic surgeons allocated quartile 
of health and recommended treatments for ten patient vignettes. The 10-year 
survival probability was calculated using the Kent model and compared to the 
life-table estimate based on health quartile by surgeon consensus.
RESULTS: Surgeon assessment agreed with the presumed true quartile of health 
based on a validated model in 41% of cases. For no case did three-quarters of 
surgeons assign health quartile correctly; in half of cases, <50% of surgeons 
assigned the correct quartile. The NCCN comorbidity-adjusted LE estimates 
underestimated risk of death in the best health quartile and overestimated risk 
of death in the worst health quartile, compared to the Kent model. Patients with 
LE > 10 years on NCCN estimation were recommended more frequently for surgery 
(81%) and those with ≤10 years estimated LE were more commonly recommended for 
radiation (57%) or observation (29%).
CONCLUSIONS: A method based on physician-assessed health quartiles for LE 
estimation, as suggested by the NCCN guidelines, appears too crude to be used in 
the treatment counseling of men with localized prostate cancer, as compared to a 
validated prediction model, such as the Kent model.

The elderly population, with those individuals above the age of 60 years, is 
increasing exponentially, attributable to higher life expectancy as a result of 
improved health care, socioeconomic level, and quality of life. As they grow 
older (>80 years), it becomes difficult to manage their basic needs and daily 
living. A report on Decade of Healthy Ageing estimates that 14% of people aged 
60 years and above cannot meet their basic daily needs which include the ability 
to manage finances. Some elderly people depend on others to manage finances 
because of their inability to make decisions resulting in conflicts and 
communication problems between siblings and other members of the family and 
lodging of civil lawsuits in India's joint family unit. So, decision-making is 
an important area to assess in the elderly people, given its clinical, legal, 
and ethical aspects. Courts of law can refer to older persons for assessing 
their capacity to manage finances, though there are no structured clinical 
procedures to assess it in India. This article evaluates existing methods around 
the world, discusses the challenges associated with the assessment, and provides 
clinicians with guidance on assessing financial capacity from an Indian 
perspective.

Metabolic disturbances and obesity are major cardiovascular risk factors in 
patients with schizophrenia, resulting in a higher mortality rate and shorter 
life expectancy compared with those in the general population. Although 
schizophrenia and metabolic disturbances may share certain genetic or 
pathobiological risks, antipsychotics, particularly those of second generation, 
may further increase the risk of weight gain and metabolic disturbances in 
patients with schizophrenia. This review included articles on weight gain and 
metabolic disturbances related to antipsychotics and their mechanisms, 
monitoring guidelines, and interventions. Nearly all antipsychotics are 
associated with weight gain, but the degree of the weight gain varies 
considerably. Although certain neurotransmitter receptor-binding affinities and 
hormones are correlated with weight gain and specific metabolic abnormalities, 
the precise mechanisms underlying antipsychotic-induced weight gain and 
metabolic disturbances remain unclear. Emerging evidence indicates the role of 
genetic polymorphisms associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain and 
antipsychotic-induced metabolic disturbances. Although many guidelines for 
screening and monitoring antipsychotic-induced metabolic disturbances have been 
developed, they are not routinely implemented in clinical care. Numerous studies 
have also investigated strategies for managing antipsychotic-induced metabolic 
disturbances. Thus, patients and their caregivers must be educated and motivated 
to pursue a healthier life through smoking cessation and dietary and physical 
activity programs. If lifestyle intervention fails, switching to another 
antipsychotic drug with a lower metabolic risk or adding adjunctive medication 
to mitigate weight gain should be considered. Antipsychotic medications are 
essential for schizophrenia treatment, hence clinicians should monitor and 
manage the resulting weight gain and metabolic disturbances.

Does the Attention of the Chinese Government Influence Chinese Nutrition, 
Exercise, and Health? Based on the Content Analysis of the Central Government 
Work Reports From 1978 to 2020.

The attention of the Chinese government on nutrition, exercise, and health 
refers to the attention degree of the Central Government to the nutrition, 
exercise, and health of Chinese nationals and reflects whether Central 
Government attach importance to Chinese nationals' nutrition, exercise and 
health or not and the distribution of resources, which influence the physical 
quality and health level of Chinese nationals. Based on the attention theory and 
attention distribution proposed by Herbert Simon, Dai Kai, et al., this study 
took 43 Central Government Work Reports from 1978 to 2020 as research samples, 
used literature reviews, and textual analysis methods, and applied the Nvivo12.0 
software to conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses about the contents of 
the Central Government Work Report concerning the nutrition, exercise, and 
health of Chinese nationals. This research found the following: (1) There has 
been a relatively huge overall change in the attention of the Central 
Government, that is, the level of attention, to the nutrition, exercise, and 
health of Chinese nationals from 1978 to 2020, and the policies related to 
nutrition, exercise and health of Chinese nationals issued by the Central 
Government have been growing faster. (2) The income level of the urban and rural 
residents, the total production of various types of food, dietary structure, the 
total number of medical and health institutions, the average life expectancy of 
the Chinese population, and the number of sports venues have been constantly 
increasing since the reform and opening up, which has effectively promoted the 
improvement of the nutrition, exercise and health level of Chinese nationals, 
and it cannot be achieved without the attention and support of the Central 
Government. However, the change in the lifestyle of Chinese nationals has led to 
the growth of the modern "Civilization Disease," which is also an important 
issue that the Central Government needs to handle urgently.

Communicating About Mortality in Health Decision Support: 'What and Why and 
When, and How and Where and Who'.

The Covid-19 pandemic has only accelerated the need and desire to deal more 
openly with mortality, because the effect on survival is central to the 
comprehensive assessment of harms and benefits needed to meet a 'reasonable 
patient' legal standard. Taking the view that this requirement is best met 
through a multi-criterial decision support tool, we offer our preferred answers 
to the questions of What should be communicated about mortality in the tool, and 
How, given preferred answers to Who for, Who by, Why, When, and Where. Summary 
measures, including unrestricted Life Expectancy and Restricted Mean Survival 
Time are found to be reductionist and relative, and not as easy to understand 
and communicate as often asserted. Full lifetime absolute survival curves should 
be presented, even if they cannot be 'evidence-based' beyond trial follow-up 
limits, along with equivalent measures for other criteria in the (necessarily) 
multi-criterial decision. A decision support tool should relieve the reasonable 
person of the resulting calculation burden.

Strengths of the heart: Stressors, gratitude, and mental health in single 
mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant economic, 
social, and mental health challenges for many parents. However, single mothers 
(who are typically both primary caregivers and wage earners for their families) 
may be especially vulnerable to stress and mental health problems during this 
crisis. Gratitude is strongly linked to positive emotions as well as mental 
health and has been shown to be amendable in interventions but has rarely been 
assessed in regard to parent well-being. In the present study, we assessed the 
longitudinal relations between life stressors and gratitude on single mothers' 
mental health (N = 200) prior to, and during, the pandemic using quantitative 
and qualitative data. We found that stressors contributed to poor mental health 
both concurrently and across time. However, T1 gratitude was associated with 
lower internalizing problems at T2 (controlling for prior internalizing 
problems). Qualitative interviews revealed both challenges and strengths of 
single mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that fostering 
gratitude in single mothers could have benefits for their mental health and 
well-being. Future research should test this in an intervention and further 
elucidate strength-based resources that single mothers utilize to assist them 
during challenging times, reduce stressors, and improve their mental health.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss the long-term view of treating and following 
pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) - with review of what can be done to prevent, monitor for, and 
treat complications of therapy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Pediatric, adolescent, and young adult oncology patients, 
including those with ALL, are living longer with higher overall survival rates 
as treatments and supportive care for these patients continue to improve. These 
patients are burdened by the risk of significant health and quality of life 
consequences as a result of their treatment.. For these patients, the late 
effects of treatment can be life-threatening, such as secondary cancers or 
cardiotoxicity, or life-altering with respect to quality of life. The goal of 
this paper is to review the current literature, research, and surveillance 
guidelines regarding the late effects of ALL therapy, to outline what can be 
done to mitigate the toxic effects of oncology treatment, and to extend life 
expectancy and improve quality of life for our patients. We review risk factors 
and interventions available to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease, 
secondary malignancies, endocrine complications (obesity, osteoporosis, 
infertility, and premature menopause), cognitive effects, and effects on 
functioning and mortality.

Topical Tacrolimus 0.1% for treatment of cutaneous microcystic lymphatic 
malformations.

Microcystic lymphatic malformations as described in the international literature 
form a subgroup of low-flow congenital vascular malformations (VM) resulting 
from irregular embryological development. Microcystic lesions normally manifest 
as an accumulation of lymph- and blood-filled vesicles that, when externalized, 
cause skin maceration with consequent pain and potential infection resulting in 
the impairment of the patient's quality of life. There is no consensus on a 
standardized algorithm nor clear guidelines for successful treatment of this 
type of lymphatic malformation, and treatment options employed often result in 
ambivalent and transient outcomes with a high rate of recurrence. The topical 
formulation of tacrolimus is a well-known FDAapproved anti-T cell agent that was 
recently identified as a potent activator of ALK1, which is involved in several 
processes and functions including angiogenesis. We investigated if topical 
administration of tacrolimus may be an effective therapy for directly targeting 
cutaneous microcystic lymphatic malformations as a complement to systemic 
treatment. The study enrolled four patients with cutaneous microcystic lymphatic 
malformations: three male (ages: 13,15,18) and one female (age: 30). Two of the 
patients presented lesions on their backs, one patient on the left hand and one 
on the left lower limb. All four patients received treatment with topical 
tacrolimus 0.1% twice a day for 10 weeks on a previously selected area for 
application. Weekly clinical follow-ups were conducted along with close 
physician-patient contact. All patients displayed a satisfactory response after 
treatment. Lymphorrhea and bleeding were stopped in all cases and the esthetic 
aspect of lesions improved in two patients. To date, all patients presented no 
clinically significant changes to the size or extension of the lesion. Topical 
tacrolimus treatment is a promising and reasonable option for microcystic 
lymphatic malformations. Our results encourage further exploration in larger 
populations with the consideration that it is a safe and effective alternative 
or complementary therapy to systemic treatment.

Interleukin-21 (IL-21) has exhibited anti-tumor activity in preclinical and 
clinical studies; however, its modest efficacy and short half-time has limited 
its therapeutic utility as a monotherapy. Therefore, we engineered a fusion 
protein (IL-21-αHSA) in which a nanobody targeting human serum albumin (HSA) was 
fused to the C-terminus of rhIL-21. The αHSA nanobody displayed broad species 
cross-reactivity and bound to a HSA epitope that does not overlap with the FcRn 
binding site, thus providing a strategic design for half-life extension. The 
IL-21-αHSA fusion protein showed increased stability compared to rhIL-21, while 
retaining its bioactivity in a liquid solution for at least 6 months. Moreover, 
IL-21-αHSA showed a dramatically extended half-life and prolonged exposure in 
cynomolgus monkeys, with the t1/2 and AUC nearly 10 and 50 times greater than 
that of rhIL-21, respectively. Furthermore, IL-21-αHSA displayed enhanced 
anti-tumor efficacy in two syngeneic mouse models. Notably, IL-21-αHSA increased 
the anti-tumor effect of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and T cell 
immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) blockades when used in combination, with 
a protection against tumor rechallenge, suggesting the formation of long-term 
anti-tumor memory response. KEGG analysis identified significantly enriched 
pathways associated with anti-tumor immune response, with increased expression 
of genes associated with CD8+ T and NK cell cytotoxicity. Overall, these data 
support further clinical evaluation of IL-21-αHSA as a monotherapy or in 
combination with immune checkpoint blockades.
