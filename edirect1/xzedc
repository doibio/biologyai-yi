proportions of national healthcare budgets. The relatively young field of 
longevity research, after accumulating insights into the mechanisms of aging and 
producing dramatic laboratory demonstrations of life extension in some 
organisms, is entering the translational phase. This phase, through clinical 
trials, will confirm or refute the "geroscience hypothesis" that drugs can 
change the trajectory of the processes of aging within cells, and ultimately in 
living humans. At the same time, traditional funding patterns do not favor such 
visionary "moonshot" research, which, despite the potential for ultimately 
providing benefits for everyone, offers little prospect for rapid return on 
investment and high probabilities for early phase failure. New radical funding 
strategies incentivizing innovation will have to be called into play.

Joint modeling of longitudinal rank and time-to-event data with random effects 
model using a Bayesian approach is presented. Accelerated failure time (AFT) 
models can be used for the analysis of time-to-event data to estimate the 
effects of covariates on acceleration/deceleration of the survival time. The 
parametric AFT models require determining the event time distribution. So, we 
suppose that the time variable is modeled with Weibull AFT distribution. In many 
real-life applications, it is difficult to determine the appropriate 
distribution. To avoid this restriction, several semiparametric AFT models were 
proposed, containing spline-based model. So, we propose a flexible extension of 
the accelerated failure time model. Furthermore, the usual joint linear model, a 
joint partially linear model, is also considered containing the nonlinear effect 
of time on the longitudinal rank responses and nonlinear and time-dependent 
effects of covariates on the hazard. Also, a Bayesian approach that yields 
Bayesian estimates of the model's parameters is used. Some simulation studies 
are conducted to estimate parameters of the considered models. The model is 
applied to a real brain tumor patient's data set that underwent surgery. The 
results of analyzing data are presented to represent the method.

INTRODUCTION: TKIs are paradigmatic in CML management and offer patients the 
prospect of a normal life expectancy. As a consequence, the focus of both the 
clinician and patient has shifted to considerations of quality of life, 
including the ability to parent children. Unfortunately, TKIs are teratogenic so 
that alternative treatment options may be required during pregnancy to 
adequately control disease and minimize risk.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we summarize and provide an overview of the 
literature on the management of CML in women of childbearing age. We discuss the 
various treatment options as well as their advantages, disadvantages, and safety 
considerations. We discuss CML in the context of: 1) planned pregnancies with 
CML; 2) unplanned pregnancies with CML; 3) CML diagnosed during pregnancy.
EXPERT OPINION: Confidence in managing pregnancy and CML continues to grow. In 
the majority of cases, with careful planning and counseling, no treatment is 
required and disease control can be safely regained after pregnancy ends. For 
those who require treatment, various options are available and there is growing 
evidence to suggest that some TKIs may be safe in the later stages of pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has revolutionized HIV treatment, increasing 
quality and life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH). However, the 
expansion of treatment has resulted in an increase in antiretroviral-resistant 
viruses, which can be an obstacle to maintenance of successful ART.
OBJECTIVES: This study analysed the genetic composition of the HIV near 
full-length genome (NFLG) from archived proviruses of PLWH under successful ART, 
and determined the presence/frequency of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and 
viral subtype.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six PLWH from Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and 40 from Rio 
Grande (RS) had proviral HIV NFLG PCR-amplified and ultradeep sequenced. The 
presence/frequency of DRMs were analysed in Geneious. Phylogenetic analyses were 
performed using PhyML and SimPlot.
RESULTS: All samples included in the study were sequenced and 69 (80.2%) had the 
HIV NFLG determined. RJ and RS showed a predominance of HIV subtypes B (78.3%) 
and C (67.5%), respectively. Overall, 168 DRMs were found in 63 (73.3%) samples, 
and 105 (62.5%) of them were minority variants. Among DRMs, 41 (39.0%) minority 
variants and 33 (52.4%) variants with frequency above 20.0% in the viral 
population were able to confer some degree of resistance to at least one drug in 
use by respective patients, yet no one showed signs of therapeutic failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributes to the understanding of the impact of DRMs on 
successful therapy and supports the sustainability of combinatorial ART, because 
all patients maintained their successful treatment despite the high prevalence 
of DRMs at low (62.5%) or high (37.5%) frequency.

BACKGROUND: 'Frailty' has no consensual definition till date, although the term 
occupies a pivotal role in geriatric medicine. A bibliometric analysis of the 
literature serves to capture the keyword cooccurrences and linkages, 
co-citations, author collaborations, research trends and to present the extant 
research in a nutshell.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the usage of frailty, its domains in medical research and 
the evolution of the term to other disciplines through systematic mapping by 
bibliometric analysis.
METHODS: Literature search was done in the Scopus database using a pre-formed 
search strategy. 2629 documents were retrieved. Co-occurrence citation analysis 
using keywords and link strength was obtained using the VOSviewer ver.1.6.16. A 
three-field plot was constructed using 'biblioshiny' package of the R-studio to 
identify the various domains of frailty. Descriptive statistics were applied to 
identify the trends in frailty research, number of contributions from countries, 
fields of research involving frailty.
RESULTS: Total of 3739 publications were observed, with the USA having most 
number of contributions (740, 20%) as single country, while India has only 19 
contributions (0.5%) in the past 20 years. As a region, Europe and Central Asia 
contributed to the maximum (1714, 46.4%), most of them being from the 
high-income countries. Research on frailty has steadily increased over the past 
two decades, with most of the researches being conducted in the fields of 
Medicine, Biochemistry and Genetics. Cooccurrence citations and three-field 
plots indicate the evolving usage of frailty in other domains, such as 
cognition, mental health, indicators of survival, risk assessment, mortality, 
and quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Upon exploring frailty, it also makes one wonder if frailty could be 
the cause for what is known as death due to 'natural causes' or 'old age'. The 
implementation of extension codes in the ICD-11 related to 'Ageing' (XT9T) and 
'Old Age' (MG2A), paves way for researchers to further explore 'frailty' as a 
cause of mortality.

Management of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms and Brain Arteriovenous 
Malformations.

Nguyen TN.

OBJECTIVE: Managing a patient with an unruptured brain aneurysm or brain 
arteriovenous malformation (AVM) can lead to uncertainty about preventive 
treatment. While the bleeding risks are low, the morbidity or mortality 
associated with a hemorrhagic event is not insignificant. The objective of this 
article is to review the natural history of these vascular entities, the risk 
factors for hemorrhage, preventive treatment options, and the risks of 
treatment.
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: Randomized trials to inform preventive treatment strategies 
for unruptured intracranial aneurysms and brain AVMs are ongoing. Higher 
angiographic obliteration rates of unruptured intracranial aneurysms have been 
reported with the flow-diversion technique compared with alternative standard 
techniques. One randomized trial for unruptured brain AVMs showed a higher rate 
of morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent interventional treatment 
compared with observation.
ESSENTIAL POINTS: The decision to treat a patient with a brain aneurysm should 
consider patient factors, the patient's life expectancy, aneurysm anatomical 
factors, and treatment risks. Patients with unruptured brain AVMs should be 
observed in light of recent clinical trial data or enrolled in an ongoing 
clinical trial.

Convergence-extension in embryos is controlled by chemical and mechanical 
signalling. A key cellular process is the exchange of neighbours via T1 
transitions. We propose and analyse a model with positive feedback between 
recruitment of myosin motors and mechanical tension in cell junctions. The model 
produces active T1 events, which act to elongate the tissue perpendicular to the 
main direction of tissue stress. Using an idealised tissue patch comprising 
several active cells embedded in a matrix of passive hexagonal cells, we 
identified an optimal range of mechanical stresses to trigger an active T1 
event. We show that directed stresses also generate tension chains in a 
realistic patch made entirely of active cells of random shapes and leads to 
convergence-extension over a range of parameters. Our findings show that active 
intercalations can generate stress that activates T1 events in neighbouring 
cells, resulting in tension-dependent tissue reorganisation, in qualitative 
agreement with experiments on gastrulation in chick embryos.

OBJECTIVES: The International Respiratory Coalition's Lung Facts web resource 
provides the latest data on a range of lung conditions covering the World Health 
Organization's European Region, informed by the Global Burden of Disease 
studies: https://international-respiratory-coalition.org/lung-facts/ . Within 
Lung Facts, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) are monetised based on gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita. We describe the conceptual and empirical 
basis for using monetised DALYs to inform negotiations with policymakers to 
invest in lung care across the World Health Organization European region.
METHODS: We reflect on the existing debate and research evidence regarding the X 
value in an X*GDP per capita framework to monetise DALYs, with a focus on if 
1*GDP per capita is conceptually and practically appropriate. Using an asthma 
case study, Global Burden of Disease study 2019 DALY estimates per country are 
presented. Gross domestic product per capita are converted to international 
dollars using purchasing power parity (Int$2019).
RESULTS: Using 1*GDP per capita, the estimated monetised asthma DALY burden, for 
example, in Kyrgyzstan or Germany is: across the whole population, $44,860,483 
or $9,264,767,882, respectively; per 100,000 people, $731,600 or $10,208,317, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our indicative monetised DALY estimates can enable informed 
discussions with policy and decision makers, to guide financial investment in 
alleviating the burden of lung conditions. We suggest 1*GDP per capita as a 
benchmarked value forms a starting point for negotiation with policymakers for 
investing in lung care, by scaling the estimated lung condition DALY burden to 
the resource available in each country to tackle the burden.

PURPOSE: Value-based pricing of new, innovative health technologies defined as 
pricing through economic evaluation requires the use of a basic 
cost-effectiveness threshold. This study presents a cost-effectiveness model 
that determines the cost-effectiveness threshold for life-extending new, 
innovative technologies based on health system opportunity costs.
METHODS: To estimate health system opportunity costs, the study used German data 
and examined the period between 1896 and 2014. To this end, it determined 
intertemporal differences in the remaining lifetime spending and life expectancy 
by age and gender. To account for the age composition of the population, it 
weighted age-specific intertemporal changes in the remaining lifetime spending 
and life expectancy by the age-specific population size. To estimate life 
expectancy gains solely attributable to the health care system, it used 
aggregated data on amenable mortality. It calculated the cost-effectiveness 
ratio of health care spending in the German health care system on average and at 
the margin.
RESULTS: Based on the cost-effectiveness ratio of health care spending at the 
margin, the threshold value for life-prolonging new, innovative technologies was 
at least €42,634 per life-year gained, with a point estimate of €88,107 per 
life-year gained. Based on the average ratio, the threshold value dropped below 
€34,000 per life-year gained.
CONCLUSION: This study provides new evidence on the cost-effectiveness threshold 
for value-based pricing of new, innovative technologies. Data from Germany 
suggest that a threshold value based on health care spending at the margin is 
considerably higher than that based on the average ratio.

INTRODUCTION: Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most commonly acquired 
skeletal muscle disease of older adults involving both autoimmune attack and 
muscle degeneration. As exercise training can improve outcomes in IBM, this 
study assessed whether a combination of testosterone supplementation and 
exercise training would improve muscle strength, physical function and quality 
of life in men affected by IBM, more than exercise alone.
METHODS: This pilot study was a single site randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, crossover study. Testosterone (exercise and testosterone 
cream) and placebo (exercise and placebo cream) were each delivered for 12 
weeks, with a two-week wash-out between the two periods. The primary outcome 
measure was improvement in quadriceps isokinetic muscle strength. Secondary 
outcomes included assessment of isokinetic peak flexion force, walk capacity and 
patient reported outcomes, and other tests, comparing results between the 
placebo and testosterone arms. A 12-month Open Label Extension (OLE) was offered 
using the same outcome measures collected at 6 and 12-months.
RESULTS: 14 men completed the trial. There were no significant improvements in 
quadriceps extension strength or lean body mass, nor any of the secondary 
outcomes. Improvement in the RAND Short Form 36 patient reported outcome 
questionnaire 'emotional wellbeing' sub-category was reported during the 
testosterone arm compared to the placebo arm (mean difference [95% CI]: 6.0 
points, [95% CI 1.7,10.3]). The OLE demonstrated relative disease stability over 
the 12-month period but with a higher number of testosterone-related adverse 
events.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding testosterone supplementation to exercise training did not 
significantly improve muscle strength or physical function over a 12-week 
intervention period, compared to exercise alone. However, the combination 
improved emotional well-being over this period, and relative stabilisation of 
disease was found during the 12-month OLE. A longer duration trial involving a 
larger group of participants is warranted.

After an ischemic stroke patients often have cardiovascular complications known 
as stroke-heart syndrome. The cardiovascular management after stroke has a 
significant impact on life expectancy as well as the quality of life. The 
development and implementation of management pathways to improve outcomes for 
patients with stroke-heart syndrome requires a multidisciplinary involvement 
from health care professionals from primary, secondary and tertiary prevention 
levels. A holistic, integrated care approach could follow the ABC pathway: A) 
Appropriate antithrombotic therapy in all stroke/TIA patients in the acute phase 
as well as recommendations for the longer term treatment regimen are required to 
avoid recurrent stroke. B) For better functional and psychological status the 
assessment of poststroke cognitive and physical impairment, depression, and 
anxiety as part of routine poststroke work-up in every patient is necessary. C) 
Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities management further includes 
cardiovascular work-up, adapted drug therapy, but often also lifestyle changes 
that are central to the success of integrated care for stroke-heart syndrome. 
Greater patient and family/caregiver involvement in planning actions and the 
input and feedback on optimizing stroke care pathways is needed. Achieving 
integrated care is challenging and highly context dependent on different 
healthcare levels. A tailored approach will utilize a variety of enabling 
factors. In this narrative review, we summarize the current evidence and outline 
potential factors that will contribute to the successful implementation of 
integrated cardiovascular care for stroke-heart syndrome management.

BACKGROUND: Women have a higher life expectancy than men but experience more 
years with physical disabilities in daily life at older ages, especially women 
with a migration background. This pinpoints older women as an important target 
group for strategies that stimulate healthy lifestyle, which benefits healthy 
aging. Our study investigates motivators and barriers for healthy lifestyles and 
perspectives on determinants of healthy aging of older women. This provides 
essential information for developing targeted strategies.
METHODS: Data was collected by semi-structured digital interviews from February 
till June 2021. Women aged 55 years and older living in the Netherlands (n = 34) 
with a native Dutch (n = 24), Turkish (n = 6) or Moroccan (n = 4) migration 
background were included. Two main subjects were investigated: (1) motivators 
and barriers on their current lifestyles regarding smoking, alcohol consumption, 
physical activity, diet and sleep and (2) perspectives on determinants of 
healthy aging. Interviews were analyzed using Krueger's framework.
RESULTS: Personal health was the most common motivator for a healthy lifestyle. 
In addition, peer pressure and being outdoors were specific motivators for 
physical activity. Bad weather conditions and personal dislike to be active were 
specific barriers. The social environment, personal preferences and personal 
belief to compensate with other healthy lifestyle behaviors were barriers for 
low alcohol consumption. Personal preferences (liking unhealthy food and not 
making time) were the main barriers for a healthy diet. Sleep was not perceived 
as a form of lifestyle behavior, but rather as a personal trait. Since there 
were no smokers, specific barriers were not mentioned. For Turkish-Dutch and 
Moroccan-Dutch women, additional barriers and motivators were culture and 
religion. These were strong motivators to abstain from alcohol consumption and 
smoking, but a barrier for a healthy diet. With regard to perspectives on 
determinants of healthy aging, positive views on aging and being physically 
active were perceived as most important. Women often wanted to increase their 
physical activity or healthy diet to stimulate healthy aging. Among 
Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch women, healthy aging was also perceived as 
something in the hands of God.
CONCLUSIONS: Although motivators and barriers for a healthy lifestyle and 
perspectives on healthy aging vary for distinct lifestyles, personal health is a 
common motivator across all lifestyles. Having a migration background added 
culture and religion as distinct barriers and motivations. Strategies to improve 
lifestyle among older women should therefore have a tailored, culture sensitive 
approach (if applicable) for distinct lifestyle factors.

BACKGROUND: The aging of the population and the progressive increase in life 
expectancy in developed countries is leading to a high incidence of 
cerebrovascular diseases. Several studies have demonstrated that robot-assisted 
rehabilitation therapies combined with serious games can improve rehabilitation 
outcomes. Social interaction in the form of multiplayer games has been 
highlighted as a potential element to increase patient's motivation and exercise 
intensity, which professionals have described as one of the determining factors 
in maximizing rehabilitation outcomes. Despite this, it has not been widely 
studied. Physiological measures have been proven as an objective tool to 
evaluate patients' experience in robot-assisted rehabilitation environments. 
However, they have not been used to evaluate patients' experience in multiplayer 
robot-assisted rehabilitation therapies. The main objective of this study is to 
analyze whether the interpersonal interaction inherent in a competitive game 
mode affects the patients' physiological responses in robot-assisted 
rehabilitation environments.
METHODS: A total of 14 patients participated in this study. The results of a 
competitive game mode were compared with a single-player game mode with 
different difficulty levels. Exercise intensity and performance were measured 
through parameters extracted from the game and the information provided by the 
robotic rehabilitation platforms. The physiological response of patients in each 
game mode was measured by the heart rate (HR) and the galvanic skin response 
(GSR). Patients were asked to fill out the IMI and the overall experience 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: The exercise intensity results show that high-difficulty single-player 
game mode is similar in terms of intensity level to a competitive game mode, 
based on velocity values, reaction time and questionnaire results. However, the 
results of the physiological responses of the patients measured by GSR and HR 
are lower in the case of the competitive mode compared to the high-difficulty 
single-player game mode, obtaining results similar to those obtained in the 
low-difficulty single-player game mode.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients find the competitive game mode the most fun, which is also 
the mode they report experiencing the most effort and stress level. However, 
this subjective evaluation is not in line with the results of physiological 
responses. This study concludes that interpersonal interaction inherent to a 
competitive game mode influences patients' physiological responses. This could 
mean that social interaction is an important factor to consider when 
interpreting the results obtained from physiological measurements.

Background For frail patients with limited life expectancy, time in hospital 
following transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an important measure of 
quality of life; however, data remain scarce. Thus, we aimed to investigate 
frailty and its relation to time in hospital during the first year after 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Methods and Results From 2008 to 2020, 
all Danish patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement and 
were alive at discharge were included. Using the validated Hospital Frailty Risk 
Score, patients were categorized in the low, intermediate, and high frailty 
groups. Time in hospital and mortality up to 1 year are reported according to 
frailty groups. In total, 3437 (57.6%), 2277 (38.1%), and 257 (4.3%) were 
categorized in the low, intermediate, and high frailty groups, respectively. 
Median age was ≈81 years. Female sex and comorbidity burden were incrementally 
higher across frailty groups (low frailty: heart failure, 24.1%; stroke, 7.2%; 
and chronic kidney disease, 4.5%; versus high frailty: heart failure, 42.8%; 
stroke, 34.2%; and chronic kidney disease, 29.2%). In the low frailty group, 
50.5% survived 1 year without a hospital admission, 10.8% were hospitalized 
>15 days, and 5.8% of patients died. By contrast, 26.1% of patients in the high 
frailty group survived 1 year without a hospital admission, 26.4% were 
hospitalized >15 days, and 15.6% died within 1 year. Differences persisted in 
models adjusted for sex, age, frailty, and comorbidity burden (excluding 
overlapping comorbidities). Conclusions Among patients undergoing transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement, frailty is strongly associated with time in hospital 
and mortality. Prevention strategies for frail patients to reduce 
hospitalization burden could be beneficial.

Patients with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have a grave 
prognosis with limited life expectancy. Here, a phase II clinical trial was 
conducted to investigate the effect of Andrographis paniculata (AP) on the 
palliative care of patients with metastatic ESCC. Patients with metastatic or 
locally advanced ESCC deemed unfit for surgery, and who have already completed 
palliative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy or are not fit for these 
treatments, were recruited. These patients were prescribed AP concentrated 
granules for 4 months. They also received clinical and quality of life 
assessments for clinical response, as well as positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography at 3 and 6 months after AP treatment for the 
assessment of tumor volume. Furthermore, the change in gut microbiota 
composition after AP treatment was studied. From the results, among the 30 
recruited patients, 10 completed the entire course of AP treatment, while 20 
received partial AP treatment. Patients who completed the AP treatment achieved 
significantly longer overall survival periods with the maintenance of the 
quality of life during the survival period when compared to those who could not 
complete AP treatment. The treatment effect of AP also contributed to the shift 
of the overall structure of gut microbiota for ESCC patients towards those of 
healthy individuals. The significance of this study is the establishment of AP 
as a safe and effective palliative treatment for patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma of the esophagus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
clinical trial of AP water extract in esophageal cancer patients demonstrating 
its new medicinal use.

AIMS: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common, chronic 
gastrointestinal condition characterized by heartburn, chest pain, 
regurgitation, and bloating. The current standard of care includes chronic 
treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or, in selected patients, 
laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery. RefluxStop is a novel implantable device 
indicated for GERD patients eligible for laparoscopic surgical treatment. The 
aim of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of RefluxStop against 
available treatment options for GERD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of RefluxStop compared with PPI-based medical management (MM) 
and two surgical management options, LNF and magnetic sphincter augmentation 
(MSA, LINX system), in people with GERD. Clinical outcomes and costs were 
estimated over a lifetime horizon from the UK National Health Service 
perspective and an annual discount rate of 3.5% was applied.
RESULTS: RefluxStop showed favorable surgical outcomes compared with both LNF 
and MSA. The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared with MM, 
LNF, and MSA were £4,156, £6,517, and £249 per QALY gained, respectively. At the 
UK cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained, the probability that 
RefluxStop was cost-effective against MM, LNF, and MSA was 100%, 93%, and 100%, 
respectively.
LIMITATIONS: The model presented the results of a comparison, with evidence for 
RefluxStop derived from its single-arm CE mark trial and that for comparators 
from the literature. The varied clinical care pathway of individual GERD 
patients was necessarily simplified for modeling purposes, and necessary 
assumptions were made; however, the model results proved robust to sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of RefluxStop was estimated to extend life expectancy 
and improve quality-of-life of GERD patients when compared with MM, LNF, and 
MSA. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that RefluxStop 
is highly likely to be a cost-effective treatment option within NHS England.

IMPORTANCE: US primary care practitioners (PCPs) are the largest clinical 
workforce, but few provide addiction care. Primary care is a practical place to 
expand addiction services, including buprenorphine and harm reduction kits, yet 
the clinical outcomes and health care sector costs are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term clinical outcomes, costs, and 
cost-effectiveness of integrated buprenorphine and harm reduction kits in 
primary care for people who inject opioids.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this modeling study, the Reducing 
Infections Related to Drug Use Cost-Effectiveness (REDUCE) microsimulation 
model, which tracks serious injection-related infections, overdose, 
hospitalization, and death, was used to examine the following treatment 
strategies: (1) PCP services with external referral to addiction care (status 
quo), (2) PCP services plus onsite buprenorphine prescribing with referral to 
offsite harm reduction kits (BUP), and (3) PCP services plus onsite 
buprenorphine prescribing and harm reduction kits (BUP plus HR). Model inputs 
were derived from clinical trials and observational cohorts, and costs were 
discounted annually at 3%. The cost-effectiveness was evaluated over a lifetime 
from the modified health care sector perspective, and sensitivity analyses were 
performed to address uncertainty. Model simulation began January 1, 2021, and 
ran for the entire lifetime of the cohort.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life-years (LYs), hospitalizations, mortality from 
sequelae (overdose, severe skin and soft tissue infections, and endocarditis), 
costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: The simulated cohort included 2.25 million people and reflected the age 
and gender of US persons who inject opioids. Status quo resulted in 6.56 
discounted LYs at a discounted cost of $203 500 per person (95% credible 
interval, $203 000-$222 000). Each strategy extended discounted life expectancy: 
BUP by 0.16 years and BUP plus HR by 0.17 years. Compared with status quo, BUP 
plus HR reduced sequelae-related mortality by 33%. The mean discounted lifetime 
cost per person of BUP and BUP plus HR were more than that of the status quo 
strategy. The dominating strategy was BUP plus HR. Compared with status quo, BUP 
plus HR was cost-effective (ICER, $34 400 per LY). During a 5-year time horizon, 
BUP plus HR cost an individual PCP practice approximately $13 000.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This modeling study of integrated addiction service 
in primary care found improved clinical outcomes and modestly increased costs. 
The integration of addiction service into primary care practices should be a 
health care system priority.

Sustained life stress and low socioeconomic status are among the major causes of 
aging-related diseases and decreased life expectancy. Experimental rodent models 
can help to identify the underlying mechanisms, yet very few studies address the 
long-term consequences of social stress on aging. We conducted a randomized 
study involving more than 300 male mice of commonly used laboratory strains 
(C57BL/6J, CD1, and Sv129Ev) chosen for the spontaneous aggression gradient and 
stress-vulnerability. Mice were exposed to a lifelong chronic psychosocial 
stress protocol to model social gradients in aging and disease vulnerability. 
Low social rank, inferred based on a discretized aggression index, was found to 
negatively impact lifespan in our study population. However, social rank 
interacted with genetic background in that low-ranking C57BL/6J, high-ranking 
Sv129Ev, and middle-ranking CD1 mice had lower survival, respectively, implying 
a cost of maintaining a given social rank that varies across strains. Machine 
learning linear discriminant analysis identified baseline fat-free mass as the 
most important predictor of mouse genetic background and social rank in the 
present dataset. Finally, strain and social rank differences were significantly 
associated with epigenetic changes, most significantly in Sv129Ev mice and in 
high-ranking compared to lower ranking subjects. Overall, we identified genetic 
background and social rank as critical contextual modifiers of aging and 
lifespan in an ethologically relevant rodent model of social stress, thereby 
providing a preclinical experimental paradigm to study the impact of social 
determinants of health disparities and accelerated aging.

PURPOSE: To understand the experiences and preferences of Indonesian cancer 
survivors regarding medical information disclosure and advance care planning.
METHODS: On the basis of systematic reviews of the scientific literature, 
qualitative studies, and expert-panel input, we developed an online survey that 
was distributed to nine cancer survivor support groups in Indonesia.
RESULTS: A total of 1,030 valid responses were received. Most participants were 
younger than 60 years (92%), female (91%), married (78%), Muslim (75%), 
diagnosed with breast cancer (68%), highly educated (64%), and more than one 
year beyond diagnosis of their cancer. If diagnosed with a life-limiting 
illness, participants wished to be informed about their diagnosis (74%), disease 
severity (61%), estimated curability (81%), expected disease trajectory (66%), 
and estimated life expectancy (37%). Between 46%-69% of the participants wished 
to discuss four topics of advance care planning (end-of-life treatments, 
resuscitation, health care proxies, and what matters at the end of life); 
21%-42% had done so. Of those who wished to discuss these topics, 36%-79% 
preferred to do so with their family members. The most important reasons for not 
being willing to engage in advance care planning were the desire to surrender to 
God's will and to focus on here and now.
CONCLUSION: In a group of cancer survivors, most of them were highly educated, 
young, female, and diagnosed with breast cancer. Their preferences for medical 
information and advance care planning varied, with the majority wishing for 
information and involvement in advance care planning. Culturally sensitive 
advance care planning involves health care professionals eliciting individuals' 
preferences for medical information disclosure and discussing different topics 
in advance care planning conversations.
