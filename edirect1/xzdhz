BACKGROUND: Individuals with severe mental illness, e.g. schizophrenia have up 
to a 20% shortened life expectancy compared to the general population. 
Cardiovascular disease, due to cardiometabolic risk and metabolic syndrome, 
accounts for most of this excess mortality. A scoping search revealed that there 
has not been a review of published studies on the role of pharmacy in relation 
to cardiometabolic risk, metabolic syndrome and related diseases (e.g. type 2 
diabetes) in individuals with severe mental illness.
METHODS: A mixed-methods systematic review was performed. Eleven databases were 
searched using a comprehensive search strategy to identify English-language 
studies where pharmacy was involved in an intervention for cardiometabolic risk, 
metabolic syndrome or related diseases in severe mental illness in any study 
setting from any country of origin. First, a mapping review was conducted. Then, 
implementation strategies used to implement the study intervention were 
classified using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care 
Taxonomy. Impact of the study intervention on the process (e.g. rate of 
diagnosis of metabolic syndrome) and clinical (e.g. diabetic control) 
outcomes were analysed where possible (statistical tests of significance 
obtained for quantitative outcome parameters reported). Quality assessment was 
undertaken using a modified Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.
RESULTS: A total of 33 studies were identified. Studies were heterogeneous for 
all characteristics. A total of 20 studies reported quantitative outcome data 
that allowed for detailed analysis of the impact of the study intervention. The 
relationship between the total number of implementation strategies used and 
impact on outcomes measured is unclear. Inclusion of face-to-face interaction in 
implementation of interventions appears to be important in having a 
statistically significantly positive impact on measured outcomes even when used 
on its own. Few studies included pharmacy staff in community or general 
practitioner practices (n = 2), clinical outcomes, follow up of individuals 
after implementation of interventions (n = 3). No studies included synthesis of 
qualitative data.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that implementation strategies involving 
face-to-face interaction of pharmacists with other members of the 
multidisciplinary team can improve process outcomes when used as the sole 
strategy. Further work is needed on clinical outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular risk 
reduction), role of community pharmacy and qualitative studies.

The concentration of chloride in sweat remains the most robust biomarker for 
confirmatory diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF), a common life-shortening genetic 
disorder. Early diagnosis via quantitative assessment of sweat chloride allows 
prompt initiation of care and is critically important to extend life expectancy 
and improve quality of life. The collection and analysis of sweat using 
conventional wrist-strapped devices and iontophoresis can be cumbersome, 
particularly for infants with fragile skin, who often have insufficient sweat 
production. Here, we introduce a soft, epidermal microfluidic device ("sweat 
sticker") designed for the simple and rapid collection and analysis of sweat. 
Intimate, conformal coupling with the skin supports nearly perfect efficiency in 
sweat collection without leakage. Real-time image analysis of chloride reagents 
allows for quantitative assessment of chloride concentrations using a smartphone 
camera, without requiring extraction of sweat or external analysis. Clinical 
validation studies involving patients with CF and healthy subjects, across a 
spectrum of age groups, support clinical equivalence compared to existing device 
platforms in terms of accuracy and demonstrate meaningful reductions in rates of 
leakage. The wearable microfluidic technologies and smartphone-based analytics 
reported here establish the foundation for diagnosis of CF outside of clinical 
settings.

Orbital metastasis from breast cancer is relatively uncommon and is not the 
dominant prognosis. While it can reduce a patient's QOL through symptoms such as 
diplopia, visual impairment, and exophthalmos, evidence suggests that 
radiotherapy might improve these symptoms in a relatively short period. We 
report 3 cases of orbital metastasis from breast cancer treated with 
radiotherapy. All 3 patients were diagnosed with stage Ⅳ breast cancer and 
underwent chemotherapy and endocrine therapy for several years. When they were 
diagnosed with orbital metastasis, their life expectancy was only a few months 
with debilitating illness. They received radiotherapy, which caused slight side 
effects including skin disorders. The cancer symptoms rapidly improved in 2 
patients, suggesting that radiotherapy can be an efficacious choice for 
improving the QOL for patients with orbital metastasis from breast cancer, 
especially for patients in terminal status.

INTRODUCTION: In treating nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients, excellent tumor 
control and patient survival rates can be achieved in the era of 
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). However, treatment-related toxicities 
affect the quality of life (QoL) of NPC survivors. This study was devised to 
estimate the life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and 
survival-weighted psychometric scores (SWPS) in NPC patients.
METHODS: A sample of 875 non-metastatic NPC patients diagnosed between January 
1, 2009 and June 30, 2013 was collected for estimation of lifetime survival 
function. All patients were followed up until death or censored on December 31, 
2015. To obtain the utility and psychometric score for estimation of LE, QALE, 
and SWPS, 99 patients were measured with the Taiwanese version of the EuroQol 
instrument (EQ-5D) and the Taiwan Chinese versions of the European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-H&N35 between October 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017. By 
utilizing linear extrapolation of a logit-transformed curve, the LE of NPC 
patients can be estimated. The QALE and SWPS can be obtained by combining the LE 
and the corresponding QOL function.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 875 non-metastatic NPC patients was 50.3 years. The 
estimated average LE and QALE for NPC patients and for the reference population 
were 15.5 years and 14.3 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 29.5 years and 
29.5 QALYs, respectively. On average, the estimated lifelong duration of pain 
and painkiller use were 6.0 years and 2.2 years. The estimated lifelong duration 
of impairment of swallowing, speech, smell and taste were 14.0, 9.8, 8.7, and 
7.5 years, respectively. The estimated lifelong duration of problems with dry 
mouth, teeth, emotion, fatigue, sleep, and social contact were 13.4, 10.1, 9.1, 
12.3, 6.7, and 4.5 years, respectively. The estimated lifelong duration of 
tube-feeding was 1.3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimated LE and QALE for NPC patients were 15.5 years and 14.3 
QALYs. Furthermore, SWPS could help people understand more about the impact of 
radiotherapy on NPC patients. These data could also be useful for policy makers 
to allocate limited resources in health care.

Overall Survival Compared to Life Expectancy in Patients with Renal Cell 
Carcinoma.

PURPOSE: Reports suggest that partial nephrectomy provides no significant 
benefit in terms of cancer-specific and overall survival (OS) compared to 
radical nephrectomy. Here, we focused on survival in terms of life expectancy 
and investigated the significance of partial nephrectomy for localized renal 
cell carcinoma (RCC) patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study included 937 patients (median age 
63 years) with localized RCC who underwent partial nephrectomy or radical 
nephrectomy. Various predictive factors were explored, and the association 
between actual OS and life expectancy was analyzed.
RESULTS: Performance status (PS) ≥1 and tumor size ≥40 mm were identified as 
independent poor prognostic factors for cancer-specific survival. Age ≥60, male 
sex, PS ≥1, C-reactive protein elevation, pT1b stage, and radical nephrectomy 
were identified as independent poor prognostic factors for OS. OS and life 
expectancy did not differ in the partial nephrectomy group (P=0.11). OS was 
significantly shorter than life expectancy in the radical nephrectomy group 
(P<0.0001). In PS0 or pT1a patients, there was a significant difference between 
actual OS and life expectancy in the radical nephrectomy group (P<0.0001), but 
not in the partial nephrectomy group (P=0.15). In patients with a life 
expectancy ≥10 years, PS0, and pTa, OS and life expectancy differed in the 
radical nephrectomy group, but not in the partial nephrectomy group.
CONCLUSION: Partial nephrectomy can improve actual OS, and notably, PS and tumor 
size are crucial factors that determine the choice of surgical procedure. 
Further research is needed to establish appropriate treatment strategies and 
criteria for clinical practice.

The stellar gains in life expectancy and health over the past century have been 
accompanied by an increase in societal and health inequalities. This health gap 
between the most and least fortunate in our society is widening, driven by 
complex social determinants of health, as well as healthcare systems themselves. 
Physicians are not just well-qualified and well-placed to act as advocates for 
change, but have a moral duty to do so: to stand by silently is to be complicit. 
Following a workshop on health inequalities and medical training at the Royal 
College of Physicians Trainees Committee, we sought to examine how health 
inequalities could be addressed through changes to the medical education system. 
We discuss the arguments for reform in recruitment to medicine, and changes to 
undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education in order to equip 
the profession to deliver meaningful improvements in health inequalities. We 
propose a population health credential as a mechanism by which specialists can 
gain additional skills to take on leadership roles addressing health 
inequalities, allowing them to support colleagues in public health and bring in 
specialty-specific knowledge and experience.

The NHS faces challenges today that it was not designed to tackle at its 
conception in 1948. The UK demographic has changed considerably with higher life 
expectancy and 'an ageing population'. Keeping this demographic healthy through 
prevention and management of age-related degeneration is crucial to their 
independence and improving resource utilisation. The Department of Health and 
Social Care's agenda for digital transformation of the NHS is facilitating a 
move towards preventative healthcare and greater community care, which will 
likely be supported by virtual healthcare delivery models. Despite views on 
digital illiteracy in the older population, this demographic may stand to 
benefit the most. Research has shown that the older demographic adopts 
technology in line with the technology acceptance model if their needs are 
carefully considered. Executed successfully, the deployment of virtual 
healthcare could save transformational costs to the NHS and support better 
quality of life for the senior members of society. This is particularly relevant 
in the current COVID-19 pandemic with patients facing challenges in accessing 
outpatient appointments. With many hospitals kickstarting virtual outpatient 
clinics to ensure continuity of care during a time of social isolation; we await 
to see the ingenuities that arise from the current pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: The study aim was to evaluate the cost effectiveness and budget 
impact of siponimod compared to interferon beta-1a for adult patients with 
secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease, from a 
Swiss health insurance perspective.
METHODS: We conducted an analysis using a Markov cohort model with a cycle 
length of 1 year, life-long time horizon, and discount rate of 3% for cost and 
health outcomes. We used a matching-adjusted indirect comparison to estimate 
clinical outcomes using data from the EXPAND randomised controlled trial of 
siponimod vs placebo and the Nordic SPMS randomised controlled trial of 
interferon beta-1a vs placebo as the basis for estimates of disability 
progression and relapse outcomes. We used 6-month confirmed disability 
progression results to estimate disability progression in the base-case 
analysis. We calculated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on an external 
study that administered the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire to European patients with 
multiple sclerosis. We included costs (Swiss Franc (CHF), year 2020) of drug 
acquisition/administration, adverse events and disease management. We also 
performed a budget impact analysis to estimate the cost over the first 3 years 
of introducing siponimod.
RESULTS: For the base case, siponimod resulted in mean incremental costs of CHF 
84,901 (siponimod: CHF 567,838, interferon beta-1a: CHF 482,937) and mean 
incremental QALYs of 1.591 (siponimod: 7.495, interferon beta-1a: 5.905), 
leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 53,364 per QALY 
gained. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of the cost 
effectiveness of siponimod assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 
100,000 per QALY gained was 90%. Siponimod was projected to result in drug 
administration costs for siponimod of CHF 23,817,856 in the first 3 years after 
introduction, accompanied by large cost offsets in drug acquisition of other 
multiple sclerosis drugs. Considering drug administration, monitoring and 
adverse event management costs, it was estimated to result in additional 
healthcare costs in Switzerland of CHF 2,177,021.
CONCLUSIONS: In the base-case analysis, we found that siponimod may be cost 
effective for treating Swiss adult patients with SPMS with active disease. The 
results of the cost-effectiveness analyses are valid under the assumption that 
the efficacy of siponimod and the comparators on disability progression for the 
overall SPMS population would be the same in the active SPMS population.

Data collected over the past four decades show the life expectancy of indigenous 
Taiwanese to be 8 to 10 years lower than the general, predominantly Han Chinese, 
population. This suggests the persistence of inequities in the public health 
system in Taiwan. Several facets of this issue, including lack of consideration 
of the characteristics and lifestyle of ethnic populations in health policy 
planning and implementation work and the continued location-based focus of 
medical care resource distribution policies, are being actively discussed. 
However, investigations of factors related to the relatively poor health status 
of indigenous Taiwanese have not considered the traumatic and lingering effects 
of colonisation. This article briefly introduces the health status of indigenous 
Taiwanese and the indigenous nursing workforce and then presents a review of the 
literature on factors related to the under-representation of indigenous 
Taiwanese in nursing programs and the nursing workforce. Indigenous Taiwanese 
were found to be absent from public-health policymaking. Moreover, 
indigenous-related traditional knowledge and values are not being effectively 
transmitted to younger generations. A diverse nursing workforce should reflect 
and respond to not only indigenous peoples but also the general population in 
Taiwan.

In Taiwan, The increase in life expectancy in Taiwan has increased the incidents 
of age-related problems among patients with mental illness. Therefore, the needs 
related to long-term care in mental health are significantly important. These 
needs include: (1) reducing stigmatization; (2) reducing the physical and 
economic burden of caregivers; (3) constructing a comprehensive, long-term care 
service system; and (4) developing assessment tools suitable to the long-term 
care of patients with mental illness. Moreover, six dilemmas in meeting 
long-term care needs were identified. These dilemmas include: (1) lack of a 
model of continuous care and of a platform for integrating hospital and 
community resources; (2) poor / inadequate service quality provided by certain 
community rehabilitation institutions; (3) the needs of patient/family centered 
care; (4) the persistence of stigma and misunderstanding; (5) the heavy burdens 
borne by family members providing long-term care; and (6) the disconnect between 
subsequent needs and the disability assessment system. Policy suggestions 
provided in this article include: (1) establish an inclusive platform for mental 
health long-term care information and resource integration; (2) construct 
long-term care centers for patients with mental health conditions; (3) train 
adequate manpower to provide long-term care services to these patients; and (4) 
promote community inclusiveness for these patients. In order to enter the era of 
long-term mental health care, government policy should target long-term care 
programs to meet the needs of patients with mental health conditions. These 
programs should include seamlessly integrating services into the long-term 
mental health care system and the care resources of community mental health, 
developing suitable assessment tools, establishing a multidisciplinary team of

Since several decades, PEGylation is known to be the clinical standard to 
enhance pharmacokinetics of biotherapeutics. In this study, we introduce 
polyglycerol (PG) of different lengths and architectures (linear and 
hyperbranched) as an alternative polymer platform to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 
for half-life extension (HLE). We designed site-selective N-terminally modified 
PG-protein conjugates of the therapeutic protein anakinra (IL-1ra, Kineret) and 
compared them systematically with PEG analogues of similar molecular weights. 
Linear PG and PEG conjugates showed comparable hydrodynamic sizes and retained 
their secondary structure, whereas binding affinity to IL-1 receptor 1 decreased 
with increasing polymer length, yet remained in the low nanomolar range for all 
conjugates. The terminal half-life of a 40 kDa linear PG-modified anakinra was 
extended 4-fold compared to the unmodified protein, close to its PEG analogue. 
Our results demonstrate similar performances of PEG- and PG-anakinra conjugates 
and therefore highlight the outstanding potential of polyglycerol as a PEG 
alternative for half-life extension of biotherapeutics.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: practical recommendations to enhance clinical 
practice.

Management of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma should provide a holistic approach to a 
patient's wellbeing. Treatments depend on the stage of lymphoma. Patients with 
the early stages tend to have a near-normal life expectancy. Management should 
be aimed at improving the extent of disease and reducing symptoms with minimal 
therapeutic adverse effects. Skin-directed treatments are preferred and may be 
used in combination with treatments for symptom relief such as anti-pruritic 
medication. In advanced stages of disease where the median life expectancy is 
reduced the aims are also to prevent disease progression and prolong life, and 
this requires a multidisciplinary approach. Symptom control remains important as 
patients often have painful, itchy disfiguring lesions which greatly impact on 
health-related quality of life. National and international guidelines provide 
stage-related treatment options to be considered with first-line options 
followed by subsequent second-line therapies. All are listed in no particular 
order of preference and are chosen according to patients' needs and expertise of 
the treating centre. Several first-line options may be chosen before moving to 
the second-line options. Three drugs received European Medicines Agency approval 
in 2017 and 2018 (chlormethine gel, brentuximab and mogamulizumab) but there 
still remains an unmet need for more improved treatments or combinations. Most 
treatments only result in a partial response and there is no cure for 
early-stage disease; as such, patients live for a long time with their disease. 
In the advanced stages if a good response is achieved eligible patients will be 
considered for an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant.

PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of prostatic artery embolization 
(PAE) on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in the setting of localized 
prostate cancer (PCa).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, institutional 
review board-approved study from December 2016 to June 2020 of 21 patients 
(median age, 72; range, 63-83 years) with moderate LUTS and localized PCa. 
Clinical effectiveness was evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks using International 
Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and quality of life (QoL) improvement. Seventeen 
patients were scheduled to receive definitive radiotherapy (RT) after PAE; 13 
patients completed RT. Short-term imaging signs of oncologic progression were 
evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks defined by at least one of the following on magnetic 
resonance imaging: increased Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System score of 
index lesion(s) to at least 4, new extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle 
involvement, or pelvic lymphadenopathy. Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
was used for analysis.
RESULTS: IPSS improved by a median of 12 (n = 19, P < .0001) and 14 (n = 14, P < 
.0001) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. QoL improved by a median of 2 (n = 19, P 
< .0001) and 3 (n = 3, P < .0001) at 6 and 12 weeks. Prostate volume decreased 
by a median of 24% (n = 19, P < .0001) and 36% (n = 12, P = .015) at 6 and 12 
weeks. No patients demonstrated disease progression at 6 (n = 16) or 12 (n = 8) 
weeks by imaging. No patients experienced increased prostate-specific antigen 
after RT, grade ≥3 adverse events, or greater genitourinary toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: PAE is effective and safe for the treatment of men with LUTS from 
benign prostatic hyperplasia in the setting of concomitant, localized, 
non-obstructive PCa.

A global rise in life expectancy comes with an increased burden of serious 
life-long health issues and the need for useful real-time measures of the aging 
processes. Studies have shown the value of biochemical signatures of 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation as clinically relevant biomarkers to 
differentiate healthy from accelerated aging. Most human biological processes 
rely on glycosylation of proteins to regulate their function, but these events 
appear sensitive to environmental changes, age, and the presence of disease. 
Specifically, variations in N-glycosylation of IgG can adversely affect 
inflammatory pathways underpinning unhealthy aging and chronic disease 
pathogenesis. This expert review highlights the discrepancies between an 
organism's age in years of life (chronological age) versus age in terms of 
health status (biological age). The article examines and synthesizes the studies 
on IgG N-glycan profiles and the third alphabet of life, the sugar code, in 
relation to their relevance as dynamic indicators of aging, and to differentiate 
between normal and accelerated aging. The levels of N-glycan structures change 
with aging, suggesting that monitoring the alterations of serum glycan 
biosignatures with glycomics might allow real-time studies of human aging in the 
near future. Glycomics brings in yet another systems science technology platform 
to strengthen the emerging multiomics studies of aging and aging-related 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic factors may be involved in risk of multiple sclerosis 
(MS), either indirectly or as confounding factors. In this study two 
comprehensive indicators reflecting socioeconomic differences, including the 
Human Development Index (HDI) and Prosperity Index (PI), were used to assess the 
impact of these factors on the worldwide distribution of MS.
METHODS: The data for this global ecological study were obtained from three 
comprehensive databases including the Global Burden of Disease (as the source of 
MS indices), United Nations Development Programme (source for HDI) and the 
Legatum Institute Database for PI. MS indices (including prevalence, incidence, 
mortality, and disability-adjusted life years) were all analyzed in the form of 
age- and sex-standardized. Correlation and regression analyses were used to 
investigate the relationship between HDI and PI and their subsets with MS 
indices.
RESULTS: All MS indices were correlated with HDI and PI. It was also found that 
developed countries had significantly higher prevalence and incidence rates of 
MS than developing countries. Education and governance from the PI, and gross 
national income and expected years of schooling from the HDI were more 
associated with MS. Education was significantly related to MS indices (p < 0.01) 
in both developed and developing countries.
CONCLUSION: In general, the difference in income and the socioeconomic 
development globally have created a landscape for MS that should be studied in 
more detail in future studies.

BACKGROUND: Making a meaningful decision on deprescribing of potentially 
inappropriate medications in older adults with life-limiting illnesses (LLIs) 
and limited life expectancy (LLE) is often challenging. Therefore, we aimed to 
elicit opinion and gain consensus on a deprescribing tool for use in this 
population.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A modified-Delphi method will be used to obtain a 
consensus from a panel of experts in geriatric therapeutics on a deprescribing 
tool for use in people aged ≥65 years with LLIs and LLE. Through an online 
survey, in the initial round, the panel will anonymously elicit their opinion on 
a series of items related to the conceptual model of the deprescribing tool, its 
practicality and deprescribing of medications, while on the controlled feedback 
in subsequent rounds till a consensus is reached or the panellists stop revising 
their answers. In each round, panel members will be using a 5-point Likert scale 
to rate their agreement with the statement. Consensus will be considered on ≥75% 
of agreement on the statements.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All the participants will receive an invitation and 
participant information but they need to consent for the participation. Ethics 
approval has been granted from the University of Queensland Health and 
Behavioural Sciences, Low and Negligible Risk Ethics Sub-Committee (reference: 
2020001069). The results of this project will be disseminated through 
conferences and a peer-reviewed clinical journal.

Cancer Screening in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients: A Focus on Screening 
Liver, Lung, and Kidney Recipients for Cancers Related to the Transplanted 
Organ.

Over the last few decades, the life expectancy of solid organ transplant 
recipients (SOTRs) has improved significantly. With SOTRs living longer, more 
recipients are dying from cancer. There is a reported 2- to 3-fold increased 
risk of cancer-specific mortality in SOTRs compared with the general population. 
Cancer in an SOTR can be de novo, recurrent, or donor-derived. Cancer screening 
in this population is crucial, as early detection and treatment may improve 
outcomes. In the absence of randomized controlled trials dedicated to SOTRs, 
clinicians rely on clinical practice guidelines from regional and national 
transplant societies; however, these may vary considerably across jurisdictions 
and transplanted organ. At present, no widely accepted consensus exists for 
cancer screening protocols in SOTRs, particularly with regard to screening for 
malignancy related to transplanted organ. Some SOTRs may be at higher risk of 
malignancies within the allograft. This is particularly the case in lung and 
liver recipients, though less common in kidney recipients who are at increased 
risk of developing renal cell cancer in their native kidneys. This increased 
risk has not been uniformly incorporated into screening recommendations for 
SOTRs. In this review, we summarize the cancer screening recommendations for 
SOTRs from various transplant organizations based on transplanted organ. This 
review also discusses the complexity and controversies surrounding screening of 
cancer in the allograft and future avenues to improve cancer detection in this 
context. More studies specific to SOTRs are required to form generalizable and 
evidence-based cancer screening guidelines, particularly with respect to cancer 
screening in the allograft.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel plus aspirin within 48 h of 
acute minor strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) has been indicated to 
effectively reduce the rate of recurrent strokes. However, the efficacy of 
clopidogrel has been shown to be affected by cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) 
polymorphisms. Patients carrying loss-of-function alleles (LoFAs) at a low risk 
of recurrence (ESRS < 3) cannot benefit from clopidogrel plus aspirin at all and 
may have an increased bleeding risk. In order to optimize antiplatelet therapy 
for these patients and avoid the waste of medical resources, it is important to 
identify the subgroups that genuinely benefit from DAPT with clopidogrel plus 
aspirin through CYP2C19 genotyping. This study sought to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of CYP2C19 genotyping to guide drug therapy for acute minor 
strokes or high-risk TIAs in China. A decision tree and Markov model were 
constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CYP2C19 genotyping. We used a 
healthcare payer perspective, and the primary outcomes included quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs), costs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. 
CYP2C19 genotyping resulted in a lifetime gain of 0.031 QALYs at an additional 
cost of CNY 420.13 (US$ 59.85), yielding an ICER of CNY 13,552.74 (US$ 1930.59) 
per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that genetic testing 
was more cost-effective in 95.7% of the simulations at the willingness-to-pay 
threshold of CNY 72,100 (GDP per capita, US$ 10,300) per QALY. Therefore, 
CYP2C19 genotyping to guide antiplatelet therapy for acute minor strokes and 
high-risk TIAs is highly cost-effective in China.

The field of cognitive epidemiology studies the prospective associations between 
cognitive abilities and health outcomes. We review research in this field over 
the past decade and describe how our understanding of the association between 
intelligence and all-cause mortality has consolidated with the appearance of 
new, population-scale data. To try to understand the association better, we 
discuss how intelligence relates to specific causes of death, diseases/diagnoses 
and biomarkers of health through the adult life course. We examine the extent to 
which mortality and health associations with intelligence might be attributable 
to people's differences in education, other indicators of socioeconomic status, 
health literacy and adult environments and behaviours. Finally, we discuss 
whether genetic data provide new tools to understand parts of the 
intelligence-health associations. Social epidemiologists, differential 
psychologists and behavioural and statistical geneticists, among others, 
contribute to cognitive epidemiology; advances will occur by building on a 
common cross-disciplinary knowledge base.

INTRODUCTION: The low frequency of cases and deaths from the SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 
virus in some countries of Africa has called our attention about the unusual 
behavior of this disease. The ivermectin is considered a drug of choice for 
various parasitic and viral diseases and shown to have in vitro effects against 
SARS-CoV-2.
AIMS: Our study aimed to describe SARS-CoV2 infection and death rates in African 
countries that participated in an intensive Ivermectin mass campaign carried out 
to control onchocerciasis and compare them with those of countries that did not 
participate.
METHODS: Data from 19 countries that participated in the World Health 
Organization (WHO) sponsored African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control 
(APOC), from 1995 until 2015, were compared with thirty-five (Non-APOC), 
countries that were not included. Information was obtained from 
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ database. Generalized Poisson 
regression models were used to obtain estimates of the effect of APOC status on 
cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rates.
RESULTS: After controlling for different factors, including the Human 
Development Index (HDI), APOC countries (vs. non-APOC), show 28% lower mortality 
(0.72; 95% CI: 0.67-0.78) and 8% lower rate of infection (0.92; 95% CI: 
0.91-0.93) due to COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence in mortality rates and number of cases is 
significantly lower among the APOC countries compared to non-APOC countries. 
That a mass public health preventive campaign against COVID-19 may have taken 
place, inadvertently, in some African countries with massive community 
ivermectin use is an attractive hypothesis. Additional studies are needed to
