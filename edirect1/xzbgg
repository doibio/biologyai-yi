Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants are induced in various cellular 
compartments upon pathogen infection and act as an early signal during 
plant-pathogen interactions. Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) is involved 
in plant disease resistance through the regulation of the ROS level via the 
ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle. In this study, TaMDHAR4 was firstly 
isolated from wheat cultivar Suwon 11, and this protein exhibits high similarity 
to MDHAR proteins from other plant species. Bioinformatics analyses indicated 
that TaMDHAR4 contains typical structural features, such as mPTS-like sequences 
in the C-terminal extension and trans-membrane domain followed by five basic 
arginine residues (-RKRRR), which predicted that this protein may be localized 
in the peroxisome. qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that TaMDHAR4 could be induced 
by various exogenous hormones, such as ABA, MeJA, and ETH. TaMDHAR4 is sharply 
down-regulated at 12 and 18 hpi only in wheat leaves challenged with Puccinia 
striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) race CYR23 and induced at 48 hpi with both Pst 
races CYR23 and CYR31. SOD and APX injection analyses demonstrated that TaMDHAR4 
may be involved in the interaction between wheat and Pst through the regulation 
of its expression. Moreover, the knockdown of TaMDHAR4 through virus-induced 
gene silencing (VIGS) enhanced the wheat resistance to Pst by inhibiting 
sporulation in the compatible interaction. Histological observations also 
demonstrated that silenced wheat resulted in an increased proportion of necrotic 
area at the infection sites and suppressed Pst hypha elongation. The study 
provided novel insights into the molecular functions of TaMDHAR4 during 
plant-pathogen interactions.

Obesity is the result of a complex interplay among several factors leading to 
medical, functional and psychosocial consequences that markedly reduce life 
expectancy and impair quality of life. Is obesity itself a disease? Is obesity a 
brain disease? Who should treat obesity? This paper is a narrative review aimed 
to describe and to argue the prevalent position of some major Italian scientific 
and academic institutions dealing with obesity. According to the recent 
statements and recommendations published by the Italian Society for Obesity 
(SIO) and the Italian Society for the Study of Eating Disorders (SISDCA), the 
management of obese patients should include five main levels of care: (1) 
primary care, (2) outpatient treatment, (3) intensive outpatient treatment, (4) 
residential rehabilitative treatment, and (5) hospitalization. Ideally, patients 
suffering from obesity need a multidimensional evaluation intended to design an 
individualized treatment plan applying different procedures and therapeutic 
strategies (diet, physical activity and functional rehabilitation, educational 
therapy, cognitive-behavior therapy, drug therapy, and bariatric surgery). This 
thorough approach should address not only weight loss but also quality of weight 
loss, medical and psychiatric comorbidity, psychosocial problems, and physical 
disability. Such management of obesity requires an effective multiprofessional 
team, while health services have to overcome a number of administrative and 
organizational barriers that do not account for diseases requiring resources and 
professionals from different areas of medicine. Integrating several competences 
in a team-based approach demands specific education, skills and expertise. As 
for other diseases, the principles of complexity theory may offer a model useful 
to implement both teamwork and care delivery for patients with obesity.

Rapid detection of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is critical to the 
effective early treatment and prevention of the transmission of tuberculosis. 
However, conventional drug susceptibility tests for M. tuberculosis require up 
to several weeks. In the present study, the One Label Extension genotyping 
method was adapted for rapid detection of drug resistance-associated sequence 
variations in six genes of M. tuberculosis, viz. rpoB, rpsL, rrs, embB, katG, or 
inhA. The method utilizes polymerase chain reaction amplified fragments of the 
drug resistant genes as reaction templates, and proceeds with template-directed 
primer extension incorporating a fluorescence-labeled nucleotide, which is then 
measured by fluorescence polarization. A total of 121 M. tuberculosis isolates 
from clinical sputum specimens were examined by this genotyping method and 
verified by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplicons harboring 
previously reported mutational sites associated with M. tuberculosis drug 
resistance. Based on phenotyping results obtained from microbiology-based drug 
susceptibility tests, the sensitivity, specificity, and test efficiency 
estimated for One Label Extension assays were respectively 83.9 %, 95.5 %, and 
92.4 % with ropB in rifampin resistance, 67.3 %, 97.1 %, and 84.3 % with rpsL 
and rrs in streptomycin resistance, 60.0 %, 96.0 %, and 91.4 % with embB in 
ethambutol resistance, 68.4 %, 94.9 %, and 86.3 % with inhA and katG in 
isoniazid resistance, and 74.1 %, 98.9 %, and 93.2 % in multiple drug resistance 
defined as resistance to at least both isoniazid and rifampin. In conclusion, 
examination of clinical sputum specimens by One Label Extension based genotyping 
provides a valid method for the rapid molecular detection of drug-resistant M. 
tuberculosis.

storage: potential roles of lipid oxidation and non-enzymatic glycosylation.

Agricultural Science, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310021, China; College of Food Science 
and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210095, 
China.

BACKGROUND: Lipofuscin-like pigments (LFLP) are considered a hallmark of aging. 
The intracellular LFLP formation rate is negatively correlated with the life 
expectancy of cell. In food quality, increase of LFLP not only affects the 
appearance but also causes loss of nutritional value.
RESULTS: The accumulation of LFLP increased during storage of all walnuts. LFLP 
fluorescent intensities of walnuts with 4%, 6%, 12% and 16% moisture at the end 
of storage were 8.1, 4.8, 4.3 and 2.8 times those at the beginning, 
respectively. The LFLP accumulation of walnuts with high moisture was found to 
be negatively correlated with soluble sugars and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl 
(DPPH) radical quenching rate, but positively correlated with the content of 
hydroxymethylfuraldehyde (HMF). While the LFLP accumulation of walnuts with low 
moisture had a strong positive correlation with anisidine value, it exhibited 
high negative correlations with acid phosphatase activity, DPPH(•) quenching 
rate and tocopherol content.
CONCLUSION: In walnuts with low initial moisture, lipoxidation products 
increased markedly during storage and these products might provide the source 
for LFLP accumulation. On the other hand, in walnuts with high initial moisture, 
reducing sugars derived from the hydrolysis of soluble sugars might play an 
important role in initiating the Maillard-like reaction, leading to LFLP 
accumulation.

are we to do?

OBJECTIVES: To examine the characteristics of those mental health clients of an 
Australian metropolitan health service who died during a 6 year period, 2005 - 
2010.
METHODS: The medical records, and where available, coronial post-mortem 
examinations were audited for 109 people with schizophrenia who died while they 
were clients of the mental health service.
RESULTS: The mean age of death for men was 45 years and for women, 47 years, 
compared to the general population's male and female life expectancy of 79 and 
84 years, respectively. About one-half of the deaths were due to suicide (n = 
55), followed by natural causes (n = 42; 39%), undetermined causes (n = 7), and 
accidents or acts of violence (n = 5). Smoking rates, diagnosed diabetes and 
hypertension were higher in the group that died from natural causes. Morbid 
obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m(2)) rates were higher in the group that 
died of natural causes (38%), compared with the suicide group (5%).
CONCLUSIONS: While suicide accounts for the majority of those dying prematurely 
in this study cohort, it appears that for those who survive the risk of suicide 
in the earlier period of a chronic psychotic illness, there is yet another 
threat to life expectancy: death from preventable cardiorespiratory disorders, 
due to a poor lifestyle and social deprivation.

BACKGROUND: Although stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, no 
comprehensive and comparable assessment of incidence, prevalence, mortality, 
disability, and epidemiological trends has been estimated for most regions. We 
used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2010 (GBD 2010) to estimate the global and regional burden of stroke during 
1990-2010.
METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, LILACS, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, 
Global Health Database, the WHO library, and WHO regional databases from 1990 to 
2012 to identify relevant studies published between 1990 and 2010.We applied the 
GBD 2010 analytical technique (DisMod-MR), based on disease-specific, 
pre-specified associations between incidence, prevalence, and mortality, to 
calculate regional and country-specific estimates of stroke incidence, 
prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost by age 
group (<75 years, ≥ 75 years, and in total)and country income level 
(high-income, and low-income and middle-income) for 1990, 2005, and 2010.
FINDINGS: We included 119 studies (58 from high-income countries and 61 from 
low-income and middle-income countries). From 1990 to 2010, the age-standardised 
incidence of stroke significantly decreased by 12% (95% CI 6-17)in high-income 
countries, and increased by 12% (-3 to 22) in low-income and middle-income 
countries, albeit nonsignificantly. Mortality rates decreased significantly in 
both high income (37%, 31-41) and low-income and middle income countries (20%, 
15-30). In 2010, the absolute numbers of people with fi rst stroke (16・9 
million), stroke survivors (33 million), stroke-related deaths (5・9 million), 
and DALYs lost (102 million) were high and had significantly increased since 
1990 (68%, 84%, 26%, and 12% increase, respectively), with most of the burden 
(68・6% incident strokes, 52・2% prevalent strokes, 70・9% stroke deaths, and 77・7% 
DALYs lost) in low-income and middle-income countries. In 2010, 5・2 million 
(31%) strokes were in children (aged <20 years old) and young and middle-aged 
adults(20-64 years), to which children and young and middle-aged adults from 
low-income and middle-income countries contributed almost 74 000 (89%) and 4・0 
million (78%), respectively, of the burden. Additionally, we noted significant 
geographical differences of between three and ten times in stroke burden between 
GBD regions and countries. More than 62% of new strokes, 69・8% of prevalent 
strokes, 45・5% of deaths from stroke, and 71・7% of DALYs lost because of stroke 
were in people younger than 75 years.
INTERPRETATION: Although age-standardised rates of stroke mortality have 
decreased worldwide in the past two decades,the absolute number of people who 
have a stroke every year, stroke survivors, related deaths, and the overall 
global burden of stroke (DALYs lost) are great and increasing. Further study is 
needed to improve understanding of stroke determinants and burden worldwide, and 
to establish causes of disparities and changes in trends in stroke burden 
between countries of different income levels.

6128, H3C 3 J7 Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Jean.lachaine@umontreal.ca.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BPD) is prevalent and is associated with a 
significant economic burden. Asenapine, the first tetracyclic antipsychotic 
approved in Canada for the treatment of BPD, has shown a comparable efficacy 
profile to other atypical antipsychotics. In addition, it is associated with a 
favourable metabolic profile and minimal weight gain potential. This study aimed 
to assess the economic impact of asenapine compared to olanzapine in the 
treatment of BPD in Canada.
METHODS: A decision tree combined with a Markov model was constructed to assess 
the cost-utility of asenapine compared with olanzapine. The decision tree takes 
into account the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the probability of 
switching to a different antipsychotic, and the probability of gaining weight. 
The Markov model takes into account long-term metabolic complications including 
diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart diseases (CHDs), and stroke. Analyses 
were conducted from both a Canadian Ministry of Health (MoH) and a societal 
perspective over a five-year time horizon with yearly cycles.
RESULTS: In the treatment of BPD, asenapine is a dominant strategy over 
olanzapine from both a MoH and a societal perspective. In fact, asenapine is 
associated with lower costs and more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). 
Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that asenapine 
remains a dominant strategy in 99.2% of the simulations, in both a MoH and a 
societal perspective, and this result is robust to the many deterministic 
sensitivity analyses performed.
CONCLUSIONS: This economic evaluation demonstrates that asenapine is a 
cost-effective strategy compared to olanzapine in the treatment of BPD in 
Canada.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer acknowledges that HPV is a human 
carcinogen affecting both sexes. This study aimed to evaluate the public health 
impact of universal HPV vaccination in Austria, to assess its cost-effectiveness 
and to estimate the HPV prevalence reduction over time. Vaccinating 65% of 
9-year-old boys and girls in Austria would result in a 70% decrease in HPV 
infections in both males and females, hereby avoiding 9500 cases of genital 
warts annually and 431 HPV 16/18-related cancers in males and females. This 
strategy would be cost effective with base case analysis of 
€26,701/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for cervical cancer only, 
€15,820/QALY also including vaginal/vulvar cancers and genital warts, and 
€10,033/QALY also considering anal, oropharyngeal and penile cancers, with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from €2500 to €21,000/QALY in 
sensitivity analyses. HPV circulation would be controlled hereby preventing 
subsequent HPV-related cancers.

The assumption according to which ill individuals can be replaced at work that 
underpins the 'friction cost method' (FCM) to value productivity costs has been 
primarily discussed within the framework of cost-utility analysis. This paper 
investigates the consequences of this assumption for cost-benefit analysis 
(CBA). It makes three contributions. First, it provides the first analytical 
account of the overall consequences of ill worker replacement on social welfare 
and it analyzes the associated compensation effects within a CBA framework. 
Second, it highlights a double counting problem that arises when ill worker 
replacement is assumed in the CBA of life-saving health care programs. To the 
best of our knowledge, no satisfactory solution to this problem has yet been 
provided in the literature. Third, this paper suggests and discusses two 
original ways to address this double counting issue. One consists in adjusting 
value of a statistical life estimations for the well-being provided by future 
incomes. Another possibility lies in the estimation of marginal rates of 
substitution between health and wealth so as to directly monetize the value of 
life over and above consumption. We show that both solutions raise unresolved 
questions that should be addressed in future research to enable appropriate use 
of the FCM in CBA.

University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of a worksite-based naturopathic 
(individualized lifestyle counseling and nutritional medicine) approach to 
primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: Economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic, multi-worksite, randomized 
controlled trial comparing enhanced usual care (EUC; usual care plus biometric 
screening) to the addition of a naturopathic approach to CVD prevention 
(NC+EUC).
RESULTS: After 1 year, NC+EUC resulted in a net decrease of 3.3 (confidence 
interval: 1.7 to 4.8) percentage points in 10-year CVD event risk (number needed 
to treat = 30). These risk reductions came with average net study-year savings 
of $1138 in societal costs and $1187 in employer costs. There was no change in 
quality-adjusted life years across the study year.
CONCLUSIONS: A naturopathic approach to CVD primary prevention significantly 
reduced CVD risk over usual care plus biometric screening and reduced costs to 
society and employers in this multi-worksite-based study. Trial Registration 
clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00718796.

Adjuvant therapy for older women with early-stage breast cancer: treatment 
selection in a complex population.

Hill, NC.

Breast cancer is a disease of aging. However, older women with breast cancer are 
less likely to participate in clinical trials or to receive recommended 
treatment. This undertreatment has contributed to a lag in breast cancer 
survival outcomes for older women compared with that for their younger 
counterparts. The principles that govern recommendations for adjuvant treatment 
of breast cancer are the same for younger and older women. Systemic adjuvant 
treatment recommendations should be offered on the basis of tumor 
characteristics that divide patients into three distinct subgroups. These 
include (1) older women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal 
growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer who should be offered endocrine 
therapy; (2) older women with HR-negative and HER2-negative breast cancer who 
should be offered adjuvant chemotherapy; and (3) older women with HER2-positive 
disease who should be offered chemotherapy with trastuzumab. Exceptions to these 
guidelines may be made for older women with small node-negative tumors or frail 
older women with limited life expectancy, where close surveillance may be a 
reasonable alternative. Addressing the current age-related disparities in breast 
cancer survival will require that older women are offered the same 
state-of-the-art-treatment as their younger counterparts, with a careful 
weighing of the risks and benefits of each treatment in the context of the 
individual's preferences. In addition, older women should be encouraged to 
participate in breast cancer clinical trials to generate additional chemotherapy 
efficacy, toxicity, and quality of life data.

BACKGROUND: The Arab world has a set of historical, geopolitical, social, 
cultural, and economic characteristics and has been involved in several wars 
that have affected the burden of disease. Moreover, financial and human 
resources vary widely across the region. We aimed to examine the burden of 
diseases and injuries in the Arab world for 1990, 2005, and 2010 using data from 
the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010).
METHODS: We divided the 22 countries of the Arab League into three categories 
according to their gross national income: low-income countries (LICs; Comoros, 
Djibouti, Mauritania, Yemen, and Somalia), middle-income countries (MICs; 
Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, occupied Palestinian 
territory, Sudan, Syria, and Tunisia), and high-income countries (HICs; Bahrain, 
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). For the whole 
Arab world, each income group, and each individual country, we estimated causes 
of death, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), DALY-attributable risk 
factors, years of life lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost due to 
premature mortality (YLLs), and life expectancy by age and sex for 1990, 2005, 
and 2010.
FINDINGS: Ischaemic heart disease was the top cause of death in the Arab world 
in 2010 (contributing to 14·3% of deaths), replacing lower respiratory 
infections, which were the leading cause of death in 1990 (11·0%). Lower 
respiratory infections contributed to the highest proportion of DALYs overall 
(6·0%), and in female indivduals (6·1%), but ischaemic heart disease was the 
leading cause of DALYs in male individuals (6·0%). DALYs from non-communicable 
diseases--especially ischaemic heart disease, mental disorders such as 
depression and anxiety, musculoskeletal disorders including low back pain and 
neck pain, diabetes, and cirrhosis--increased since 1990. Major depressive 
disorder was ranked first as a cause of YLDs in 1990, 2005, and 2010, and lower 
respiratory infections remained the leading cause of YLLs in 2010 (9·2%). The 
burden from HIV/AIDS also increased substantially, specifically in LICs and 
MICs, and road injuries continued to rank highly as a cause of death and DALYs, 
especially in HICs. Deaths due to suboptimal breastfeeding declined from sixth 
place in 1990 to tenth place in 2010, and childhood underweight declined from 
fifth to 11th place.
INTERPRETATION: Since 1990, premature death and disability caused by 
communicable, newborn, nutritional, and maternal disorders (with the exception 
of HIV/AIDS) has decreased in the Arab world--although these disorders do still 
persist in LICs--whereas the burden of non-communicable diseases and injuries 
has increased. The changes in the burden of disease will challenge already 
stretched human and financial resources because many Arab countries are now 
dealing with both non-communicable and infectious diseases. A road map for 
health in the Arab world is urgently needed.

Trends in the incidence and mortality of coronary heart disease in asian pacific 
region: the Singapore experience.

of Singapore.

The rates of coronary heart disease are lower in Asia than in developed 
countries. Singapore has undergone rapid urbanization over the past several 
decades. In the several decades between the 1960s and 1980s, a rapid increase in 
the rates of ischemic heart disease was observed, to the extent that Singapore 
exhibits one of the highest rates of mortality from cardiovascular disease in 
the Asia-Pacific region, higher even than the rates in North America. Rates of 
cardiovascular disease have now stabilized, and are declining. This is, a 
pattern that has been observed in many developed countries. Increased life 
expectancy has resulted in an epidemiologic transition that has seen chronic 
non-communicable diseases replace malnutrition and infections as the major 
causes of mortality. At the same time, there have been changes in nutrient 
intake and physical activity as well as rapid increases in the levels of several 
cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
diabetes mellitus and systemic inflammation. Furthermore, when present, there is 
a lack of awareness and sub-optimal treatment of these risk factors. In addition 
to the changes in environmental exposures related to socio-economic development, 
it does appear that specific populations are particularly prone to the 
development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. In particular, Asian 
Indians experience a high rate of coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus. 
Emerging data suggests that Chinese may be particularly prone to the adverse 
effects of obesity in relation to insulin resistance and inflammation. A 
concerted effort to change lifestyles to prevent the development of coronary 
heart disease risk factors, and to improve awareness and treatment of risk 
factors when then develop, is required to halt the epidemic of coronary heart 
disease that is occurring in Asia.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder which is 
inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. HD is caused by a trinucleotide CAG 
repeat expansion that encodes a polyglutamine stretch in the huntingtin (HTT) 
protein. Mutant HTT expression leads to a myriad of cellular dysfunctions 
culminating in neuronal loss and consequent motor, cognitive and psychiatric 
disturbances in HD patients. The length of the CAG repeat is inversely 
correlated with age of onset (AO) in HD patients, while environmental and 
genetic factors can further modulate this parameter. Here, we explored whether 
the recently described copy-number variation (CNV) of the gene SLC2A3-which 
encodes the neuronal glucose transporter GLUT3-could modulate AO in HD. 
Strikingly, we found that increased dosage of SLC2A3 delayed AO in an HD cohort 
of 987 individuals, and that this correlated with increased levels of GLUT3 in 
HD patient cells. To our knowledge this is the first time that CNV of a 
candidate gene has been found to modulate HD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we found 
that increasing dosage of Glut1-the Drosophila melanogaster homologue of this 
glucose transporter-ameliorated HD-relevant phenotypes in fruit flies, including 
neurodegeneration and life expectancy. As alterations in glucose metabolism have 
been implicated in HD pathogenesis, this study may have important therapeutic 
relevance for HD.

[Length of stay in institutionalised long-term care 1999-2011: a 
population-based study].

[Article in German]

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: From the perspective of welfare economics, 
institutionalised long-term care (ILTC) is expensive and thus requires key 
figures. This article provides the population-based mean length of stay in ILTC, 
which is a meaningful measure for monitoring purposes.
METHOD: The Sullivan method was applied to official statistics on population and 
long-term care between 1999 and 2011. This method splits up the life expectancy 
at birth into one part in and one part out of ILTC. The part in ILTC can be 
interpreted as length of stay.
RESULTS: In 2011, males in Germany experienced 5.5 months in ILTC, females 14.4 
months. In 1999, the length of stay was 3.8 and 11.8 months, respectively. Thus, 
the length of stay in ILTC has increased over time. However, the increase 
regarding women stopped in 2007. Furthermore, the onset of ILTC has been 
protracted. In 2011, the mean age at the start of ILTC was 77.6 years (males) 
and 81.7 years (females). In 1999 the mean age was 74.5 years (males) and 79.9 
years (females). In 2011, males spent 0.6% of their life expectancy in ILTC, 
females 1.4%. In 1999, this share was 0.4% (males) and 1.2% (females).
CONCLUSIONS: The utilisation of ILTC needs to be monitored by meaningful key 
figures over time. The length of stay, as proposed here, provides information on 
life expectancy and ILTC prevalence collapsed into one measure. This article 
reports the length of stay and substantiates its increase over time (in women, 
the increase ended in 2007). It is recommended to regularly update the time 
series by using official statistics.

Prehospital telemedicine electrocardiogram triage for a regional public 
emergency medical service: is it worth it? A preliminary cost analysis.

BACKGROUND: Telemedicine has been shown to improve quality of health-care 
delivery in several fields of medicine; its cost-effectiveness, however, is 
still a matter of debate.
HYPOTHESIS: Pre-hospital telemedicine electrocardiogram triage for regional 
public emergency medical service may reduce costs.
METHODS: An economic evaluation (cost analysis) was performed from the 
perspective of regional health-care system. Patients enrolled in the study and 
considered for cost analysis were those who called the local emergency medical 
service (EMS; dialing 1-1-8) during 2012 and underwent prehospital field triage 
with a telemedicine electrocardiogram (ECG) in the case of suspected acute 
cardiac disease (acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia). The prehospital ECGs were 
read by a remote cardiologist, available 24/7. Cost savings associated with this 
method were calculated by subtracting the cost of prehospital triage with 
telemedicine support from the cost of conventional emergency department triage 
(ECG and consultation by a cardiologist).
RESULTS: During 2012, the regional EMS performed 109 750 ECGs by telemedicine 
support. The associated total cost for the regional health-care system was 
€1 833 333, with a €16.70 cost per single ECG/consultation. Given the cost of 
similar conventional emergency department treatment from a regional rate list of 
€24.80 to €55.20, the savings was €8.10 to €38.40 per ECG/consultation (total 
savings, €891 759.50 to €4 219 379.50). The cost for ruling out an acute cardiac 
disease was €25.30; for a prehospital diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, 
€49.20. With 629 prehospital diagnoses of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and 
reported reductions in mortality thanks to prehospital diagnosis deduced from 
prior studies, 69 lives per year presumably could be saved, with a cost per 
quality-adjusted life year gained of €1927, €990/€ - 2508 after correction for 
potential savings.
CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital EMS triage with telemedicine ECG in patients with 
suspected acute cardiac disease may reduce health-care costs.

Funding of expensive treatments for rare (orphan) diseases is contentious. These 
agents fare poorly on 'efficiency' or health economic measures, such as the 
quality-adjusted life years, because of high cost and frequently poor gains in 
quality of life and survival. We show that cost-effectiveness assessments are 
flawed, and have only a limited role to play in reimbursement decisions for 
orphan drugs and beyond.

Cancer is the leading cause of death in older adults aged 60 to 79 years. The 
biology of certain cancers and responsiveness to therapy changes with the 
patient's age. Advanced age alone should not preclude the use of effective 
treatment that could improve quality of life or extend meaningful survival. The 
challenge of managing older patients with cancer is to assess whether the 
expected benefits of treatment are superior to the risk in a population with 
decreased life expectancy and decreased tolerance to stress. These guidelines 
provide an approach to decision-making in older cancer patients based on 
comprehensive geriatric assessment and also include disease specific issues 
related to age in the management of some cancer types in older adults.

BACKGROUND: We investigate the sex-age-specific changes in the mortality of a 
prospectively monitored rural population in South Africa. We quantify changes in 
the age pattern of mortality in a parsimonious way by estimating the eight 
parameters of the Heligman-Pollard (HP) model of age-specific mortality. In its 
traditional form this model is difficult to fit and does not account for 
uncertainty.
OBJECTIVE: 1. To quantify changes in the sex-age pattern of mortality 
experienced by a population with endemic HIV. 2. To develop and demonstrate a 
robust Bayesian estimation method for the HP model that accounts for 
uncertainty.
METHODS: Bayesian estimation methods are adapted to work with the HP model. 
Temporal changes in parameter values are related to changes in HIV prevalence.
RESULTS: Over the period when the HIV epidemic in South Africa was growing, 
mortality in the population described by our data increased profoundly with 
losses of life expectancy of ~15 years for both males and females. The temporal 
changes in the HP parameters reflect in a parsimonious way the changes in the 
age pattern of mortality. We develop a robust Bayesian method to estimate the 
eight parameters of the HP model and thoroughly demonstrate it.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in mortality in South Africa over the past fifteen years 
have been profound. The HP model can be fit well using Bayesian methods, and the 
results can be useful in developing a parsimonious description of changes in the 
age pattern of mortality.
COMMENTS: The motivating aim of this work is to develop new methods that can be 
useful in applying the HP eight-parameter model of age-specific mortality. We 
have done this and chosen an interesting application to demonstrate the new 
methods.

BACKGROUND: There is little consensus, and minimal evidence, regarding the age 
at which to stop cervical screening. We studied the association between 
screening at age 50-64 y and cervical cancer at age 65-83 y.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cases were women (n = 1,341) diagnosed with cervical 
cancer at age 65-83 y between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2012 in England and 
Wales; age-matched controls (n = 2,646) were randomly selected from population 
registers. Screening details from 1988 onwards were extracted from national 
databases. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) for different screening histories 
and subsequent cervical cancer. Women with adequate negative screening at age 65 
y (288 cases, 1,395 controls) were at lowest risk of cervical cancer (20-y risk: 
8 cancers per 10,000 women) compared with those (532 cases, 429 controls) not 
screened at age 50-64 y (20-y risk: 49 cancers per 10,000 women, with OR = 0.16, 
95% CI 0.13-0.19). ORs depended on the age mix of women because of the weakening 
association with time since last screen: OR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.08-0.14 at 2.5 to 
7.5 y since last screen; OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.20-0.36 at 12.5 to 17.5 y since 
last screen. Screening at least every 5.5 y between the ages 50 and 64 y was 
associated with a 75% lower risk of cervical cancer between the ages 65 and 79 y 
(OR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.21-0.30), and the attributable risk was such that in the 
absence of screening, cervical cancer rates in women aged 65+ would have been 
2.4 (95% CI 2.1-2.7) times higher. In women aged 80-83 y the association was 
weaker (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.83) than in those aged 65-69 y (OR = 0.12, 95% 
CI 0.09-0.17). This study was limited by an absence of data on confounding 
factors; additionally, findings based on cytology may not generalise to human 
papillomavirus testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with adequate negative screening at age 50-64 y had one-sixth 
of the risk of cervical cancer at age 65-83 y compared with women who were not 
screened. Stopping screening between ages 60 and 69 y in women with adequate 
negative screening seems sensible, but further screening may be justifiable as 
life expectancy increases.
