BACKGROUND: There is an increased need for permanent pacemaker (PPM) 
implantation for older patients with multiple comorbidities. The current 
guidelines recommend that, before implanting PPM, clinicians should discuss life 
expectancy with patients and their families as part of the decision-making 
process. However, estimating individual life expectancy is always a challenge.
AIMS: We investigated predictors of long-term survival prior to PPM implantation 
in patients aged 80 or older.
METHODS AND RESULTS: From September 2004 to September 2015, 100 patients aged 
≥ 80 years who received PPM implantation were included for retrospective 
survival analysis. The end point was all-cause mortality. Follow-up duration was 
4.0 ± 2.7 years. By the end of the study, 54 patients (54%) had died. Of the 54 
who died, 40 patients (74.1%) died of non-cardiac causes. Their survival rates 
at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 years were 90%, 76%, 54%, 32%, and 16%, respectively. 
Patients with a longer length of hospital stay before PPM implantation (LOS-B) 
[hazard ratio (HR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.05, p < 0.001], 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (HR 4.07, 95% CI 
1.95-8.52, p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) < 21 kg/m2 (HR 2.50, 95% CI 
1.16-5.39, p = 0.02), and dyspnea as the major presenting symptom (HR 2.88, 95% 
CI 1.27-6.55, p = 0.01) were associated with lower cumulative survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Longer LOS-B, lower eGFR and BMI, and dyspnea as the major 
presenting symptom are pre-PPM implantation predictors of long-term survival in 
patients aged 80 or older.

The emergence of onconephrology in recent years highlights the importance of the 
interaction between kidney disease and cancer. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
cancer are linked with each other in different ways bidirectionally: cancer can 
cause CKD, whereas CKD itself may be a risk factor for cancer. Kidney transplant 
recipients (KTRs) have a 2- to 3-fold increased cancer risk when compared with 
the general population. The elevated risk covers a wide range of cancers. Some 
are related to CKD, including cancers of the kidney, urinary tract and thyroid, 
whereas others are related to oncogenic viruses that include non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, cervical cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma. There 
is no standard protocol regarding how immunosuppressive drugs should be adjusted 
in patients who develop posttransplant cancers. However, any modification of 
immunosuppressive regimens should be balanced against the risk of allograft 
rejection or deterioration in kidney function. Cancer surveillance can be used 
as a strategy to improve the clinical outcome in KTRs. Although guidelines 
adopted in the general population have been used as the reference, a 
personalized approach based on individual cancer risk, life expectancy and 
concurrent comorbidities has to be adopted.

Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for numerous non-communicable 
diseases which dominate the overall burden of disease in Switzerland. We aimed 
to estimate the burden attributable to adult physical inactivity in Switzerland 
and its three culturally different language regions from a societal perspective 
in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), medical costs, and 
productivity losses. The burden of physical inactivity was estimated with a 
population attributable fractions (PAFs) approach. PAFs were calculated based on 
the prevalence of physical inactivity in the Swiss Health Survey and 
literature-based adjusted risk ratios of disease incidence. These PAFs were then 
applied to the total burden of the diseases related to physical inactivity. 
Physical inactivity was responsible for 2.0% (95%CI 1.7%-2.2%) of total DALYs 
lost and 1.2% (95%CI 1.0%-1.3%) of total medical costs in 2013. This is 
equivalent to 116 (95%CI 99-135) Swiss francs per capita per year. Productivity 
losses were valued at 117 (95%CI 94-142) Swiss francs per capita per year. The 
two diseases which caused the highest economic burden were low back pain and 
depression. The analysis of regional differences revealed that the per capita 
burden of physical inactivity is about twice as high in the French- and 
Italian-speaking regions compared to the German-speaking region. Reasons include 
a higher prevalence of physical inactivity, higher per capita health care 
spending, and higher disease prevalence. Cost-effectiveness analysis of related 
interventions should consider regional differences for optimal resource 
allocation in physical activity promotion policies.

S, Berges Usan P.

INTRODUCTION: The process of biological aging of people is irreversible, and 
starts virtually from birth. Health and social advances have made life 
expectancy increases exponentially, making the syndromes associated with aging 
become one of the main problems of the XXI century. Neurodegenerative diseases 
are the paradigm of chronic disabling disease. People with dementia are often 
the most regular users in the elderly care homes. They also suffer significant 
alterations in cognitive functions, and may have the so-called physiological and 
behavioural symptoms of dementia (BPSD).
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of diagnosis of dementia in the 
population of a nursing home and how many users present undiagnosed cognitive 
impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: There are a significant percentage of users who have cognitive 
impairment in diagnostic tests without being diagnosed with dementia.

PURPOSE: Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) was recently approved for treatment 
of relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) following two or 
more prior therapies. As the first CAR T-cell therapy available for adults in 
the US, there are important questions about clinical and economic value. The 
objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of axi-cel compared 
to salvage chemotherapy using a decision model and a US payer perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model was developed to estimate life years 
(LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime cost for adult patients 
with R/R LBCL treated with axi-cel vs salvage chemotherapy (R-DHAP). 
Patient-level analyses of the ZUMA-1 and SCHOLAR-1 studies were used to inform 
the model and to estimate the proportion achieving long-term survival. Drug and 
procedure costs were derived from US average sales prices and Medicare 
reimbursement schedules. Future healthcare costs in long-term remission was 
derived from per capita Medicare spending. Utility values were derived from 
patient-level data from ZUMA-1 and external literature. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. Outcomes were 
calculated over a lifetime horizon and were discounted at 3% per year.
RESULTS: In the base case, LYs, QALYs, and lifetime costs were 9.5, 7.7, and 
$552,921 for axi-cel vs 2.6, 1.1, and $172,737 for salvage chemotherapy, 
respectively. The axi-cel cost per QALY gained was $58,146. Cost-effectiveness 
was most sensitive to the fraction achieving long-term remission, discount rate, 
and axi-cel price. The likelihood that axi-cel is cost-effective was 95% at a 
willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Axi-cel is a potentially cost-effective alternative to salvage 
chemotherapy for adults with R/R LBCL. Long-term follow-up is necessary to 
reduce uncertainties about health outcomes.

This paper estimates the cost-effectiveness of a 20% price discount on healthy 
food and beverages with and without consumer nutrition education, as trialled in 
remote Northern Australia. Changes in actual store sales, from the pre-discount 
baseline period, were analysed for population impact on consumption of fruit and 
vegetables, water and artificially sweetened soft drinks, in addition with total 
dietary weight (grams), energy (Mega Joules), and sodium (milligrams). 
Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), arising from changes in dietary risk 
factor prevalence in the population, were estimated as the primary health 
outcome in a multi health-state Markov model. The costs of the strategies were 
sourced from paid invoices and time estimates of staff providing store-based 
discount promotion and consumer education. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio adopted a partial societal perspective, (including health and retail 
sector costs), as cost per DALY averted and was presented in 2011 Australian 
dollars. The price discount, helped address a gap in food price equity for 
residents of remote communities. However, the discount strategy, with or without 
consumer education led to a net loss of population health -36 95%CI (-47,-25) or 
-21(-28, -15) DALYs respectively, at increased cost to the retail and health 
sectors, of AUD860000 95%CI (710000, 1million) or AUD500000 (410000, 590000). 
The strategies trialled were thereby categorised as dominated by current 
practice while acknowledging considerable uncertainty surrounding the health 
outcome estimates. The 20% discount on limited targeted products appeared to 
need to be considered in conjunction with other marketing strategies to support 
healthy food choices, if remote Australian Indigenous population health is to be 
improved.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
tissue engineered bovine tissue pericardium scaffold (CardioCel) for the repair 
of congenital heart defects in comparison with surgery using xenogeneic, 
autologous, and synthetic patches over a 40-year time horizon from the 
perspective of the UK National Health Service.
METHODS: A six-state Markov state-transition model to model natural history of 
disease and difference in the interventional effect of surgeries depending on 
patch type implanted. Patches differed regarding their probability of 
re-operation due to patch calcification, based on a systematic literature 
review. Transition probabilities were based on the published literature, other 
clinical inputs were based on UK registry data, and cost data were based on UK 
sources and the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was determined as incremental costs per quality adjusted life years 
(QALY) gained. We used a 40-year analytic time-horizon and adopted the payer 
perspective. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: According to the model predictions, CardioCel was associated with 
reduced incidence of re-operation, increased QALY, and costs savings compared to 
all other patches. Cost savings were greatest compared to synthetic patches. 
Estimated cost savings associated with CardioCel were greatest within 
atrioventricular septal defect repair and lowest for ventricular septal defect 
repair. Based on our model, CardioCel relative risk for re-operations is 0.938, 
0.956and 0.902 relative to xenogeneic, autologous, and synthetic patches, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: CardioCel was estimated to increase health benefits and save cost 
when used during surgery for congenital heart defects instead of other patches.

CONTEXT: Little is known about the hopes patients with advanced (incurable) 
cancer have for their treatment.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe the treatment hopes of 
advanced cancer patients, factors associated with expressing specific hopes, and 
the persons with whom hopes are discussed.
METHODS: We surveyed 265 advanced cancer patients in the U.S. about their hopes 
for treatment at the baseline and after three months. We developed a taxonomy of 
hopes for treatment, which two investigators used to independently code patient 
responses. We explored associations between hopes for cure and patient 
covariates.
RESULTS: We developed eight categories of hopes. We were able to apply these 
codes reliably, and 95% of the patient's responses fit at least one hope 
category. The hope categories in order of descending baseline prevalence were as 
follows: quality of life, life extension, tumor stabilization, remission, 
milestone, unqualified cure, control not otherwise specified, and cure tempered 
by realism. Most patients reported discussing hopes with partners, 
family/friends, and oncologists; a minority reported discussing hopes with 
nurses, primary care physicians, clergy, or support groups. In logistic 
regression analysis, unqualified hopes for cure were more likely in younger 
patients and in those who did not endorse discussing their hopes with primary 
care physicians.
CONCLUSION: Advanced cancer patients harbor a range of treatment hopes. These 
hopes often are not discussed with key members of the health care team. Younger 
age and lack of discussion of hopes with primary care physicians may lead to 
less realistic hopes for cure.

PURPOSE: It is an established consensus that patients suffering from Severe 
Mental Illness (SMI) often have somatic comorbidities and a shortened life 
expectancy. In this study, we examine to what extent previously unknown 
comorbidities can be revealed if patients suffering from SMI are examined by a 
specialist in general medicine using the new clinical tool of Systematic Somatic 
Examinations of Psychiatric Patients (SSEPP).
METHODS: SSEPP is a detailed, in-depth questioning and clinical evaluation 
performed by a specialist in General medicine. A total of 112 patients were 
recruited from asylums for patients suffering from chronic and severe 
psychiatric disorders in the Copenhagen area. Diagnosis within SMI led to 106 
patients included. 6 patients had no SMI diagnosis and were excluded. Four years 
later, deaths in the cohort were registered.
RESULTS: Ninety percent of examined patients were found to have previously 
unknown indications for medical treatment. Nine deaths occurred among the 
examined patients during follow-up. All deaths happened among the 29 patients 
identified with high expected risk of ischemic manifestation (31%, p < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, SSEPP is shown to be capable of: Identifying 
previously unknown and/or undertreated somatic comorbidity in patients with SMI. 
Identifying the patients with the highest risk of ischemic manifestation with a 
score of 9 deaths/29 patients. This is statistically significant (p < .0001). 
This study suggests that patients with SMI in every psychiatric ward be 
systematically examined for somatic comorbidity by GPs especially trained with 
tools like SSEPP.

BACKGROUND: Globally 3.1 million children die each year in their neonatal period 
(first 28 days of life) according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2011 
report. Half of these surprisingly occur within the first 24 h of delivery and 
75% occur in the early neonatal period.
METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study design was carried out from 
March 2016 to April, 2016 in Damot Pulasa district, Wolaita zone, Southern 
Ethiopia to assess selected essential newborn care practices and associated 
factors among home delivered mothers in Damot pulasa district. Data were entered 
into Epi Info version 3.5.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 software for 
analysis. Multiple logistic analyses were done to control possible confounding 
variable. A P-value less than 0.05 was taken as a significant association.
RESULT: The study showed that the prevalence of essential newborn care practice 
was 24%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that variables like 
ANC visit (AOR =0.213,P = 0.015,CI = 0.102-0.446),PNC visit (AOR = 0.209, 
P = 0.00,CI = 0.110-0.399), advice about essential newborn care practice (AOR 
=0.114,P = 0.0001, CI = 0.058-0.221),urban areas women (AOR =2,P = 0.042, 
CI = 1.024-3.693), planned pregnancy (AOR = 7, P = 0.00, CI =3.732-11.813), and 
knowledge about newborn danger signs (AOR = 0.277, P = 0.006, CI = 0.110-0.697) 
were the independent predictors of ENBC practices.
CONCLUSION: Generally, coverage of essential newborn care practices was low. ANC 
visit, advice about ENBC, PNC visit, residence, planned pregnancy and knowledge 
about newborn danger signs were predictors of essential newborn care practice in 
the study area. Therefore, Health facilities should enhance linkage with health 
posts to increase ANC and PNC service utilization. Health extension workers 
should also promote and give health education about pre-lacteal feeding, early 
bathing, planned pregnancy, newborn danger signs and application of materials on 
the newborn stump.

BACKGROUND: Antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 or PD-L1 
have demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with metastatic non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). In this trial we investigated the efficacy and safety of 
avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with NSCLC who had already 
received platinum-based therapy.
METHODS: JAVELIN Lung 200 was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 
trial at 173 hospitals and cancer treatment centres in 31 countries. Eligible 
patients were aged 18 years or older and had stage IIIB or IV or recurrent NSCLC 
and disease progression after treatment with a platinum-containing doublet, an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, an 
estimated life expectancy of more than 12 weeks, and adequate haematological, 
renal, and hepatic function. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via an 
interactive voice-response system with a stratified permuted block method with 
variable block length, to receive either avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 
expression (≥1% vs <1% of tumour cells), which was measured with the 73-10 
assay, and histology (squamous vs non-squamous). The primary endpoint was 
overall survival, analysed when roughly 337 events (deaths) had occurred in the 
PD-L1-positive population. Efficacy was analysed in all PD-L1-positive patients 
(ie, PD-L1 expression in ≥1% of tumour cells) randomly assigned to study 
treatment (the primary analysis population) and then in all randomly assigned 
patients through a hierarchical testing procedure. Safety was analysed in all 
patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02395172. Enrolment is complete, 
but the trial is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between March 24, 2015, and Jan 23, 2017, 792 patients were enrolled 
and randomly assigned to receive avelumab (n=396) or docetaxel (n=396). 264 
participants in the avelumab group and 265 in the docetaxel group had 
PD-L1-positive tumours. In patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, median overall 
survival did not differ significantly between the avelumab and docetaxel groups 
(11·4 months [95% CI 9·4-13·9] vs 10·3 months [8·5-13·0]; hazard ratio 0·90 [96% 
CI 0·72-1·12]; one-sided p=0·16). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 
251 (64%) of 393 avelumab-treated patients and 313 (86%) of 365 
docetaxel-treated patients, including grade 3-5 events in 39 (10%) and 180 (49%) 
patients, respectively. The most common grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse 
events were infusion-related reaction (six patients [2%]) and increased lipase 
(four [1%]) in the avelumab group and neutropenia (51 [14%]), febrile 
neutropenia (37 [10%]), and decreased neutrophil counts (36 [10%]) in the 
docetaxel group. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 34 (9%) 
patients in the avelumab group and 75 (21%) in the docetaxel group. 
Treatment-related deaths occurred in four (1%) participants in the avelumab 
group, two due to interstitial lung disease, one due to acute kidney injury, and 
one due to a combination of autoimmune myocarditis, acute cardiac failure, and 
respiratory failure. Treatment-related deaths occurred in 14 (4%) patients in 
the docetaxel group, three due to pneumonia, and one each due to febrile 
neutropenia, septic shock, febrile neutropenia with septic shock, acute 
respiratory failure, cardiovascular insufficiency, renal impairment, leucopenia 
with mucosal inflammation and pyrexia, infection, neutropenic infection, 
dehydration, and unknown causes.
INTERPRETATION: Compared with docetaxel, avelumab did not improve overall 
survival in patients with platinum-treated PD-L1-positive NSCLC, but had a 
favourable safety profile.

Barbi et al (Reports, 29 June 2018, p. 1459) reported that human mortality rate 
reached a "plateau" after the age of 105, suggesting there may be no limit to 
human longevity. We show, using their data, that potential lifespans cannot 
increase much beyond the current 122 years unless future biomedical advances 
alter the intrinsic rate of human aging.

The problem of population aging in China has been widely documented. As a result 
of decreasing birth rates due to the Chinese one-child policy, birth rates have 
decreased dramatically, while life expectancy has increased. By 2040, it is 
expected that 24.6% of the Chinese population will be older than 65 years 
(United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 
2015), with the majority of the elderly care likely to fall to their, often, 
singleton children. Little research has been conducted, however, with this 
future generation of caregivers. This article reports on a mixed-methods study 
comparing the attitudes of the one-child generation toward the future care of 
their parents and parents-in-law, in terms of gender, sibling status, and 
urban/rural providence. It includes the results of 26 in-depth interviews with 
students aged 18 to 22 years, and a survey among 351 first-year students of a 
semiprivate university in Zhuhai (China). No differences were found for gender, 
sibling status, or urban/rural providence for the intention to take care of the 
own parents in the future, although rural and nonsingleton participants were 
more likely to mention that they intended to live close to, or with their 
parents in the future than their urban and singleton counterparts. Concerning 
the care for future parents-in-law, male students in both the survey and the 
interviews were significantly less likely to accept responsibility for their 
care than female students, but no differences were found for urban/rural 
providence or for sibling status in this respect. Finally, female and rural 
students were found to be significantly much more likely to want to live in a 
separate house than their male and urban counterparts.

Effects of glycinin basic polypeptide (GBP) on sensory and physicochemical 
properties of pork during chilled storage were investigated. Pork treated with 
GBP was analyzed periodically for sensory properties, pH, total volatile base 
nitrogen (TVB-N), α-thiobarbituric acid (TBA), and total viable count (TVC) 
values. Compared with controls, TBA values of pork treated with GBP did not 
change. TVB-N, pH, and TVC values of pork showed reductions with increasing 
concentrations of GBP during 8 days of storage. However, there were increases in 
sensory scores. TVC values of treated pork showed a positive linear relationship 
with both pH and TVB-N values. GBP at 0.16 and 0.20% efficiently inhibited 
bacterial growth, and enhanced chilled pork sensory scores. Therefore, GBP has 
potential as a pork biological preservative for extension of shelf life during 
chilled storage.

Oxidative stress contributes to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's 
disease. Phenolic antioxidants can efficiently reduce oxidative stress. In this 
study, we evaluated the effects of the freeze-drying process on phenolics, 
antioxidants, and cholinesterase inhibition in five cultivars of kiwifruits 
grown in Korea, Actinidia chinensis cv. Hort16A, cv. Happygold, and cv. Haegeum; 
A. deliciosa cv. Hayward; and A. eriantha cv. Bidan, by comparing them with 
their fresh counterparts. Among the five cultivars of both fresh and 
freeze-dried kiwifruits tested in this study, cv. Bidan had the highest levels 
of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidants, and cv. Hayward had the 
lowest. Freezedried kiwifruits inhibited acetylcholinesterase and 
butyrylcholinesterase that catalyze the breakdown of acetylcholine 
(neurotransmitter). On sensory evaluation, cv. Happygold had the highest overall 
preference scores among the freeze-dried kiwifruits. The results suggest that 
freeze-dried kiwifruit could serve as a good source of antioxidants and 
cholinesterase inhibitors.

Chitosan and chitooligosaccharides were extracted from white-leg shrimp shells 
by chemical treatment. Low molecular weight (13 kDa) and a high degree of 
deacetylation (54.83%) in chitooligosaccharides led to high water solubility 
compared to chitosan. Antimicrobial assays indicated that chitosan and 
chitooligosaccharides exhibited marked inhibitory activity against food-borne 
pathogenics, spoilage bacterial, and fungal strains tested. However, 
chitooligosaccharides revealed greater inhibitory effects than chitosan on 
tested microorganisms. The substitution of flour by chitosan or 
chitooligosaccharides in bread formulation (1 g/100 g total weight basis) showed 
antimicrobial effects against Bacillus cereus and Rhizopus sp. growth. Also, the 
fruity odor in bread containing chitosan or chitooligosaccharides was delayed. 
Interestingly, the bread containing chitooligosaccharides showed a stronger 
inhibitory effect against B. cereus and Rhizopus sp. compared to bread 
containing chitosan and control, where B. cereus and Rhizopus sp. were observed 
growing on the surface of bread after 4 days of incubation at 30 °C.

BACKGROUND: Stroke rates in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) 
who are not receiving anticoagulant therapy vary widely across published 
studies; the resulting effect on the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation in 
AF is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of variation in published AF stroke rates on 
the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation.
DESIGN: Markov model decision analysis. Warfarin was the base case, and 
non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were modeled in a secondary 
analysis.
SETTING: Community-dwelling adults.
PATIENTS: 33 434 adults with incident AF.
MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Of the 33 434 patients, 27 179 had a CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart 
failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke, and vascular disease) score of 2 
or more. The population benefit of warfarin anticoagulation for these patients 
was least using stroke rates from the ATRIA (AnTicoagulation and Risk Factors In 
Atrial Fibrillation) study and greatest using those from the Danish National 
Patient Registry (6290 QALYs [95% CI, ±2.3%] vs. 24 110 QALYs [CI, ±1.9%]; P < 
0.001). The optimal CHA2DS2-VASc score threshold for anticoagulation was 3 or 
more using stroke rates from ATRIA, 2 or more using those from the Swedish AF 
cohort study, 1 or more using those from the SPORTIF (Stroke Prevention using 
ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in atrial Fibrillation) study, and 0 or more using those 
from the Danish National Patient Registry. Accounting for lower rates of 
NOAC-associated intracranial hemorrhage decreased optimal CHA2DS2-VASc score 
thresholds, but these thresholds still varied widely.
LIMITATION: Measured benefit may not generalize to other populations.
CONCLUSION: Variation in published AF stroke rates for patients not receiving 
anticoagulant therapy results in multifold variation in the net clinical benefit 
of anticoagulation. Guidelines should better reflect the uncertainty in current 
thresholds of stroke risk score for recommending anticoagulation.

This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of 
the new Senhance robotic system (Transenterix) for robotic cholecystectomy. Our 
series is the first experience with cholecystectomies utilizing this new 
platform. From May 2017 to August 2017, 20 robotic cholecystectomies were 
performed using the Senhance robotic system. Patients were between 23 years and 
78 years of age, eligible for a laparoscopic procedure with general anesthesia, 
with no life-threatening co-morbidities that limited the subjects' 
life-expectancy to fewer than 12 months. A retrospective chart review was 
performed for a variety of pre-, peri- and postoperative data including, but not 
limited to patient demographics, intraoperative complications and postoperative 
complications. 9 male and 11 female patients were included in this study. Median 
age was 39.5 years (range 23-78); median BMI was 27.35 kg/m2 (range 22.8-48.3). 
Median docking time was 10 min (range 2-26), and median operative time was 
71.5 min (range 34-197). Conversion to standard laparoscopy occurred in one case 
for lysis of extensive adhesions. There were no conversions to open technique. 
There were no intra- or post-operative complications noted. We report the first 
series of robotic cholecystectomies using the new Senhance system. Docking time 
and total operative time decreased significantly over the course of this series 
and did not plateau; console time did not change significantly. This study 
demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing this platform in performing minimally 
invasive cholecystectomies.
