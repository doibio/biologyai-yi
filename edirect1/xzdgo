The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a phage-derived contractile nanomachine 
primarily involved in interbacterial competition. Its pivotal component, TssA, 
is indispensable for the assembly of the T6SS sheath structure, the contraction 
of which propels a payload of effector proteins into neighboring cells. Despite 
their key function, TssA proteins exhibit unexpected diversity and exist in two 
major forms, a short form (TssAS) and a long form (TssAL). While TssAL proteins 
interact with a partner, called TagA, to anchor the distal end of the extended 
sheath, the mechanism for the stabilization of TssAS-containing T6SSs remains 
unknown. Here we discover a class of structural components that interact with 
short TssA proteins and contribute to T6SS assembly by stabilizing the 
polymerizing sheath from the baseplate. We demonstrate that the presence of 
these components is important for full sheath extension and optimal firing. 
Moreover, we show that the pairing of each form of TssA with a different class 
of sheath stabilization proteins results in T6SS apparatuses that either reside 
in the cell for some time or fire immediately after sheath extension. We propose 
that this diversity in firing dynamics could contribute to the specialization of 
the T6SS to suit bacterial lifestyles in diverse environmental niches.

Torsional stress has a significant impact on the structure and stability of the 
nucleosome. RNA polymerase imposes torsional stress on the DNA in chromatin and 
unwraps the DNA from the nucleosome to access the genetic information encoded in 
the DNA. To understand how the torsional stress affects the stability of the 
nucleosome, we examined the unwrapping of two half superhelical turns of 
nucleosomal DNA from either end of the DNA under torsional stress with all-atom 
molecular dynamics simulations. The free energies for unwrapping the DNA 
indicate that positive stress that overtwists DNA facilitates a large-scale 
asymmetric unwrapping of the DNA without a large extension of the DNA. During 
the unwrapping, one end of the DNA was dissociated from H3 and H2A-H2B, while 
the other end of the DNA stably remained wrapped. The detailed analysis 
indicates that this asymmetric dissociation is facilitated by the geometry and 
bendability of the DNA under positive stress. The geometry stabilized the 
interaction between the major groove of the twisted DNA and the H3 αN-helix, and 
the straightened DNA destabilized the interaction with H2A-H2B. Under negative 
stress, the DNA became more bendable and flexible, which facilitated the binding 
of the unwrapped DNA to the octamer in a stable state. Consequently, we conclude 
that the torsional stress has a significant impact on the affinity of the DNA 
and the octamer through the inherent nature of the DNA and can change the 
accessibility of regulatory proteins.

INTRODUCTION: Only a minority of people living with mental health problems are 
getting professional help. As digitalisation moves on, the possibility of 
providing internet/mobile-based interventions (IMIs) arises. One type of IMIs 
are fully automated conversational software agents (chatbots). Software agents 
are computer programs that can hold conversations with a human by mimicking a 
human conversational style. Software agents could deliver low-threshold and 
cost-effective interventions aiming at promoting psychological well-being in a 
large number of individuals. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the clinical 
effectiveness and acceptance of the brief software agent-based IMI SISU in 
comparison with a waitlist control group.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Within a two-group randomised controlled trial, a total of 
120 adult participants living with low well-being (Well-being Scale/WHO-5) will 
be recruited in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. SISU is based on therapeutic 
writing and acceptance and commitment therapy-based principles. The brief 
intervention consists of three modules. Participants work through the 
intervention on 3 consecutive days. Assessment takes place before (t1), during 
(t2) and after (t3) the interaction with SISU, as well as 4 weeks after 
randomisation (t4). Primary outcome is psychological well-being (WHO-5). 
Secondary outcomes are emotional well-being (Flourishing Scale), psychological 
flexibility (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II), quality of life 
(Assessment of Quality of Life -8D), satisfaction with the intervention (Client 
Satisfaction Questionnaire-8) and side effects (Inventory for the assessment of 
negative effectsof psychotherapy). Examined mediators and moderators are 
sociodemographic variables, personality (Big Five Inventory-10), emotion 
regulation (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia 
Scale-20), centrality of events (Centrality of Events Scale), treatment 
expectancies (Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire) and technology alliance 
(Inventory of Technology Alliance-Online Therapy). Data analysis will be based 
on intention-to-treat principles. SISU guides participants through a 3-day 
intervention.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has been approved by the ethics committee 
of the Ulm University (No. 448/18, 18.02.2019). Results will be submitted for 
publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at the WHO International Clinical 
Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS): 
DRKS00016799 (date of registration: 25 April 2019). In case of important 
protocol modifications, trial registration will be updated. This is protocol 
version number 1.

BACKGROUND: The rapid technical development and portability of ultrasound 
systems over recent years has had a profound impact on the area of 
point-of-care-ultrasound (POCUS), both in general medicine and in obstetrics and 
gynecology. The use of POCUS enables the clinician to perform the ultrasound 
scan either at the medical office or the patient's bedside and used as an 
extension of the physical examination. Real-time images can immediately be 
correlated with the patient's symptoms, and any changes in a (critical) 
patient's condition can be more rapidly detected.
POCUS IN OBGYN: POCUS is also suitable for time-critical scenarios, and 
depending on the situation and its dynamics, the course and results of any 
therapy may be observed in real time. POCUS should be considered to be a routine 
extension of practice for most OB/GYN clinicians as it can give immediate 
answers to what could be life-threatening situations for the mother and/or baby. 
With its proven usefulness, the applications and use of POCUS should be 
incorporated in teaching programs for medical students, OBGYN residents and 
emergency physicians.

The rapid development of vaccines against COVID-19 represents a huge 
achievement, and offers hope of ending the global pandemic. At least three 
COVID-19 vaccines have been approved or are about to be approved for 
distribution in many countries. However, with very limited initial availability, 
only a minority of the population will be able to receive vaccines this winter. 
Urgent decisions will have to be made about who should receive priority for 
access. Current policy in the UK appears to take the view that those who are 
most vulnerable to COVID-19 should get the vaccine first. While this is 
intuitively attractive, we argue that there are other possible values and 
criteria that need to be considered. These include both intrinsic and 
instrumental values. The former are numbers of lives saved, years of life saved, 
quality of the lives saved, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and possibly 
others including age. Instrumental values include protecting healthcare systems 
and other broader societal interests, which might require prioritizing key 
worker status and having dependants. The challenge from an ethical point of view 
is to strike the right balance among these values. It also depends on 
effectiveness of different vaccines on different population groups and on 
modelling around cost-effectiveness of different strategies. It is a mistake to 
simply assume that prioritizing the most vulnerable is the best strategy. 
Although that could end up being the best approach, whether it is or not 
requires careful ethical and empirical analysis.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of a 
modified Individual Placement and Support intervention for people with mood and 
anxiety disorders (IPS-MA).
METHODS: Costs were assessed from a societal perspective. Health care costs were 
derived from registers and combined with data on use of IPS-MA services, 
municipal social care, and labour market services. EQ-5D was used to compute 
QALY. Missing data were imputed in a sensitivity analysis. We also computed the 
cost per gain in hours worked. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were 
computed and bootstrapped to obtain confidence intervals for QALY and gain in 
hours worked.
RESULTS: We found no difference in overall costs between groups. A significant 
saving was found in use of labour market services in the IPS-MA group. But the 
IPS-MA group had significantly lower wage earnings compared to the control 
group. The intervention group had a higher, though statistically in-significant, 
increase in QALYs than the control group. The ICER did not show statistically 
significant results, but there was a tendency, that IPS-MA could have a positive 
effect on health-related quality of life without any additional costs. However, 
participants in the IPS-MA group had a significantly lower gain in hours worked 
compared to the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a significant saving in use of labour market services, 
IPS-MA was not cost-effective. Participants in the IPS-MA group worked 
significantly fewer hours and earned significantly less than participants in the 
control group at 1-year follow-up.

Nursing).

Medical Science).

OBJECTIVES: Increased life expectancy results in greater challenges posed to 
healthcare. Concurrently, a shortage of healthcare workforce, including nurses, 
has been observed. Thus, an urgent need exists to implement improvements in 
healthcare services based on sufficient evidence. The aim of the study was to 
evaluate the influence of the relative number of nurses/midwives on life 
expectancy, and the influence of selected economic variables: gross domestic 
product (GDP), health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, and health expenditure 
per capita, on this number. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence 
of the relative number of nurses/midwives on life expectancy, and the influence 
of select economic variables: GDP, health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, 
and health expenditure per capita on this number.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis based on data from 46 countries 
was performed. Correlations between the relative number of nurses/midwives and 
life expectancy as well as economic variables were evaluated. To trace the 
differences between the countries with different relative numbers of nurses/ 
midwives, the countries were divided into groups as follows - group 1: <5 nurses 
and midwives/1000 nurses inhabitants, group 2: 5-10 nurses and midwives/1000 
inhabitants, and group 3: >10 nurses and midwives/1000 inhabitants.
RESULTS: Correlations were found between the relative number of nurses/midwives 
and life expectancy (p < 0.001, r = 0.68), and economic variables (p < 0.001, r 
= 0.82; p < 0.001, r = 0.62, and p < 0.001, r = 0.8, respectively). Life 
expectancy was higher in group 3 vs. groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.001 and p = 0.036, 
respectively), and in group 2 vs. group 1 (p = 0.006). Economic variables were 
higher in group 3 vs. group 1 (p < 0.001 for all) and group 2 (p = 0.016, p = 
0.025, p = 0.022, respectively), and in group 2 vs. group 1 (p = 002, p = 0.024, 
p = 0.002, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The relative number of nurses/midwives correlates with life 
expectancy and relies on the country's income and level of healthcare system 
financing. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2021;34(4):505-12.

INTRODUCTION: The majority of tuberculosis (TB) cases in Sweden occur among 
migrants from endemic countries through activation of latent tuberculosis 
infection (LTBI). Sweden has LTBI-screening policies for migrants that have not 
been previously evaluated. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
the current screening strategy in Stockholm.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to predict the costs and effects of the 
current LTBI-screening program compared to a scenario of no LTBI screening over 
a 50-year time horizon. Epidemiological and cost data were obtained from local 
sources when available. The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) in terms of societal cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: Screening migrants in the age group 13-19 years had the lowest ICER, 
300,082 Swedish Kronor (SEK)/QALY, which is considered cost-effective in Sweden. 
In the age group 20-34, ICER was 714,527 SEK/QALY (moderately cost-effectives) 
and in all age groups above 34 ICERs were above 1,000,000 SEK/QALY (not 
cost-effective). ICER decreased with increasing TB incidence in country of 
origin.
CONCLUSION: Screening is cost-effective for young cohorts, mainly between 13 and 
19, while cost-effectiveness in age group 20-34 years could be enhanced by 
focusing on migrants from highest incidence countries and/or by increasing the 
LTBI treatment initiation rate. Screening is not cost-effective in older cohorts 
regardless of the country of origin.

BACKGROUND: Surgical stabilization of rib fracture (SSRF) is increasingly used 
to manage patients with rib fractures. Benefits of performing SSRF appear 
variable, and the procedure is costly, necessitating cost-effectiveness analysis 
for distinct subgroups. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of SSRF versus 
nonoperative management among patients with rib fractures younger than 65 years 
versus 65 years or older, with versus without flail chest. We hypothesized that, 
compared with nonoperative management, SSRF is cost-effective only for patients 
with flail chest.
METHODS: This economic evaluation used a decision-analytic Markov model with a 
lifetime time horizon incorporating US population-representative inputs to 
simulate benefits and risks of SSRF compared with nonoperative management. We 
report quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
accounted for most plausible clinical scenarios.
RESULTS: Compared with nonoperative management, SSRF was cost-effective for 
patients with flail chest at willingness-to-pay threshold of US $150,000/QALY 
gained. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture costs US $25,338 and US 
$123,377/QALY gained for those with flail chest younger than 65 years and 65 
years or older, respectively. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture was not 
cost-effective for patients without flail chest, costing US $172,704 and US 
$243,758/QALY gained for those younger than 65 years and 65 years or older, 
respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that, under most plausible 
scenarios, SSRF remained cost-effective for subgroups with flail chest, and 
nonoperative management remained cost-effective for patients older than 65 years 
without flail chest. Probability that SSRF is cost-effective ranged from 98% 
among patients younger than 65 years with flail chest to 35% among patients 65 
years or older without flail chest.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical stabilization of rib fracture is cost-effective for 
patients with flail chest. Surgical stabilization of rib fracture may be 
cost-effective in some patients without flail chest, but delineating these 
patients requires further study.

Reconstruction of arm and hand function in patients with a cervical spinal cord 
injury can improve their quality of life. Elbow extension, wrist extension, grip 
function and opening of the hand can be reconstructed. Traditionally, this has 
been done through tendon transpositions. Nerve transfer is a new technique. A 
functioning motor nerve branch is moved and connected to a muscle or muscle 
group damaged by the spinal cord injury. This technique has several advantages. 
Multiple functions can be restored by one nerve transfer, no long-term 
hand-rehabilitation is required and there is no risk of adhesions of the 
transposition. The most important disadvantage is the recovery time, as a 
results of the slow ingrowth of the nerve transfer, which takes at least 12 to 
18 months. For each spinal cord injury patient, an individual action plan must 
be made, because not every patient has the same options and these are sometimes 
very limited.

Background. Previously, treatment of women with brain metastases following 
reproductive system cancers was palliative and included whole brain 
radiotherapy. Currently, treatment approaches have changed and life expectancy 
has increased. Nevertheless, the role of surgical treatment in these patients is 
still discussed.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate an appropriateness and role of neurosurgical care in 
the complex management of women with brain metastases following reproductive 
system cancers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 78 women with brain metastases following 
reproductive system cancer. All patients were treated at the Blokhin National 
Cancer Medical Research Center for the period 2004-2019. We have also reviewed 
the literature data for the last 30 years.
Results and discussion. Resection of brain metastases in complex treatment of 
endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer ensured favorable long-term survival in 
our material. Thus, mean life expectancy after resection of brain metastases was 
16.3 months in patients with ovarian cancer, uterine cancer - 15.6 months, 
cervical cancer - 10.25 months. Obviously, surgery is not indicated in all 
cases. However, this approach improves local control and should be used in 
combination with other treatment methods for improvement of life expectancy and 
its quality in certain patients.
CONCLUSION: Selective surgical approach should be essential in the treatment of 
patients with brain metastases following reproductive system cancer. A 
multidisciplinary approach ensures the best treatment outcomes.

МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Материал исследования составили 78 наблюдений пациенток с 
метастазами опухолей органов женской половой сферы в ЦНС, получивших лечение в 
ФГБУ «НМИЦ онкологии им Н.Н. Блохина» Минздрава России в период с 2004 по 2019 
г. Проведен анализ данных литературы по этой тематике за последние 30 лет.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Резекция церебральных метастазов в комплексе лечения рака 
эндометрия, яичников и шейки матки в нашем материале обеспечила достижение 
хороших долгосрочных результатов выживаемости. Так, при раке яичников средняя 
продолжительность жизни после удаления церебральных метастазов составила 16,3 
мес, при раке тела матки — 15,6 мес, при раке шейки матки — 10,25 мес. Очевидно, 
что хирургическое вмешательство показано не во всех случаях, но при наличии 
возможности выполнения повышает показатели локального контроля и должно 
использоваться в сочетании с другими методами лечения для улучшения качества и 
продолжительности жизни пациенток.
ВЫВОДЫ: Избирательная хирургическая тактика должна играть все большую роль в 
лечении пациенток с церебральными метастазами опухолей органов женской 
репродуктивной системы. Мультидисциплинарный командный подход обеспечивает 
наилучшие результаты лечения.

The manuscript is devoted to world experience of carotid endarterectomy and 
carotid artery stenting in advanced age patients. Some authors report the 
advantages of endovascular surgery in elderly patients while the others prefer 
carotid endarterectomy. Senile patients (75-80 years old) with asymptomatic 
internal carotid artery stenosis is one of the most difficult group for the 
management. This is due to a more complex assessment of perioperative surgical 
risk, high incidence of complicated atherosclerotic plaques in carotid arteries 
and dubious benefits of surgery considering short life expectancy and severe 
comorbidities. Accumulation of experience in the management of advanced age 
patients should be valuable for either optimizing or individualizing surgical 
strategy.

Publisher: В обзорной статье представлен мировой опыт хирургического лечения 
(каротидная эндартерэктомия и стентирование внутренней сонной артерии) у 
пациентов старших возрастных групп. В одних работах указаны преимущества 
эндоваскулярных операций у пациентов старческого возраста, в других — каротидной 
эндартерэктомии. Одними из наиболее сложных в тактическом плане являются 
пациенты старческого возраста (от 75 до 90 лет) с асимптомными стенозами 
внутренней сонной артерии. Это обусловлено более сложной оценкой 
периоперационного хирургического риска, большой частотой встречаемости 
осложненных атеросклеротических бляшек сонных артерий, сомнительной пользой 
операции из-за небольшой продолжительности жизни и отягощенного коморбидного 
фона. Накопление опыта лечения пациентов старших возрастных групп должно помочь 
либо в оптимизации, либо в индивидуализации хирургической тактики у этой 
категории больных.

Septins are GTP-binding proteins conserved across metazoans. They can polymerize 
into extended filaments and, hence, are considered a component of the 
cytoskeleton. The number of individual septins varies across the tree of 
life-yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has seven distinct subunits, a nematode 
(Caenorhabditis elegans) has two, and humans have 13. However, the overall 
geometric unit (an apolar hetero-octameric protomer and filaments assembled 
there from) has been conserved. To understand septin evolutionary variation, we 
focused on a related pair of yeast subunits (Cdc11 and Shs1) that appear to have 
arisen from gene duplication within the fungal clade. Either Cdc11 or Shs1 
occupies the terminal position within a hetero-octamer, yet Cdc11 is essential 
for septin function and cell viability, whereas Shs1 is not. To discern the 
molecular basis of this divergence, we utilized ancestral gene reconstruction to 
predict, synthesize, and experimentally examine the most recent common ancestor 
("Anc.11-S") of Cdc11 and Shs1. Anc.11-S was able to occupy the terminal 
position within an octamer, just like the modern subunits. Although Anc.11-S 
supplied many of the known functions of Cdc11, it was unable to replace the 
distinct function(s) of Shs1. To further evaluate the history of Shs1, 
additional intermediates along a proposed trajectory from Anc.11-S to yeast Shs1 
were generated and tested. We demonstrate that multiple events contributed to 
the current properties of Shs1: (1) loss of Shs1-Shs1 self-association early 
after duplication, (2) co-evolution of heterotypic Cdc11-Shs1 interaction 
between neighboring hetero-octamers, and (3) eventual repurposing and 
acquisition of novel function(s) for its C-terminal extension domain. Thus, a 
pair of duplicated proteins, despite constraints imposed by assembly into a 
highly conserved multi-subunit structure, could evolve new functionality via a 
complex evolutionary pathway.

The trace element selenium (Se) is a crucial element for many living organisms, 
including soil microorganisms, plants and animals, including humans. Generally, 
in Nature Se is taken up in the living cells of microorganisms, plants, animals 
and humans in several inorganic forms such as selenate, selenite, elemental Se 
and selenide. These forms are converted to organic forms by biological process, 
mostly as the two selenoamino acids selenocysteine (SeCys) and selenomethionine 
(SeMet). The biological systems of plants, animals and humans can fix these 
amino acids into Se-containing proteins by a modest replacement of methionine 
with SeMet. While the form SeCys is usually present in the active site of 
enzymes, which is essential for catalytic activity. Within human cells, organic 
forms of Se are significant for the accurate functioning of the immune and 
reproductive systems, the thyroid and the brain, and to enzyme activity within 
cells. Humans ingest Se through plant and animal foods rich in the element. The 
concentration of Se in foodstuffs depends on the presence of available forms of 
Se in soils and its uptake and accumulation by plants and herbivorous animals. 
Therefore, improving the availability of Se to plants is, therefore, a potential 
pathway to overcoming human Se deficiencies. Among these prospective pathways, 
the Se-biofortification of plants has already been established as a pioneering 
approach for producing Se-enriched agricultural products. To achieve this 
desirable aim of Se-biofortification, molecular breeding and genetic engineering 
in combination with novel agronomic and edaphic management approaches should be 
combined. This current review summarizes the roles, responses, prospects and 
mechanisms of Se in human nutrition. It also elaborates how biofortification is 
a plausible approach to resolving Se-deficiency in humans and other animals.

Green synthesized metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have prominent applications in 
antimicrobial packaging systems. Here we have attempted for the fabrication of 
chitosan-based nanocomposite film containing Urtica dioica leaf extract derived 
copper oxide (CuO) and zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs for shelf-life extension of the 
packaged guava fruits. Electron microscopy and spectroscopy analysis of the CuO 
and ZnO NPs exhibited nano-scale size, spherical morphologies, and negative 
ζ-potential values. The NPs possessed appreciable antioxidant and antimicrobial 
activity (AMA) in order of CuO NPs > ZnO NPs >nettle extract. Therefore, this 
work establishes for the first time the successful synthesis of CuO NPs and 
compares its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties with ZnO NPs. On 
incorporation in chitosan, the polymer nanocomposite films were developed by 
solvent casting technique. The developed films were transparent, had low 
antioxidant but substantial AMA. The NP supplementation improved the film 
characteristics as evident from the decrease in moisture content, water holding 
capacity, and solubility of the films. The nanocomposite films improved the 
quality attributes and shelf life of guava fruits by one week on packaging and 
storage compared to unpackaged control fruits. Therefore, this study 
demonstrates the higher antimicrobial potential of the nettle leaf extract 
derived CuO/ZnO NPs for development of antimicrobial nanocomposite films as a 
promising packaging solution for enhancing the shelf life of various perishable 
fruits.

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) persists as the leading cause of death in the 
Western world. In recent decades, great headway has been made in reducing 
mortality due to IHD, based around secondary prevention. The advent of coronary 
revascularization techniques, first coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 
surgery in the 1960s and then percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the 
1970s, has represented one of the major breakthroughs in medicine during the 
last century. The benefit provided by these techniques, especially PCI, has been 
crucial in lowering mortality rates in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, 
in the setting where IHD is most prevalent, namely chronic coronary syndrome 
(CCS), the increase in life expectancy provided by coronary revascularization is 
controversial. Over more than 40 years, several clinical trials have been 
carried out comparing optimal medical treatment (OMT) alone with a strategy of 
routine coronary revascularization on top of OMT. Beyond a certain degree of 
symptomatic improvement and lower incidence of minor events, routine invasive 
management has not demonstrated a convincing effect in terms of reducing 
mortality in CCS. Based on the accumulated evidence more than half a century 
after the first revascularization procedures were used, invasive management 
should be considered in those patients with uncontrolled symptoms despite OMT or 
high-risk features related to left ventricular function, coronary anatomy, or 
functional assessment, taking into account the patient expectations and 
preferences.

Aim: To assess whether the survival benefit of fruquintinib is quality-adjusted. 
Materials & methods: Data of 416 metastatic colorectal cancer patients from the 
Phase III FRESCO trial were used. The Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms or 
Toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis assessed the quality-adjusted survival benefit of 
fruquintinib versus placebo, accounting for freedom from symptomatic disease and 
from severe side effects of treatment. Results: Fruquintinib significantly 
improved patients' Q-TWiST (difference: 2.23 [1.41, 3.04] months) versus 
placebo. The Q-TWiST gain was 28.3% in the base case and ranged from 16.7 to 
39.9% in the threshold analysis, favoring fruquintinib. The Q-TWiST benefit was 
observed in fruquintinib-treated patients regardless of prior targeted therapy. 
Conclusion: Fruquintinib provides a clinically meaningful quality-adjusted 
survival benefit versus placebo as a third-line treatment for metastatic 
colorectal cancer patients.

Plain Language Summary: Lay abstract The objective of the study was to assess 
the benefit of fruqintinib, a chemotherapy drug for patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC) who do not respond well to previous chemotherapy. The 
study considered both the time of survival and the quality of life after 
patients received fruqintinib. In measuring patients’ quality of life, the study 
assessed the time that was free from cancer symptoms and any severe side effects 
from treatment. The study used data obtained from a Phase III clinical trial, 
FRESCO, which included 416 mCRC patients receiving fruqintinib or placebo. The 
results showed that fruqintinib significantly extended patients’ symptom-free 
and side effects-free survival time by approximately 2 months and 5 days. 
Fruqintinib was 16.7–39.9% more effective than placebo in extending mCRC 
patients’ high-quality life, regardless of prior targeted therapy.

Objective: To evaluate the studies which have reported the prevalence of 
maternal complications and outcomes for women with SCA/SCD. Healthy populations 
make a healthy community and improve the future for mankind. Pregnant women are 
an essential segment of humanity as they bear the fetus and supply nutrition for 
their development throughout the gestational period. Their health status and 
disease conditions also play a vital role in deciding the future of the 
offspring.Materials and methods: The Mesh terms: "Haemoglobinopathies" + "Sickle 
cell anemia" + "Sickle cell disease" + "Ethnic tribes" + "Pregnancy outcomes" + 
"India" were used to search the literature available from public databases such 
as "PubMed", "PubMed Central" "Google Scholar", "Science Direct" and "Scopus" 
and the same is checked for removing repetitions. The data was extracted and 
collected literature was thoroughly analysed. SCD/SCA is a commonly prevalent 
hereditary hemoglobinopathy disease and is related to augmented risk factors and 
premature mortality.Results: SCD severely affects pregnancy, which leads to the 
elevated occurrence of perinatal and maternal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, 
eclampsia, abortions, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), etc., and 
sufficient care during the pregnancy guarantees an improved outcome. Due to the 
best health care conveniences, availability of drugs such as hydroxyurea, 
antibiotic prophylaxis, and vaccination, the life expectancy of SCD patients has 
greatly improved in recent times though directly related to the access and 
services available at the healthcare facilities for the needy and poor. 
Moreover, the latest innovations in the fields of prenatal screening and 
preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), facilitate partners suffering from 
SCA/SCD to have a healthy child. There are no available studies on the 
prevalence of SCA/SCD in pregnant women among ethnic tribal populations from 
India.Conclusion: This review article is focused on the effects of SCA/SCD on 
pregnancy outcomes, the consistent follow-up, routine check-ups and successful 
management of complications throughout pregnancy, the various diagnostic methods 
toward preventive methods, curative and management therapeutic strategies and 
also defines the perinatal and maternal outcomes in the ethnic tribal 
populations of India.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) compared with placebo in patients with single-vessel coronary 
artery disease and angina despite anti-anginal therapy.
DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing PCI with placebo. A Markov model 
was used to measure incremental cost-effectiveness, in cost per quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) gained, over 12 months. Health utility weights were estimated 
using responses to the EuroQol 5-level questionnaire, from the Objective 
Randomised Blinded Investigation with optimal medical Therapy of Angioplasty in 
stable angina trial and UK preference weights. Costs of procedures and follow-up 
consultations were derived from Healthcare Resource Group reference costs and 
drug costs from the National Health Service (NHS) drug tariff. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of results to 
parameter uncertainty. Scenario analyses were performed to test the effect on 
results of reduced pharmaceutical costs in patients undergoing PCI, and the 
effect of patients crossing over from placebo to PCI due to refractory angina 
within 12 months.
SETTING: Five UK NHS hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: 200 adult patients with stable angina and angiographically severe 
single-vessel coronary artery disease on anti-anginal therapy.
INTERVENTIONS: At recruitment, patients received 6 weeks of optimisation of 
medical therapy for angina after which they were randomised to PCI or a placebo 
procedure.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost 
(in £) per QALY gained for PCI compared with placebo.
RESULTS: The estimated ICER is £90 218/QALY gained when using PCI compared with 
placebo in patients receiving medical treatment for angina due to single-vessel 
coronary artery disease. Results were robust under sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The ICER for PCI compared with placebo, in patients with 
single-vessel coronary artery disease and angina on anti-anginal medication, 
exceeds the threshold of £30 000 used by the National Institute of Health and 
Care Excellence when undertaking health technology assessment for the NHS 
context.Trial registration: The ORBITA study is registered with
