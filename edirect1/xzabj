OBJECTIVES: To identify the prognostic significance of positive bladder neck 
margin as the sole positive margin after radical retropubic prostatectomy for 
treatment of prostate cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from patients who underwent 
radical retropubic prostatectomy at Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1984 and 
2001. Of 164 patients with positive margins, 38 had a positive margin only at 
the bladder neck margin and 126 had a positive margin at one or more locations 
separate from the bladder neck margin.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that patients with a positive bladder neck 
margin had a greater biochemical progression risk than patients with positive 
margins at one or more locations other than the bladder neck margin. The 5-year 
actuarial risk of progression in men with positive and negative bladder neck 
margins was 69.8% and 33.0%, respectively. A positive bladder neck margin was 
statistically an independently significant predictor of progression (P = 0.001), 
along with the prostatectomy Gleason score (P = 0.0001) in the multivariate 
analysis. The hazard ratio for predicting progression for postoperative Gleason 
score and bladder neck positivity was 2.1 and 2.5, respectively. Serum 
prostate-specific antigen values, clinical stage, age, and the percentage of 
tumor at the bladder neck margin were not predictors of progression in either 
univariate or multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a positive bladder neck margin as the sole positive 
margin at radical retropubic prostatectomy have a greater risk of biochemical 
progression than patients with one or more positive margins at other locations, 
although not as adverse as the risk reported for those with Stage T4 disease.

transitional cell carcinoma.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze p27 and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) 
expression in upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with respect 
to biologic significance. p27 (p27/kip1) is involved in cell cycle control, and 
loss of p27 protein expression may result in tumor development and/or 
progression. The association of p27 with the ubiquitin ligase subunit Skp2 
targets p27 for degradation.
METHODS: A total of 53 upper urinary tract TCC specimens were investigated 
immunohistochemically using a tissue microarray technique. The immunoreactivity 
of p27 and Skp2 was analyzed with respect to associations with pT stage, grade, 
and prognosis.
RESULTS: Non-neoplastic renal tissue showed p27 immunoreactivity in tubule 
epithelium and pelvic urothelium, but lacked immunoreactivity for Skp2. In the 
TCC specimens, p27 immunoreactivity was noted in 47 (89%) of 53 cases. High p27 
expression (50% or greater of tumor cell nuclei) tended to decrease with rising 
tumor stage (14 [45%] of 31 with pT1-pT2 versus 4 [18%] of 22 with pT3; P = 
0.076), but was independent of tumor grade (11 [39%] of 28 grade 2 versus 7 
[28%] of 25 grade 3-4; P = 0.56). Skp2 immunoreactivity was noted in 32 (60%) of 
53 tumors. Skp2 expression increased with rising tumor stage (9 [41%] of 22 pT1 
versus 23 [74%] of 31 pT2-pT3; P = 0.023) and tumor grade (12 [43%] of 28 grade 
2 versus 20 [80%] of 25 grade 3; P = 0.043) and was associated with 
angioinvasion (P = 0.017). In multivariate analysis, tumor stage proved to be 
the only independent prognostic factor regarding disease-free survival.
CONCLUSIONS: p27 and Skp2 are additional biomarkers in urogenital pathologic 
findings. The statistically significant association of Skp2 expression with 
high-grade TCC, as well as the lack of expression in non-neoplastic tissue, 
suggests that Skp2 could be a promising target for future cancer therapy 
strategies.

AIM: To assess the screening rate, the cost of screening and treatment, and to 
calculate the expected epidemiological and economic gain and cost-effectiveness 
of mass-screening programme.
METHODS: The data derive from the financial database of the National Health 
Insurance Fund of Hungary from 2001. The cost of treatment includes the cost of 
outpatient care, the acute and chronic inpatient care, the subsidies of 
medicines' prices and the expenditure on disability to work (including 
sickness-pay). The expected benefits of the screening programme were modeled 
with different screening strategy and mortality decrease for a 10 years 
interval.
RESULTS: The cost of treatment of colorectal cancer was around 9.98 billion 
Hungarian forints (34 817 250 USD, 38 871 666 EUR) in 2001. In the age-group 
45-65 with 10% mortality decline 718 lives (net present value, NPV: 515), with 
20% mortality decline 1462 (NPV: 1050) lives can be saved during a 10 years 
screening programme. The cost of one life saved varies between 4.0 million 
Hungarian forints (13968 USD, 15595 EUR)/life saved and 16.3 million Hungarian 
forints (56.952 USD, 63.584 EURO)/life saved according to the mortality decline 
and screening strategy. The cost of one life year saved varies between 307 909 
Hungarian forints (1074 USD, 1200 EUR)/life year saved and 1.25 million 
Hungarian forints (4381 USD, 4891 EUR)/life years saved.
CONCLUSION: The implementation of organized colorectal screening can lead to 
cost saving in Hungary. The cost-effectiveness of colorectal screening seems to 
be acceptable for purchaser, but many methodological and organizational issues 
should be discussed in details.

Review article: patients' fears and unmet needs in inflammatory bowel disease.

The management of chronic illness is becoming increasingly patient-centred. 
Although patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a normal life expectancy, 
most individuals experience an impact of inflammatory bowel disease on their 
daily lives as well as on their attitudes, fears and beliefs. Although currently 
available therapies for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are becoming 
increasingly effective, there are still many unmet needs to address in this 
patient population. Physicians and patients' spouses or significant others 
underestimate the type and severity of problems reported by inflammatory bowel 
disease patients. Physical problems are frequently measured using disease 
activity indices. Emotional and social problems are reported using quality of 
life questionnaires and other specific measurement tools pertinent to the 
question of interest. Studies have indicated a poorer physical and emotional 
function in inflammatory bowel disease patients than in the general population. 
Effective therapies, both medical and surgical, produce significant improvements 
in the general and disease-specific quality of life. The quality of life is 
worse when the disease is more severe. Concomitant anxiety or depression appears 
to impair the quality of life even further. Common fears include the possibility 
of unanticipated flares, the need for surgery, poor energy levels and the 
side-effects of medication. Recent studies have suggested that more prominent 
patient participation in management has the potential for greater patient 
satisfaction, better outcomes and more efficient health resource utilization. 
Thus, future studies should focus not only on ensuring the wider availability of 
effective therapies, but on increasing access to health care that is tailored to 
individuals--more structure for some and more independence and self-management 
for others, with health provider supervision.

In a recent work by Dolan and Edlin, it is concluded that no link can be 
established between cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analysis 
(CEA). However, the conclusion seems to depend rather heavily on what is 
understood by a link between CBA and CEA as well as on the exact meaning of the 
latter two terms. We argue that there is at least one approach to CBA and CEA in 
which the two are very intimately linked. On the other hand, the limitations in 
the access to preference information has consequences for the kind of questions 
that can be meaningfully addressed in both CBA and CEA.

We could reasonably expect society to give at least the same weight to the 
marginal utility of the poor as to the rich, and to the marginal utility of the 
ill as compared to the healthy. Whilst Hansen et al. [Journal of Health 
Economics (2004)], may be said to link CEA and CBA within a welfarist framework, 
the assumptions they require are inconsistent with these types of ethical 
preferences. Thus, the degree to which they employ a reasonable social welfare 
function is doubtful. This paper argues that any link between CEA and CBA will 
occur not within a welfarist framework but instead within a non-welfarist one in 
which it is unlikely that CBA results could be easily transformed into 
cost-effectiveness ratios.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a common, costly, and debilitating illness. 
Resynchronization of ventricular contraction in patients with heart failure 
improves ejection fraction. The long-term morbidity and costs associated with 
such cardiac resynchronization therapy remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of cardiac 
resynchronization therapy.
DESIGN: Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation. Future costs and effects were 
discounted at 3%.
DATA SOURCES: Effects data were obtained from a concurrent systematic review. 
Health-related quality-of-life and cost data were obtained from publicly 
available data or from surveys.
TARGET POPULATION: Patients with reduced ventricular function and prolonged QRS.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: U.S. health care system.
INTERVENTIONS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy versus medical therapy.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Medical therapy yielded a median of 2.64 
(interquartile range, 2.47 to 2.82) discounted QALYs and a median discounted 
lifetime cost of 34,400 dollars (interquartile range, 31,100 dollars to 37,700 
dollars). Cardiac resynchronization therapy was associated with a median 
incremental cost of 107,800 dollars(interquartile range, 79,800 dollars to 
156,500 dollars) per additional QALY.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to changes in several 
variables, including the relative risk for death or hospitalization.
LIMITATIONS: These results apply to patients who meet the inclusion criteria of 
the currently completed trials.
CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost per QALY for cardiac resynchronization is 
similar to that of other commonly used interventions but is sensitive to changes 
in several key variables. Resynchronization therapy should not be considered in 
patients with comorbid illness that shortens life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: ACE inhibitor therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, and need for 
revascularization in high-risk patients with clinical heart failure, overt left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction, or vascular disease. In patients with clinical 
heart failure or overt left ventricular systolic dysfunction, ACE inhibitor 
therapy also reduces the risk of sudden or arrhythmia-related cardiac death. The 
objective of this study was to assess the effect of the ACE inhibitor ramipril 
on sudden unexpected death or resuscitated cardiac arrest among the 9297 
individuals without clinical heart failure or overt left ventricular dysfunction 
enrolled in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial.
METHODS AND RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 4.5 years, the composite 
outcome of unexpected death, documented arrhythmic death, or resuscitated 
cardiac arrest was reduced by 21% in patients randomized to ramipril therapy 
compared with those randomized to placebo. There were 155 (3.3%) composite 
outcome events in patients randomized to ramipril therapy compared with 195 
(4.2%) such events in patients randomized to placebo (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 
0.98, P=0.028). There were trends toward reductions in fatal primary outcome 
events (unexpected death or documented arrhythmic death; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 
1.02, P=0.072) and in nonfatal primary outcome events (resuscitated cardiac 
arrest; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.13, P=0.127) in the ramipril treatment group.
CONCLUSIONS: Ramipril reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal serious arrhythmic 
events in high-risk patients without clinical heart failure or overt left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Circulating levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a cardiac 
hormone, reflect the severity of cardiac dysfunction. Because the plasma BNP 
level changes dramatically during the period after the onset of acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI), identification of a suitable sampling time is problematic. 
There have been several reports indicating that the plasma BNP level obtained in 
the acute phase of AMI can be used as a prognostic marker. We examined whether 
the plasma BNP level measured 3 to 4 weeks after the onset of AMI represents a 
reliable prognostic marker for patients with AMI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 145 consecutive patients with AMI. Plasma BNP 
levels were measured during the 3 to 4 weeks after onset of AMI. Of those 
patients, 23 experienced fatal cardiac events during this study. The mean 
follow-up period was 58.6 months. Log BNP, left ventricular end-diastolic 
pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance were all significantly higher in the 
cardiac death group, and there were more men and more patients with a history of 
heart failure in the cardiac death group. A Cox proportional hazards model 
analysis showed that log BNP was an independent predictor of cardiac death. The 
survival rate was significantly higher in patients with log BNP <2.26 (180 
pg/mL) than in those with log BNP > or =2.26.
CONCLUSIONS: The plasma BNP level obtained 3 to 4 weeks after the onset of AMI 
can be used as an independent predictor of cardiac death in patients with AMI.

BACKGROUND: Biological age is a strong determinant of prognosis in patients with 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We sought to examine the impact of age after 
primary percutaneous coronary intervention in AMI and to determine whether 
routine coronary stent implantation and/or platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa 
inhibitors improve clinical outcomes in elderly patients after primary 
angioplasty.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In the CADILLAC trial, 2082 patients with AMI were 
randomized to balloon angioplasty, angioplasty plus abciximab, stenting alone, 
or stenting plus abciximab. No patient was excluded on the basis of advanced 
age; patients ranging from 21 to 95 years of age were enrolled. One-year 
mortality increased for each decile of age, exponentially after 65 years of age 
(1.6% for patients <55 years, 2.1% for 55 to 65 years, 7.1% for 65 to 75 years, 
11.1% for patients >75 years; P<0.0001). Elderly patients also had increased 
rates of stroke and major bleeding compared with their younger counterparts. 
Among elderly patients (> or =65 years), 1-year rates of ischemic target 
revascularization (7.0% versus 17.6%; P<0.0001) and subacute or late thrombosis 
(0% versus 2.2%; P=0.005) were reduced with stenting compared with balloon 
angioplasty. Routine abciximab administration, although safe, was not of 
definite benefit in elderly patients. Rates of mortality, reinfarction, 
disabling stroke, and major bleeding in the elderly were independent of 
reperfusion modality.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite contemporary mechanical reperfusion strategies, mortality, 
major bleeding, and stroke rates remain high in elderly patients undergoing 
primary percutaneous coronary intervention, outcomes that are not affected by 
stents or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. By reducing restenosis, however, 
stent implantation improves clinical outcomes in elderly patients with AMI.

BACKGROUND: Untreated isolated fetal complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) has 
a significant mortality rate. A standardized treatment approach, including 
maternal dexamethasone at CAVB diagnosis and beta-stimulation for fetal heart 
rates <55 bpm, has been used at our institutions since 1997. The study presents 
the impact of this approach.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-seven consecutive cases of fetal CAVB since 1990 
were studied. Mean age at diagnosis was 25.6+/-5.2 gestational weeks. In 33 
patients (92%), CAVB was associated with maternal anti-Ro/La autoantibodies. 
Patients were separated into those diagnosed between 1990 and 1996 (group 1; 
n=16) and those diagnosed between 1997 and 2003 (group 2; n=21). The 2 study 
groups were comparable in the clinical presentation at CAVB diagnosis but did 
differ in prenatal management (treated patients: group 1, 4/16; group 2, 18/21; 
P<0.0001). Overall, 22 fetuses were treated, 21 with dexamethasone and 9 with 
beta-stimulation for a mean of 7.5+/-4.5 weeks. Live-birth and 1-year survival 
rates of group 1 were 80% and 47%, and these improved to 95% for group 2 
patients (P<0.01). The 21 patients treated with dexamethasone had a 1-year 
survival rate of 90%, compared with 46% without glucocorticoid therapy (P<0.02). 
Immune-mediated conditions (myocarditis, hepatitis, cardiomyopathy) resulting in 
postnatal death or heart transplantation were significantly more common in 
untreated anti-Ro/La antibody-associated pregnancies compared with patients 
treated with steroids (0/18 versus 4/9 live births; P=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: A standardized treatment approach, including transplacental fetal 
administration of dexamethasone and beta-stimulation at heart rates <55 bpm, 
reduced the morbidity and improved the outcome of isolated fetal CAVB.

Senescence (aging) is defined as a decline in performance and fitness with 
advancing age. Senescence is a nearly universal feature of multicellular 
organisms, and understanding why it occurs is a long-standing problem in 
biology. Here we present a concise review of both evolutionary and mechanistic 
theories of aging. We describe the development of the general evolutionary 
theory, along with the mutation accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and 
disposable soma versions of the evolutionary model. The review of the 
mechanistic theories focuses on the oxidative stress resistance, cellular 
signaling, and dietary control mechanisms of life span extension. We close with 
a discussion of how an approach that makes use of both evolutionary and 
molecular analyses can address a critical question: Which of the mechanisms that 
can cause variation in aging actually do cause variation in natural populations?

About 30 million people in Africa are estimated to be living with human 
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), yet data 
about the natural history of infection on the continent are sparse. We reviewed 
the literature on the natural history of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections among 
African adults. Only one study, conducted in rural Uganda, has reported on 
survival from the time of HIV-1 seroconversion: the median was 9.8 years, which 
is similar to that reported in developed countries in the early stages of the 
epidemic and consistent with the findings from the follow-up of individuals 
identified by serological testing during community-based prevalence studies from 
Africa. Progression to symptomatic disease was faster in Uganda than in 
developed countries, due largely to the high background level of morbidity. 
Various studies suggest that people infected with HIV-2 survive longer and the 
course of the disease is possibly more variable than in people infected with 
HIV-1. However no studies have investigated survival from time of seroconversion 
among people infected with HIV-2. The majority of patients in hospital in Africa 
with either HIV-1 or HIV-2 have the clinical features of AIDS just before they 
die, and many are severely immunosuppressed. This is similar to the situation in 
developed countries before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (HAART). Potentially preventable infections are the leading causes of 
death among individuals infected with HIV-1. Prophylactic regimens and better 
treatments could have some effect on survival, but major improvements in life 
expectancy will require HAART.

Pramipexole v. levodopa as initial treatment for Parkinson's disease: a 
randomized clinical-economic trial.

School of Medicine, Rochester, New York, USA.

PURPOSE: To determine the 2-year incremental cost effectiveness of initial 
pramipexole treatment compared with initial levodopa treatment in patients with 
early Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: 301 subjects with early PD were randomized to either pramipexole or 
levodopa and followed every 3 months over a 2-year period. Costs were assigned 
to patient collected health utilization data using a variety of methods. Health 
state preferences were estimated using the EuroQol.
RESULTS: Pramipexole strategy was an estimated 2,138 dollars (SE = 1,182 
dollars) more expensive than levodopa strategy. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness of pramipexole compared with levodopa was 106,900 
dollars/QALY (EQ-5D), compared with pramipexole being dominated by levodopa 
using the EQVAS.
CONCLUSIONS: Although considerable uncertainty exists in the 2-year 
cost-effectiveness of initial pramipexole compared with initial levodopa in the 
treatment of early PD, our estimates suggest that pramipexole may not be welfare 
enhancing during the first 2 years of treatment. If initial pramipexole results 
in long-term improvements in quality of life, its cost-effectiveness will become 
more favorable.

The cost-effectiveness of screening programs using single and multiple birth 
cohort simulations: a comparison using a model of cervical cancer.

Dewilde S(1), Anderson R.

Author information:
(1)MEDTAP International Inc., London, UK.

Despite early recognition of the theoretical advantages of simulations that 
include different population subgroups/ strata and different birth cohorts, many 
modeling-based economic evaluations of cervical screening have been based on 
unrealistic single birth cohort simulations. The authors examined the effect of 
a multiple birth cohort simulation on the incremental cost-effectiveness 
estimates of cervical screening programs, compared to a conventional single 
cohort simulation. The choice of hypothetical cohort that starts the simulation 
had a major impact on the cost-effectiveness estimates: Compared with a single 
birth cohort simulation, the incremental cost-effectiveness of a shift from 
biennial to triennial screening was 30% higher when using the multiple cohort 
simulation. Multiple cohort simulations using the different age structures of 4 
countries had little impact on the cost effectiveness ratios (variation <5%). 
Future modeling-based evaluations of screening policies should better reflect 
the age range of the population that is targeted by carefully specifying the 
nature of the starting cohort(s).

Comment in
    Med Decis Making. 2004 Sep-Oct;24(5):536-7.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of preference assessment method on treatment 
recommended by an individualized decision-analytic model for early prostate 
cancer.
METHODS: Health state preferences were elicited by time tradeoff, rating scale, 
and a power transformation of the rating scale from 63 men ages 55 to 75. The 
authors used these values in a Markov model to determine whether radical 
prostatectomy or watchful waiting yielded the greater quality-adjusted life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: Time tradeoff and transformed rating scale recommendations differed 
widely. Time tradeoff and transformed rating scale utilities differed in their 
treatment recommendation for 21% to 52% of men, and the mean difference in 
quality-adjusted life years varied from less than 0.5 to greater than 1.0.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment recommendations from the prostate cancer decision model 
were sensitive to the method of preference assessment. If decision analysis is 
used to counsel individual patients, careful consideration must be given to the 
method of preference elicitation.

Correcting biases in standard gamble and time tradeoff utilities.

The standard gamble (SG) method and the time tradeoff (TTO) method are commonly 
used to measure utilities. However, they are distorted by biases due to loss 
aversion, scale compatibility, utility curvature for life duration, and 
probability weighting. This article applies corrections for these biases and 
provides new data on these biases and their corrections. The SG and TTO 
utilities of 6 rheumatoid arthritis health states were assessed for 45 healthy 
respondents. Various corrections of utilities were considered. The uncorrected 
TTO scores and the corrected (for utility curvature) TTO scores provided similar 
results. This article provides arguments suggesting that the TTO scores are 
biased upward rather than having balanced biases. The only downward bias in TTO 
scores was small and probably cannot offset the upward biases. TheTTOscores are 
higher than the theoretically most preferred correction of the SG, the mixed 
correction. These findings suggest that uncorrected SG scores, which are higher 
than TTO scores, are too high.

The death of Bernie O'Brien in February 2004 brought a premature end to one of 
the most productive and influential careers in the area of health technology 
assessment and economic evaluation. A long-term member of the Society for 
Medical Decision Making, Bernie will be remembered for his research 
contributions in areas including outcome valuation, decision modeling, 
statistical methods in economic evaluation, and applied cost-effectiveness 
studies. He was also an excellent communicator and teacher and, above all, a fun 
guy to work with. In this article, the authors provide a review of Bernie's 
academic contributions.

Indicators for chronic disease surveillance.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Council of State and Territorial 
Epidemiologists; Association of State and Territorial Chronic Disease Program 
Directors.

Chronic diseases account for seven of the 10 leading causes of death in the 
United States, including the three leading causes of preventable death (tobacco 
use, improper diet and physical inactivity, and alcohol use). Seventy percent of 
health-care costs in the United States are for chronic diseases. In 1999, to 
allow public health officials to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic 
disease data, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists released 
Indicators for Chronic Disease Surveillance. The report provided standard 
definitions for 73 indicators developed by epidemiologists and chronic disease 
program directors at the state and federal level. The indicators were selected 
because of their importance to public health and the availability of state-level 
data. This report describes the latest revisions to the chronic disease 
indicators. The revised set of 92 indicators includes 63 indicators that were 
unchanged from the first edition, six that have been revised, and 23 that are 
new. Four indicators from the first edition were deleted. Of the indicators, 24 
are for cancer; 15 for cardiovascular disease; 11 for diabetes; seven for 
alcohol; five each for nutrition and tobacco; three each for oral health, 
physical activity, and renal disease; and two each for asthma, osteoporosis, and 
immunizations. The remaining 10 indicators cover such overarching conditions as 
poverty, education, life expectancy, and health insurance. Additional 
information regarding the indicators for chronic disease surveillance is 
available at http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/cdi.

Risk assessment in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).

University, Düsseldorf, Germany. Germing@med.uni-duesseldorf.de

The clinical course of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is extremely 
variable, and disease progression can occur at any time from diagnosis. Median 
survival is about 20 months. About 20% of patients develop acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML). Multivariate analyses performed by several groups showed that 
elevated medullary blast count, low haemoglobin, elevated serum lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), and perhaps an increased lymphocyte count, are the most 
important independent prognostic parameters, whereas karyotype analysis was not 
consistently shown to yield additional prognostic information. Applying 
different scoring systems to 288 CMML patients included in the Düsseldorf MDS 
Registry, we found that the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) was 
not useful for defining risk groups in CMML, while the Spanish Score, the 
modified Bournemouth Score, the Düsseldorf Score, and probably the MDAP Score, 
identified patient groups differing significantly in survival. These scores 
should therefore be employed for clinical decision making and for risk 
stratification in the context of clinical trials.

Distribution and prognosis of WHO lymphoma subtypes in Taiwan reveals a low 
incidence of germinal-center derived tumors.

Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.

To assess the distribution of lymphomas in Taiwan according to the WHO (World 
Health Organization) classification, 175 recently diagnosed cases of malignant 
lymphomas were studied and the clinicopathologic data were analyzed. B-cell 
lymphomas accounted for 57.1% of cases, T-cell lymphomas 38.9%, and Hodgkin's 
lymphoma 4%. Extranodal lymphomas predominated (55.4%). The most common subtype 
of B-cell lymphoma was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (33.1%). All tumor types 
believed to be derived from germinal center (GC) B-cells including follicular 
lymphoma (4.6%), Burkitt lymphoma (1.7%), Hodgkin lymphoma (4.0%), and GC-like 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (as defined by combined expression of bc1-6 and 
CD10) were rather uncommon as compared to frequencies seen in series from 
Western countries. The common T-cell lymphomas included nasal and extranasal 
NK/T cell lymphoma (7.4%), mycosis fungoides (7.4%), and unspecified peripheral 
T-cell lymphoma (6.9%). Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma was very uncommon and 
accounts for only 0.6%. The proportional increase in T-cell lymphomas that were 
unrelated to type I human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) may be linked to 
differential Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oncogenesis. The survival data revealed 
that mantle cell lymphoma, NK/T-cell lymphoma, unspecified peripheral T-cell 
lymphoma, and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma had an aggressive 
course. Our results confirm the utility of the WHO classification scheme for 
prognostic stratification and further highlight the distinctive distribution 
pattern of malignant lymphoma in Taiwan including the higher relative incidence 
of T cell lymphomas and the rarity of germinal center-derived B-cell tumors.

The role of adjuvant radiotherapy to sites of nodal bulky disease in patients 
with aggressive diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), and stage IV remain 
undefined. We began a prospective controlled clinical trial to evaluate impact 
in event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in a large cohort of 
patients with a longer follow-up. Between 1989 and 1995; 341 patients with 
aggressive DLCL and presence of nodal bulky disease (tumor mass > 10 cm) in 
pathological proven complete response after intensive chemotherapy were 
randomized to received either radiotherapy (involved fields, 40 Gy) or not. The 
5-year EFS and OS in radiated patients were respectively: 82% (95% Confidence 
interval (CI): 70-89%) and 87% (95% 80-99%), that were statistically significant 
to control group: 55% (41-64%) (P < 0.001) and 66% (95% CI: 51-73%) (P < 0.01) 
respectively. Radiotherapy was well tolerated, acute toxicity was mild and until 
now late toxicity did not appear. The use of adjuvant radiotherapy improve EFS 
and OS and probably the possibility of cure in patients diffuse large cell 
lymphoma with worse prognostic factors. Thus, we felt that adjuvant radiotherapy 
will be considered as part of the initial treatment in this setting of patients.

We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 94 consecutive elderly patients 
treated at our center for an aggressive lymphoma without a low-grade component. 
Median survival was 26 months and 5-year overall survival was 39% (27-50%). We 
then evaluated the outcome of patients refractory to or relapsing after CHOP or 
CHOP-like chemotherapy. Twenty patients were refractory to first-line therapy 
and only 1/20 is alive with active lymphoma. Eight patients achieved a partial 
response and only 3 maintained the partial response while the other 5 patients 
died. Only 2 of the 27 patients who relapsed after a first complete remission 
achieved a second sustained complete remission. This study suggests that 
conventional-dose second-line chemotherapy yields disappointing results in 
elderly patients with aggressive lymphomas.

Lymphoma is a malign disease of the lymphoid system. A variety of risk factors 
have been described in pathogenesis of disease. We investigated the role of 
Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) in malign lymphomas. A total of 52 patients who were 
admitted to the Oncology Unit of Mersin University with histologically diagnosed 
lymphoma were enrolled to this study. Ten of the patients had Hodgkin's disease 
(HD), and 42 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). An immunuhistochemical method was 
used for Cox-2 expression. Cox-2 expression was detected in 24 of the 42 
patients (57%) with NHL, and it was found in seven of the 10 patients (70%) with 
HD. The mean patient age expressing Cox-2 was 50.2+/-16.6 years and 48.0+/-15.5 
years for patients without Cox-2 expression. This difference was not 
statistically significant (P = 0.660). The overall survival of Cox-2-positive 
patients was less than for those without Cox-2 expression but the difference was 
not significant statistically (16.4+/-11.4 vs. 14.7+/-8.2 months, respectively, 
P = 0.552) in NHL. There was a correlation between Cox-2 and stage of disease. 
As the stage increased the Cox-2 expression increased (P = 0.037) in NHL. The 
complete response rate to therapy was significantly higher in Cox-2-negative 
patients than the Cox-2-positive group (70.6% vs. 20.8%, respectively, P = 
0.001) in NHL. There was no correlation between Cox-2 expression and IPI score, 
extranodal involvement, tumor grade, and B symptoms. Our findings demonstrate 
that there is a clinical correlation between the Cox-2 expression and prognostic 
factors in lymphoma patients. The combination of Cox-2 inhibitors with standard 
chemotherapeutics may enhance the potential of treatment options for malign 
lymphomas.

Frequency and impact of high-resolution monitor failure in a filmless imaging 
department.

Siegel EL(1), Reiner BI, Cadogan M.

Author information:
(1)University of Maryland School of Medicine and the VA Maryland Health Care 
System, Baltimore, MD, USA.

The purpose of this study was to assess the image quality and the rate of 
failure of the high-resolution (2,048 x 1536 pixel) monitors used for primary 
diagnosis in a filmless radiology department and to analyze the type of problems 
encountered as well as the action taken to repair the monitors. Data were 
collected from Picture Archival and Communication System (PACS) service logs to 
determine rates of monitor adjustment and replacement, the symptoms reported, 
and the action taken. Additionally, random surveys of the high-resolution 
monitors were performed using a standard test pattern to assess spatial and 
contrast resolution in the center and outer corners of the monitors. Analysis of 
monitor service records showed a high rate of monitor replacement (41% per year) 
resulting in a relatively short "life expectancy" (defined as average time 
required before replacement) of 2.4 years. Random surveys of monitor quality 
using a standard test pattern showed suboptimal image quality in approximately 
54% of the monitors with moderate image quality degradation present in at least 
one region of 27% of the high-resolution monitors, despite our vendor's quality 
control program. The results of this study support our subjective impression and 
those of other colleagues in the PACS community of an unacceptably high monitor 
failure rate and persistent image quality problems with 2,000 pixel monitors 
used for primary diagnosis. The relatively high incidence of suboptimal quality 
monitors suggests that more frequent quality control should be performed using a 
test pattern particularly given the fact that radiologists often are unable to 
discern degradation of monitor performance using clinical images. The high 
incidence of problems with image quality on high-resolution monitors indicates 
that vendors need to develop better quality control in monitor design and 
testing. Radiologists should review briefly a test pattern on each monitor at 
the beginning of each day. A computer program should be incorporated into the 
PACS, which asks radiologists to evaluate a test pattern and records the results 
in a central database, which is communicated to the service engineers. Further 
studies should be evaluated to determine the clinical impact of monitor image 
degradation, which is relatively easily seen using a test pattern but may be 
difficult to discern on clinical images. Requests for proposals (RFPs) for PACS 
and service contracts must specify carefully requirements for monitor image 
quality and conditions under which the vendor is required to replace these 
monitors.

This article was derived from my memorial talk given when receiving the prize of 
the Japanese Society for Hygiene at their academic congress. The reader could 
review my research on health and welfare promotion made by introducing new 
conceptual health policy based on the approach of social medicine. Through my 
experience in different research work, the importance of social factors in the 
etiology of health during childhood, adulthood and old age was discussed. In 
addition, it was revealed that social factors not only influence the 
population's health status but also constitute the context within which 
organized efforts can be made to promote health. For the elderly, the annual 
health check, stroke patient registration, and insurance for care and spousal 
bereavement; for adults, the Karoshi and occupational health; and for children, 
air pollution-atopy predisposition and lifestyles were highlighted as social 
medicine-related issues. The research on mostly longitudinal population studies 
showed that health status, including the life expectancy and the prevalence of 
disability and chronic disorders, are related to one's marital status, social 
support, psychosocial working conditions and environmental factors as well as to 
lifestyles such as physical activity and hours of work and sleep at entry. More 
attention should be directed to independent factors' effects on health, separate 
from those of adverse health habits and bio-medical situations, under the health 
and welfare promotion strategy.
