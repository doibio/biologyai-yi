OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the global spatial prevalence and temporal trends 
of the burden of low bone mineral density (LBMD) worldwide, due to a lack of 
related studies.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: We used data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 to conduct 
this study. LBMD in the GBD study includes both osteopenia and osteoporosis. The 
estimation for the prevalence, measured by the summary exposure value (SEV), and 
burden of LBMD was made in DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. 
Correlation analysis was performed using the Spearman rank order correlation 
methods. The temporal trends were represented by the estimated annual percentage 
change (EAPC).
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 438 thousand deaths and 16.6 million DALYs 
attributable to LBMD, increasing by 111.1% and 93.8% respectively, compared to 
that in 1990. From 1990 to 2019, the prevalence of LBMD has decreased worldwide, 
but has increased in high-income North America. Some countries, such as the 
United States, Australia, Canada, and China had increased disability and 
mortality rates of LBMD with time. Countries with low socio-demographic index 
(SDI) had higher incidence and mortality rate than those with high SDI. The 
prevalence of LBMD was lower in males, but the attributable disability and 
mortality were higher in males in all years from 1990 to 2019.
CONCLUSION: With population aging, countries worldwide, especially those with 
low-SDI, will face increasing challenges in reducing the burden attributable to 
LBMD and osteoporosis. The treatment of osteoporosis has been overlooked in men 
for a long time. Effective measures are warranted to control the prevalence and 
burden of LBMD.

Secretome is involved in almost all physiological, developmental, and 
pathological processes, but to date there is still a lack of highly-efficient 
research strategy to comprehensively study the secretome of invertebrates. 
Adhesive secretion is a ubiquitous and essential physiological process in 
aquatic invertebrates with complicated protein components and unresolved 
adhesion mechanisms, making it a good subject for secretome profiling studies. 
Here we proposed a computational pipeline for systematic profiling of byssal 
secretome based on spatiotemporal transcriptomes of scallop. A total of 186 
byssus-related proteins (BRPs) were identified, which represented the first 
characterized secretome of scallop byssal adhesion. Scallop byssal secretome 
covered almost all of the known structural elements and functional domains of 
aquatic adhesives, which suggested this secretome-profiling strategy had both 
high efficiency and accuracy. We revealed the main components of scallop byssus 
(including EGF-like domain containing proteins, the Tyr-rich proteins and 
4C-repeats containing proteins) and the related modification enzymes primarily 
contributing to the rapid byssus assembly and adhesion. Spatiotemporal 
expression and co-expression network analyses of BRPs suggested a simultaneous 
secretion pattern of scallop byssal proteins across the entire region of foot 
and revealed their diverse functions on byssus secretion. In contrast to the 
previously proposed "root-initiated secretion and extension-based assembly" 
model, our findings supported a novel "foot-wide simultaneous secretion and in 
situ assembly" model of scallop byssus secretion and adhesion. Systematic 
analysis of scallop byssal secretome provides important clues for understanding 
the aquatic adhesive secretion process, as well as a common framework for 
studying the secretome of non-model invertebrates.

BACKGROUND: Telomere length is associated with risk of several age-related 
diseases and cancers. We aimed to investigate the extent to which telomere 
length might be modifiable through lifestyle and behaviour, and whether such 
modification has any clinical consequences.
METHODS: In this population-based study, we included participants from UK 
Biobank who had leukocyte telomere length (LTL) measurement, ethnicity, and 
white blood cell count data. We investigated associations of LTL with 117 
potentially modifiable traits, as well as two indices of healthy behaviours 
incorporating between them smoking, physical activity, diet, maintenance of a 
healthy bodyweight, and alcohol intake, using both available and imputed data. 
To help interpretation, associations were summarised as the number of equivalent 
years of age-related change in LTL by dividing the trait β coefficients with the 
age β coefficient. We used mendelian randomisation to test causality of selected 
associations. We investigated whether the associations of LTL with 22 diseases 
were modified by the number of healthy behaviours and the extent to which the 
associations of more healthy behaviours with greater life expectancy and lower 
risk of coronary artery disease might be mediated through LTL.
FINDINGS: 422 797 participants were available for the analysis (227 620 [53·8%] 
were women and 400 036 [94·6%] were White). 71 traits showed significant 
(p<4·27 × 10-4) associations with LTL but most were modest, equivalent to less 
than 1 year of age-related change in LTL. In multivariable analyses of 17 traits 
with stronger associations (equivalent to ≥2 years of age-related change in 
LTL), oily fish intake, educational attainment, and general health status 
retained a significant association of this magnitude, with walking pace and 
current smoking being additionally significant at this level of association in 
the imputed models. Mendelian randomisation analysis suggested that educational 
attainment and smoking behaviour causally affect LTL. Both indices of healthy 
behaviour were positively and linearly associated with LTL, with those with the 
most healthy behaviours having longer LTL equivalent to about 3·5 years of 
age-related change in LTL than those with the least heathy behaviours (p<0·001). 
However, healthy behaviours explained less than 0·2% of the total variation in 
LTL and did not significantly modify the association of LTL with risk of any of 
the diseases studied. Neither the association of more healthy behaviours on 
greater life expectancy or lower risk of coronary artery disease were 
substantially mediated through LTL.
INTERPRETATION: Although several potentially modifiable traits and healthy 
behaviours have a quantifiable association with LTL, at least some of which are 
likely to be causal, these effects are not of a sufficient magnitude to 
substantially alter the association between LTL and various diseases or life 
expectancy. Attempts to change telomere length through lifestyle or behavioural 
changes might not confer substantial clinical benefit.

BACKGROUND: Urolithiasis is common worldwide and can predispose to urinary tract 
infections and renal failure. We aimed to explore the global, regional, and 
national burden of urolithiasis between 1990 and 2019, stratified by sex, age, 
and sociodemographic index (SDI).
METHODS: From 1990 to 2019, data on the number of incident cases of 
urolithiasis, associated deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were 
extracted from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. The trends for the 
incidence rate, mortality, and DALYs were evaluated using estimated annual 
percentage changes (EAPCs).
RESULTS: The incidence of urolithiasis increased by 48.57%, from 77.78 million 
incident cases in 1990 to 115.55 million in 2019, while its age-standardized 
incidence rate (ASIR) decreased. The ASIR increased slightly in the low SDI 
regions (EAPC = 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24-0.43), while ASIRs in 
other SDI regions decreased. The incidence of urolithiasis by age presented a 
unimodal distribution, with the peak observed in patients aged between 50 years 
and 70 years. Urolithiasis-related mortality and DALYs also increased over time. 
Yet, the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) decreased by 2.05% (95% CI, -2.25% 
to -1.85%) per year, and the annual age-standardized DALY rate decreased by 
1.77% (95% CI, -1.92% to -1.63%). The mortality and DALYs increased with age. 
The incidence, mortality, and DALYs were greater in males than those in females. 
The burden of urolithiasis showed obvious differences in its regional 
distribution over the past three decades.
CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2019, ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardized DALY rate of 
urolithiasis have decreased. Yet, particularly significant differences exist in 
the geographic, age, and sex distribution. Thus, medical resources should be 
rationally allocated and adjusted according to the geographic and demographic 
distribution of urolithiasis.

Due to the increase in life expectancy worldwide, age-related disorders such as 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) have become more prevalent. Conventional 
treatments comprise drugs that only attenuate some of the symptoms, but fail to 
arrest or delay neuronal proteotoxicity that characterizes these diseases. Due 
to their diverse biological activities, imidazole rings are intensively explored 
as powerful scaffolds for the development of new bioactive molecules. By using 
C. elegans, our work aims to explore novel biological roles for these compounds. 
To this end, we have tested the in vivo anti-proteotoxic effects of imidazolium 
salts. Since NDs have been largely linked to impaired antioxidant defense 
mechanisms, we focused on 1-Mesityl-3-(3-sulfonatopropyl) imidazolium (MSI), one 
of the imidazolium salts that we identified as capable of improving iron-induced 
oxidative stress resistance in wild-type animals. By combining mutant and gene 
expression analysis we have determined that this protective effect depends on 
the activation of the Heat Shock Transcription Factor (HSF-1), whereas it is 
independent of other canonical cytoprotective molecules such as abnormal Dauer 
Formation-16 (DAF-16/FOXO) and Skinhead-1 (SKN-1/Nrf2). To delve deeper into the 
biological roles of MSI, we analyzed the impact of this compound on previously 
established C. elegans models of protein aggregation. We found that MSI 
ameliorates β-amyloid-induced paralysis in worms expressing the pathological 
protein involved in Alzheimer's Disease. Moreover, this compound also delays 
age-related locomotion decline in other proteotoxic C. elegans models, 
suggesting a broad protective effect. Taken together, our results point to MSI 
as a promising anti-proteotoxic compound and provide proof of concept of the 
potential of imidazole derivatives in the development of novel therapies to 
retard age-related proteotoxic diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To screen and identify key genes as potential biomarkers of lung 
cancer using bioinformatics analysis.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Critical Care Medicine, the First 
Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, 
China, from August 2018 to April 2021.
METHODOLOGY: Independent microarray datasets (GSE85841 and GSE118370) were 
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using GEO2R. Cytohubba was 
employed to identify the hub genes. Cellular component analysis, hierarchical 
clustering, and survival analyses of hub genes were performed via BiNGO, UCSC, 
and cBioPorta. A series of analyses of FGF2 and PIK3R1 were conducted using 
Oncomine.
RESULTS: A total of 463 DEGs were identified and 11 hub genes were determined. 
BDNF, FGF2, JAK2, NCAM1, CAV1, TJP1, and PIK3R1 may affect the survival 
probability and life expectancy of lung cancer patients, but the p-values were 
not statistically significant. FGF2 and PIK3R1 had the highest node degrees, 40 
and 32 respectively. The expression of FGF2 and PIK3R1 were significantly lower 
in the 4 lung cancer data sets compared with non-lung cancer tissues. And the 
low expression of FGF2 and PIK3R1 is related to tumor grades, family history of 
cancer, multiple tumors present, and prior therapy of lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: Evaluation of FGF2 and PIK3R1 as potential biomarkers can contribute 
to the subsequent theoretical analysis of potential molecular mechanisms and 
development of lung cancer, so that the diagnosis of lung cancer may be more 
accurate, and it is possible to provide therapeutic and prognostic medicine 
targets.

BACKGROUND: Extranodal extension (ENE) is an established prognostic factor in 
several gastrointestinal cancers. However, the prognostic impact remains 
unclear. Here, we investigated the prognostic implications of ENE in patients 
with surgically resected pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 476 surgically resected pancreatic head 
cancer patients who consecutively underwent upfront pancreaticoduodenectomy for 
pathologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma between January 2009 
and December 2013. We compared the disease-free survival (DFS) rates of the 
patients according to ENE status.
RESULTS: Among the 476 patients, patients with ENE had lower DFS rates than 
those without ENE (N0, 13 months; LN+/ENE-, 7 months; LN+/ENE+, 6 months; 
P < .001). In addition, even in the same N stage, patients with ENE had lower 
DFS rates than those without ENE (N0, 13 months; N1/ENE- 8 months; N1/ENE+, 
7 months; N2/ENE-, 7 months; N2/ENE+, 4 months, P < .001). However, there was no 
significant difference in survival rates between patients in the N1/ENE+ group 
and those in the N2/ENE- group. Additionally, ENE was an independent prognostic 
factor for pancreatic cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Extranodal extension significantly predicted a poor prognosis among 
patients with pancreatic head cancer, especially those with nodal metastasis. 
Therefore, ENE should be considered a prognostic factor in future editions of 
the staging system.

OBJECTIVE: People living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) are experiencing growing 
co-morbidities due to an increase in life expectancy and the use of long-term 
antiretroviral therapy (ART). The lack of integrated non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs) screening and management at the HIV care and treatment centres (CTCs) 
make it difficult to determine the trends of NCD co-morbidity among patients 
with HIV. This study aimed to assess the burden and determinants of common NCDs, 
including depression among patients with HIV.
METHODS: Analytical cross-sectional study of 1318 HIV patients enrolled using 
systematic random sampling conducted from April to November 2020. Five large 
CTCs in district referral hospitals were selected representing the five 
districts of Dar es Salaam including Mwananyamala, Temeke, and Amana regional 
referral hospitals and Sinza and Vijibweni hospitals. The study population 
consisted of adult PLHA aged 18 years and above. The primary outcome measure was 
the prevalence of NCDs among HIV patients. Observation of actual NCD medications 
or their purchase receipts or booked NCD clinic appointments that PLHA had 
during the study period was used to verify the reported presence of NCDs. The 
secondary outcome measure was the prevalence of probable depression among PLHA. 
The locally validated Swahili Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to 
screen for depressive symptom severity. A logistic regression model was used to 
identify factors associated with common NCDs and those associated with probable 
depression. Potential risk factors that were statistically significant at a 
P-value of 0.2 or less in univariable analysis were included as potential 
confounders in multivariable models.
RESULTS: The median age of participants was 42 (IQR 35-49) years, with 32.7% in 
the 36-45 years age group. The majority of patients were women (69%). Most 
(80.5%) had achieved HIV viral (VL) suppression (a serum HIV VL of <1000 
copies/ml). Overall, 14.3% of self-reported an NCD with evidence of their 
current medication for the NCD from receipts for medication purchased and 
appointments from NCD clinics they attended. In the multivariable analyses, 
higher odds of NCDs were in older patients (>45 years) and those with a weight 
above 75 kg (P < 0.05). Male patients had 51% reduced odds of NCDs (aOR 0.49; 
95% CI: 0.32-0.74) than females (P < 0.001). Probable depression prevalence was 
11.8%, and depressed patients had more than twice the odds of having NCDs than 
those without depression (aOR 2.26; 95% CI: 1.45-3.51; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study determined co-existing previously diagnosed NCDs among 
PLHA accessing care and high levels of depressive symptom severity. We recommend 
additional research on the feasibility, acceptability, and cost implications of 
screening and treating NCDs on HIV care platforms to provide evidence for 
Tanzania's integrated HIV/NCD care model.

INTRODUCTION: With the worldwide increase of life expectancy leading to a higher 
proportion of older adults experiencing age-associated deterioration of 
cognitive abilities, the development of effective and widely accessible 
prevention and therapeutic measures has become a priority and challenge for 
modern medicine. Combined interventions of cognitive training and transcranial 
direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown promising results for counteracting 
age-associated cognitive decline. However, access to clinical centres for 
repeated sessions is challenging, particularly in rural areas and for older 
adults with reduced mobility, and lack of clinical personnel and hospital space 
prevents extended interventions in larger cohorts. A home-based and remotely 
supervised application of tDCS would make the treatment more accessible for 
participants and relieve clinical resources. So far, studies assessing 
feasibility of combined interventions with a focus on cognition in a home-based 
setting are rare. With this study, we aim to provide evidence for the 
feasibility and the effects of a multisession home-based cognitive training in 
combination with tDCS on cognitive functions of healthy older adults.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The TrainStim-Home trial is a monocentric, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Thirty healthy participants, aged 60-80 
years, will receive 2 weeks of combined cognitive training and anodal tDCS over 
left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (target intervention), compared with 
cognitive training plus sham stimulation. The cognitive training will comprise a 
letter updating task, and the participants will be stimulated for 20 min with 
1.5 mA. The intervention sessions will take place at the participants' home, and 
primary outcome will be the feasibility, operationalised by two-thirds 
successfully completed sessions per participant. Additionally, performance in 
the training task and an untrained task will be analysed.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by the ethics committee 
of the University Medicine Greifswald. Results will be available through 
publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national and 
international conferences.

INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary venous (PV) electrical recovery underlies most 
arrhythmia recurrences after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Little is known 
about procedural profiles and outcomes of patients with electrically silent PVs 
upon redo ablation for AF.
METHODS: In a prospectively maintained registry, we enrolled 838 consecutive 
patients (2013-2016) undergoing redo ablation procedures. Ablation procedures 
targeted the PVs, the PV antra, and non-PV sites at operators' discretion. 
Procedural profiles and clinical outcomes were assessed. The primary outcome was 
freedom from AF after a 3-month blanking period. The secondary outcome was 
improvement in quality of life.
RESULTS: Most patients undergoing redo AF ablation (n = 684, 82%) had PV 
reconnection while the remaining 154 (18%) had electrically silent PVs. Patients 
with recurrent AF and electrically silent PVs were older (66 vs. 64 years, 
p = .02), had more prior ablation procedures (median 2 IQR 1-3 vs 1 IQR 1-2 
p = .001), were more likely to have non-paroxysmal AF (62% vs. 49%, p = .004) 
and atrial flutter (48% vs. 29%, p = .001) and had significantly larger left 
atrial volumes (89 vs. 81 ml, p = .003). Patients with silent PVs underwent a 
more extensive non-PV ablation strategies with antral extension of prior 
ablation sets in addition to ablation of the roof, appendage, inferior to the 
right PVs, peri-mitral flutter lines, cavotricuspid isthmus lines and ablation 
in the coronary sinus. Upon one year of follow-up, patients with electrically 
silent PVs were less likely to remain free from recurrent atrial arrhythmias 
(64% vs. 76%, p = .008). Regardless of PV reconnection status, redo ablation 
resulted in improvement in quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Rhythm control with extensive ablation allowed maintenance of sinus 
rhythm in about two thirds of patients with silent PVs during redo AF ablation 
procedures. Regardless of PV reconnection status, redo ablation resulted in 
improvement in quality of life. This remains a challenging group of patients, 
highlighting the need to better understand non-PV mediated AF.

Health expectancies are an indicator of healthy ageing that reflect quantity and 
quality of life. Using limiting long term illness and mortality prevalence, we 
calculate disability-free life expectancy for small areas in England and Wales 
between 1991 and 2011 for males and females aged 50-74, the life stage when 
people may be changing their occupation from main career to retirement or 
alternative work activities. We find that inequalities in disability-free life 
expectancy are deeply entrenched, including former coalfield and ex-industrial 
areas and that areas of persistent (dis-) advantage, worsening or improving 
deprivation have health change in line with deprivation change. A mixed health 
picture for rural and coastal areas requires further investigation as do the 
demographic processes which underpin these area level health differences.

BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) including hypertension, coronary 
heart disease, diabetes and stroke, are always combined with each other, leading 
to cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM). Mood disorder was associated with onset 
of CMD. However, the impact of mood disorder on the transition from single CMD 
to CMM was poorly understood.
METHODS: A total of 95,351 participants with single CMD, with median age of 59 
(range 40 to 71) years from UK Biobank were enrolled at baseline. Competing risk 
regression models were used to estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence 
intervals (CIs) of association between mood disorder categories and progress 
from single CMD to CMM. Association of mood disorder with mortality, and life 
expectancy differences were also calculated by flexible parametric 
proportion-hazard models.
RESULTS: Relative associations were observed between mood disorder and the 
progress from first onset of CMD to CMM. Adjusted HRs for progress to CMM from 
those with comorbid CMD plus depression or bipolar were increased (depression: 
1.23 [1.19 1.27]; bipolar: 1.47 [1.31 1.66]), compared with those with the sole 
CMD. Mood disorder also had impact on all-cause mortality (depression: 1.17 
[1.10 1.24]; bipolar: 2.03 [1.74 2.32]) and reduced life expectancy estimates 
for those with single CMD.
LIMITATIONS: This cohort primarily comprises White individuals. Covariates only 
measured at baseline and assumed unchanged during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Mood disorder conferred greater hazard on the CMM and mortality 
outcome. This study highlighted the importance of depression and bipolar in 
disease progression, from single CMD, to multimorbidity or mortality.

Deposition of misfolded protein aggregates in key areas of human brain is the 
quintessential trait of various pertinent neurodegenerative disorders including 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Genetic point mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide 
dismutase (SOD1) are found to be the most important contributing factor behind 
familial ALS. Especially, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A4V is the most 
nocuous since it substantially decreases life expectancy of patients. Besides, 
the use of naturally occurring polyphenolic flavonoids is profoundly being 
advocated for palliating amyloidogenic behavior of proteopathic proteins. In the 
present analysis, through proficient computational tools, we have attempted to 
ascertain a pharmacodynamically promising flavonoid compound that effectively 
curbs the pathogenic behavior of A4V SOD1 mutant. Initial screening of 
flavonoids that exhibit potency against amyloids identified morin, myricetin and 
epigallocatechin gallate as promising leads. Further, with the help of feasible 
and yet adept protein-ligand interaction studies and stalwart molecular 
simulation analyses, we were able to observe that aforementioned flavonoids were 
able to considerably divert mutant A4V SOD1 from its distinct pathogenic 
behavior. Among which, morin showed the most curative potential against A4V 
SOD1. Therefore, morin holds a great therapeutic potential in contriving highly 
efficacious inhibitors in mitigating fatal and insuperable ALS.

Down syndrome (DS) is a common congenital disorder caused by trisomy 21. Due to 
the increase in maternal age with population aging and advances in medical 
treatment for fatal complications in their early childhood, the prevalence and 
life expectancy of DS individuals have greatly increased. Despite this rise in 
the number of DS adults, their hematological status remains poorly examined. 
Here, we report that three hematological abnormalities, leukopenia, 
macrocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, develop as adult DS-associated features. 
Multi- and uni-variate analyses on hematological data collected from 51 DS and 
60 control adults demonstrated that young adults with DS are at significantly 
higher risk of (i) myeloid-dominant leukopenia, (ii) macrocytosis characterized 
by high mean cell volume (MCV) of erythrocytes, and (iii) lower platelet counts 
than the control. Notably, these features were more pronounced with age. Further 
analyses on DS adults would provide a deeper understanding and novel research 
perspectives for multiple aging-related disorders in the general population.

Adults with intellectual disabilities have increasing life expectancy but may be 
susceptible to early aging-related conditions. The purpose of this study was to 
examine associations between the presence of low muscle strength, low bone 
mineral density, and high body mass index with age and sex in adult Special 
Olympics athletes. Grip strength (n = 6,477; 40.9% female), chair stand time (n 
= 6,444; 40.5% female), body mass index (n = 7,824; 43.7% female), and bone 
mineral density (n = 3,091; 43.2% female) measurements were provided by Special 
Olympics International. Poor grip strength, chair stand time, bone mineral 
density, and body mass index were identified in 43.8%, 46.2%, 28.7%, and 50.3% 
of each sample, respectively. Increasing age was a risk factor for all 
conditions (odds ratio = 1.30-10.89; p < .05). High rates of adverse health 
conditions were observed in a sample of adults with intellectual disabilities. 
Increased risk was observed as early as the fourth decade of life.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implant (TAVI) is gaining momentum in the 
treatment of severe, symptomatic aortic valve stenosis, and its indication is 
expanding to lower surgical risk individuals, who are generally younger and have 
a long life expectancy. Therefore, transcatheter bioprostheses durability 
appears of critical importance. Aim of the present study is to evaluate mid-term 
outcomes of TAVI in a high-volume single center cohort.
METHODS: We analyzed all consecutive patients (n = 408) who underwent 
transfemoral TAVI at a single, high-volume center, between 2007 and 2014. Study 
objectives were all-cause death and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) at long 
term follow-up. Structural valve deterioration (SVD), BVF and valve-related 
death were defined according to current international standards. Follow-up was 
performed by in person visit and transthoracic echocardiography, which was 
obtained only in a minority of patients, or phone call as per patient 
preference.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 1821 days, overall mortality was 64.5%, with 
cardiovascular disease accounting for roughly half of total deaths. 
Valve-related deaths occurred in 10 patients. Seventeen patients were diagnosed 
with BVF, and 15 required repeat intervention. Moderate and severe SVD were 
observed in 10 and 7 patients, respectively. In the subgroup of patients with 
echocardiographic mid-term follow-up (n = 76), no significant increase of 
transprosthetic gradients nor increase of significant regurgitation was 
detected.
CONCLUSION: In the present unselected, all-comers cohort, TAVI bioprostheses 
appeared to have excellent durability at long-term follow-up.

In the daily practice of medicine, health care providers oftentimes confront the 
dilemma of offering 'maximum care' based on available technologies and advances 
versus ethical concerns about futility. Regardless of cultural backgrounds and 
differences, most human beings aspire to an illness-free life, or better yet, a 
life lived with utmost quality and longevity. On account on ongoing advances in 
science and technology, the possibility of achieving "immortality" (a term used 
as a metaphor for an extremely long and disease-free life) is increasingly 
perceived as a realistic goal, which is aggressively pursued by some of the 
world's wealthiest individuals and corporations. However, this quest is not 
taking place in a philosophical or religious vacuum, which is why we attempt to 
evaluate the current state of knowledge on religious beliefs revolving around 
immortality and their alignments with today's medical advancements. The 
literature searches were performed using relevant databases including JSTOR and 
PubMed, as well as primary religious sources. Most religions present longevity 
as a blessing and believe in some sort of immortality, afterlife or 
reincarnation for the immortal soul. The quest for immortality beyond life in a 
"body of death" remains consistent with access to medical care and the 
legitimate possibility of achieving longevity-as long as certain ethical and 
religious parameters are preserved.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a critical public health issue 
worldwide, and its epidemiological patterns have changed over the decades. This 
article aimed to estimate the global trends of RHD, and attributable risks from 
1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data on RHD burden were explored from the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019. Trends of the RHD burden were estimated using the estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) and age-standardized rate (ASR).
RESULTS: During 1990-2019, increasing trends in the ASR of incidence and 
prevalence of RHD were observed worldwide, with the respective EAPCs of 0.58 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52 to 0.63) and 0.57 (95%CI 0.50 to 0.63). 
Meanwhile, increasing trends commonly occurred in low and middle 
Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) regions and countries. The largest increasing 
trends in the ASR of incidence and prevalence were seen in Fiji, with the 
respective EAPCs being 2.17 (95%CI 1.48 to 2.86) and 2.22 (95%CI 1.53 to 2.91). 
However, death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to RHD showed 
pronounced decreasing trends of ASR globally, in which the EAPCs were - 2.98 
(95%CI - 3.03 to - 2.94) and - 2.70 (95%CI - 2.75 to - 2.65), respectively. 
Meanwhile, decreasing trends were also observed in all SDI areas and geographic 
regions. The largest decreasing trends of death were observed in Thailand (EAPC 
= - 9.55, 95%CI - 10.48 to - 8.61). Among the attributable risks, behavioral 
risk-related death and DALYs caused by RHD had pronounced decreasing trends 
worldwide and in SDI areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Pronounced decreasing trends of death and DALYs caused by RHD were 
observed in regions and countries from 1990 to 2019, but the RHD burden remains 
a substantial challenge globally. The results would inform the strategies for 
more effective prevention and control of RHD.
