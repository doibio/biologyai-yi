BACKGROUND: Maintenance gefitinib significantly prolonged progression-free 
survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients from eastern Asian with locally 
advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after four 
chemotherapeutic cycles (21 days per cycle) of first-line platinum-based 
combination chemotherapy without disease progression. The objective of the 
current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of maintenance gefitinib 
therapy after four chemotherapeutic cycle's stand first-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with unknown 
EGFR mutations, from a Chinese health care system perspective.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A semi-Markov model was designed to evaluate 
cost-effectiveness of the maintenance gefitinib treatment. Two-parametric 
Weibull and Log-logistic distribution were fitted to PFS and overall survival 
curves independently. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to assess the stability of the model designed. The model base-case 
analysis suggested that maintenance gefitinib would increase benefits in a 1, 3, 
6 or 10-year time horizon, with incremental $184,829, $19,214, $19,328, and 
$21,308 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively. The most 
sensitive influential variable in the cost-effectiveness analysis was utility of 
PFS plus rash, followed by utility of PFS plus diarrhoea, utility of progressed 
disease, price of gefitinib, cost of follow-up treatment in progressed survival 
state, and utility of PFS on oral therapy. The price of gefitinib is the most 
significant parameter that could reduce the incremental cost per QALY. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the cost-effective probability 
of maintenance gefitinib was zero under the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold 
of $16,349 (3 × per-capita gross domestic product of China). The sensitivity 
analyses all suggested that the model was robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance gefitinib following first-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC with unknown 
EGFR mutations is not cost-effective. Decreasing the price of gefitinib may be a 
preferential choice for meeting widely treatment demands in China.

BACKGROUND: The Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D), a new generic preference-based 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instrument, has been validated for use in 
young people in both the UK and Australia. The main objectives of this study 
were to examine the feasibility of using a Chinese version of the CHU9D 
(CHU9D-CHN) to assess HRQoL and to investigate the association of physical 
activity, homework hours and sleep duration with HRQoL in children and 
adolescents in Mainland China.
METHODS: Data were collected using a multi-stage sampling method from grades 
4-12 students in May 2013 in Nanjing, China. Consenting participants (N = 815) 
completed a self-administered questionnaire including the CHU9D-CHN instrument 
and information on physical activity, homework and sleep duration, self-reported 
health status, and socio-demographic characteristics. Descriptive and 
multivariate linear regression analyses were undertaken. CHU9D-CHN utility 
scores were generated by employing two scoring algorithms currently available 
for the instrument, the first derived from UK adults utilising the standard 
gamble (SG) valuation method and the second derived from Australian adolescents 
utilising the best-worst scaling (BWS) method.
RESULTS: It was found that CHU9D utility scores discriminated well in relation 
to self-reported health status and that better health status was significantly 
associated with higher utility scores regardless of which scoring algorithm was 
employed (both p<0.001). The adjusted mean utilities were significantly higher 
for physically active than inactive students (0.023 by SG, 0.029 by BWS scoring 
methods, p<0.05). An additional hour of doing homework and sleep duration were, 
separately, associated with mean utilities of -0.019 and 0.032 based on SG, and 
-0.021 and 0.040 according to BWS scoring algorithms (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: The CHU9D-CHN shows promise for measuring and valuing the HRQoL of 
children and adolescents in China. Levels of self-reported physical activity, 
homework and sleep time were important influencers of utility scores.

Laparoscopic approach to gastrointestinal malignancies: toward the future with 
caution.

After the rapid acceptance of laparoscopy to manage multiple benign diseases 
arising from gastrointestinal districts, some surgeons started to treat 
malignancies by the same way. However, if the limits of laparoscopy for benign 
diseases are mainly represented by technical issues, oncologic outcomes remain 
the foundation of any procedures to cure malignancies. Cancerous patients 
represent an important group with peculiar aspects including reduced survival 
expectancy, worsened quality of life due to surgery itself and adjuvant 
therapies, and challenging psychological impact. All these issues could, 
potentially, receive a better management with a laparoscopic surgical approach. 
In order to confirm such aspects, similarly to testing the newest weapons 
(surgical or pharmacologic) against cancer, long-term follow-up is always 
recommendable to assess the real benefits in terms of overall survival, 
cancer-free survival and quality of life. Furthermore, it seems of crucial 
importance that surgeons will be correctly trained in specific oncologic 
principles of surgical oncology as well as in modern miniinvasive technologies. 
Therefore, laparoscopic treatment of gastrointestinal malignancies requires more 
caution and deep analysis of published evidences, as compared to those achieved 
for inflammatory bowel diseases, gastroesophageal reflux disease or diverticular 
disease. This review tries to examine the evidence available to date for the use 
of laparoscopy and robotics in malignancies arising from the gastrointestinal 
district.

The pharmaceutical industry has significantly contributed to improving human 
health. Drugs have been attributed to both increasing life expectancy and 
decreasing health care costs. Unfortunately, there has been a recent decline in 
the creativity and productivity of the pharmaceutical industry. This is a 
complex issue with many contributing factors resulting from the numerous 
mergers, increase in out-sourcing, and the heavy dependency on high-throughput 
screening (HTS). While a simple solution to such a complex problem is 
unrealistic and highly unlikely, the inclusion of metabolomics as a routine 
component of the drug discovery process may provide some solutions to these 
problems. Specifically, as the binding affinity of a chemical lead is evolved 
during the iterative structure-based drug design process, metabolomics can 
provide feedback on the selectivity and the in vivo mechanism of action. 
Similarly, metabolomics can be used to evaluate and validate HTS leads. In 
effect, metabolomics can be used to eliminate compounds with potential efficacy 
and side effect problems while prioritizing well-behaved leads with druglike 
characteristics.

Increase of oxidation and inflammation in nervous and immune systems with aging 
and anxiety.

According to the oxidation-inflammation theory of aging, chronic oxidative 
stress and inflammatory stress situations (with higher levels of oxidant and 
inflammatory compounds and lower antioxidant and anti-inflammatory defenses) are 
the basis of the agerelated impairment of organism functions, including those of 
the nervous and immune systems, as well as of the neuroimmune communication, 
which explains the altered homeostasis and the resulting increase of morbidity 
and mortality. Overproduction of oxidant compounds can induce an inflammatory 
response, since oxidants are inflammation effectors. Thus, oxidation and 
inflammation are interlinked processes and have many feedback loops. However, 
the nature of their potential interactions, mainly in the brain and immune 
cells, and their key involvement in aging remain unclear. Moreover, in the 
context of the neuroimmune communication, it has been described that an 
oxidative-inflammatory situation occurs in subjects with anxiety, and this 
situation contributes to an immunosenescence, alteration of survival responses 
and shorter life span. As an example of this, a model of premature aging in 
mice, in which animals show a poor response to stress and high levels of 
anxiety, an oxidative stress in their immune cells and tissues, as well as a 
premature immunosenescence and a shorter life expectancy, will be commented in 
the present review. This model supports the hypothesis that anxiety can be a 
situation of chronic oxidative stress and inflammation, especially in brain and 
immune cells, and this accelerates the rate of aging.

Measures of disease burden such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are 
increasingly important to risk-based food safety policy. They provide a means of 
comparing relative risk from diverse health outcomes. We present detailed 
disease-outcome trees and EQ-5D scoring for 14 major foodborne pathogens 
representing over 95% of foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths due 
to specified agents in the United States (Campylobacter spp., Clostridium 
perfringens, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Escherichia coli 
O157:H7, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli non-O157, Listeria monocytogenes, 
nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica, Shigella, Toxoplasma gondii, Vibrio 
vulnificus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and other noncholera Vibrio, and Yersinia 
enterocolitica). We estimate over 5800 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of L. 
monocytogenes and V. vulnificus, compared to 125 QALYs lost per 1000 cases of T. 
gondii, 26 for E. coli O157:H7, 16 for Salmonella and Campylobacter, and 14 for 
Y. enterocolitica. The remaining 7 pathogens are estimated to cause less than 5 
QALYs lost per 1000 cases. In total, these 14 pathogens cause over 61,000 in 
QALY loss annually, with more than 90% due solely to acute infection being 
responsible for 65% of total QALY loss, with premature mortality and morbidity 
due to chronic and congenital illness responsible for another 28%. These 
estimates of the burden of chronic sequelae are likely conservative; additional 
epidemiological research is needed to support more accurate burden estimates. 
This study shows the value of using integrated metrics for comparing disease 
burden, and the need to consider chronic and congenital illness when 
prioritizing foodborne pathogens.

Balancing cardiovascular (CV) and cancer death among patients with small renal 
masses: modification by CV risk.

Surgical Trials and Outcomes Research, Department of Surgery, Johns Hopkins 
Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA; Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Johns 
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To assess modification of comparative cancer survival by 
cardiovascular (CV) risk and treatment strategy among older patients with small 
renal masses (SRMs).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with localised T1a renal cell carcinoma were 
identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database 
(1995-2007). Patients were stratified by CV risk, using major atherosclerotic CV 
comorbidities identified by the Framingham Heart Study, to compare overall (OS), 
cancer-specific (CSS), and CV-specific survival (CVSS) for those who deferred 
therapy (DT) to those undergoing either partial (PN) or radical nephrectomy 
(RN). Cox proportional hazards and Fine and Gray competing risks regression 
adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and tumour size were performed.
RESULTS: In all, 754 (10.5%) patients had DT, 1849 (25.8%) patients underwent 
PN, and 4574 (63.7%) patients underwent RN. Patients at high CV risk who had DT 
had the greatest CV-to-cancer mortality rate ratio (2.89), and CV risk was 
generally associated with worse OS and CVSS. Patients in the high CV risk strata 
had no difference in CSS between treatment strategies [DT vs PN: hazard ratio 
(HR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.41; DT vs RN: HR 0.81, 95%CI 
0.46-1.43)], while there was a 2-4 fold CSS benefit for surgery in the low CV 
risk strata.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survival was comparable across treatment strategies for 
older patients with SRMs with high risk CV disease. Greater attention to CV 
comorbidity as it relates to competing risks of death and life expectancy may be 
deserved in selecting patients appropriate for active surveillance because 
patients at low CV risk might benefit from surgery.

Fractures in patients aged ≥ 65 years constitute an increasing burden on health 
and social care and are associated with a high morbidity and mortality. There is 
little accurate information about the epidemiology of fractures in the elderly. 
We have analysed prospectively collected data on 4786 in- and out-patients who 
presented with a fracture over two one-year periods. Analysis shows that there 
are six patterns of the incidence of fractures in patients aged ≥ 65 years. In 
males six types of fracture increase in incidence after the age of 65 years and 
11 types increase in females aged over 65 years. Five types of fracture decrease 
in incidence after the age of 65 years. Multiple fractures increase in incidence 
in both males and females aged ≥ 65 years, as do fractures related to falls. 
Analysis of the incidence of fractures, together with life expectancy, shows 
that the probability of males and females aged ≥ 65 years having a fracture 
during the rest of their life is 18.5% and 52.0%, respectively. The equivalent 
figures for males and females aged ≥ 80 years are 13.3% and 34.8%, respectively.

Hypothalamic-mediated control of glucose balance in the presence and absence of 
insulin.

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.

Diabetes afflicts hundreds of millions worldwide. People affected by type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM; the insulin-deficient form of diabetes) or type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM; the insulin-resistant form of diabetes) have 
significantly reduced life expectancy compared to normal individuals. This is 
due in part to the fact that (despite improvements) current anti-diabetic 
approaches are suboptimal. Indeed, severe morbidities (e.g.: cardiovascular 
disease, hypertension) are still too often associated with diabetes. Recent 
preclinical results indicate that different types of hypothalamic neurons are 
endowed with the ability to mediate the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the 
adipocyte-derived hormone leptin in an insulin-dependent and insulin-independent 
fashion. These results may pave the way for better anti-diabetic approaches and 
therefore positively impact on life expectancy of diabetic subjects.

Early HIV treatment in the United States prevented nearly 13,500 infections per 
year during 1996-2009.

Goldman DP, Juday T, Seekins D, Linthicum MT, Romley JA.

In recent years, guidelines for HIV treatment have recommended initiation of 
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) earlier in the course of the disease 
than was previously the case. These recommendations stem in part from growing 
evidence that treatment reduces the risk of sexual transmission. We used an 
epidemiological model of disease transmission and progression to assess HIV 
prevention through early treatment-that is, initiation of cART when CD4 white 
blood cell counts are in excess of 350 cells per cubic millimeter. (CD4 cells 
are involved in the immune system's defense against tumors and infection; the 
number of CD4 cells in a cubic millimeter of blood is a standard measure of 
immune response to antiretroviral therapy.) We estimated that the actual timing 
of treatment initiation in the United States prevented 188,000 HIV cases in the 
period 1996-2009. "Very early" treatment (at CD4 counts greater than 500) 
accounted for four-fifths of the prevented cases. For all of the prevented 
cases, the losses in life expectancy that were avoided were worth $128 billion, 
assuming that a life-year has a value of $150,000. These findings underscore the 
cost-effectiveness of early HIV treatment.

Early HIV treatment led to life expectancy gains valued at $80 billion for 
people infected in 1996-2009.

Romley JA, Juday T, Solomon MD, Seekins D, Brookmeyer R, Goldman DP.

In late 2009 US guidelines for HIV treatment were revised to recommend the 
initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) earlier in the course of 
the disease. We analyzed the life expectancy gains of people infected with HIV 
between the introduction of cART in 1996 and the 2009 guideline revisions. 
Compared to people who initiated cART late (defined as having a CD4 cell count 
of less than 350 per cubic millimeter of blood), those who initiated treatment 
early (with a CD4 count of 350-500) could expect to live 6.1 years longer, and 
the earliest initiators (with a CD4 count of more than 500) could expect an 
extra 9.0 years of life. The total value of life expectancy gains to the early 
and earliest initiators of treatment was $80 billion, with each life-year valued 
at $150,000. The value of the survival gains was more than double the increase 
in drug manufacturers' revenues from early cART initiation. Our results clarify 
the economic implications of adherence to treatment guidelines.

Dacryocystocele (mucocele, amniocele) is a relatively rare variant of 
nasolacrimal duct obstruction which refers to the cystic dilatation of lacrimal 
pathway above and below the lacrimal sac. It is a benign pathology and can be 
treated successfully after birth, but its prenatal detection is important, 
because it may be seen in numerous syndromes and may serve as their marker. 
Bilateral cysts have the possibility for intranasal extension and an obstruction 
to the nasal passages may result in neonatal respiratory distress requiring 
surgical intervention Unilateral cases are important for the differential 
diagnosis with serious facial abnormalities. We present a case of early prenatal 
detection of a 28 year-old G: 1 P: 0 pregnant woman with bilateral 
dacryocystocele. She presented a live, normally developed singleton fetus on 
sonographic examination at 12, 16 and 22 weeks. At 25(th) weeks, we diagnosed a 
hypoechogenic mass, that was situated inferomedially to the eyes in the fetal 
face with 2 and 3-D ultrasound. A 3850-g live female infant was delivered by 
Cesarean section due to breech presentation at 39 weeks following preterm 
rupture of membranes. We report the case with intranasal components studied 
during fetal life by 2 and 3-D ultrasound and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the histopathological basis of individually tailored 
less radical surgery concept in patients with International Federation of 
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB cervical cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed in the gynaecologic oncology 
department of Başkent School of Medicine Hospital, Ankara, Turkey between 
January 1(st) 2008 and January 1(st) 2009. Cardinal and uterosacral ligaments 
were serially sectioned in an alternative approach, and were examined by a 
senior gynaecologic pathologist. Clinical and pathological features and findings 
in sections of uterine ligaments were recorded. Study data were analysed using 
the SPSS 17.0 program.
RESULTS: Thirty-two out of 38 cases had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (84.2 %), 
and six had non-squamous cell tumours (15.8%). Four cases had microscopic (10.5 
%) and one case had macroscopic (2.6 %) tumour extension in cardinal ligaments. 
Mean tumour-free cardinal ligament length was 16.8±7.39 mm. Presence of tumour 
invasion in cardinal ligaments correlated significantly with pelvic lymph node 
metastasis (p=0.02). No isolated tumour deposits were found in any of the cases 
in serial sections of the cardinal or uterosacral ligaments.
CONCLUSION: This research was designed as a preliminary study. Future studies 
are needed to determine the optimal resection margins of the uterine ligaments 
in surgically treated stage IB cervical cancer. With continuing research and the 
development of newer surgical techniques, patients' quality of life will be 
optimised accordingly.

Soil liquefaction has been observed worldwide during recent major earthquakes 
with induced effects responsible for much of the damage, disruption of function, 
and considerable replacement expenses for structures. The phenomenon has not 
been documented in recent time with such damage in Italian context before the 
recent Emilia-Romagna Earthquake (May 2012). The main lateral spreading and 
vertical deformations affected the stability of many buildings and impacted 
social life inducing valuable lessons on liquefaction risk assessment and 
remediation. This paper aims first of all to reproduce soil response to 
liquefaction-induced lateral effects and thus to evaluate stone column 
mitigation technique effectiveness by gradually increasing the extension of 
remediation, in order to achieve a satisfactory lower level of permanent 
deformations. The study is based on the use of a FE computational interface able 
to analyse the earthquake-induced three-dimensional pore pressure generation 
adopting one of the most credited nonlinear theories in order to assess 
realistically the displacements connected to lateral spreading.

The appropriate use of neuroimaging in the diagnostic work-up of dementia: an 
economic literature review and cost-effectiveness analysis.

Bermingham SL.

BACKGROUND: Structural brain imaging is often performed to establish the 
underlying causes of dementia. However, recommendations differ as to who should 
receive neuroimaging and whether computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) should be used.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness in Ontario of 
offering structural imaging to all patients with mild to moderate dementia 
compared with offering it selectively according to guidelines from the Canadian 
Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia (CCC). We 
compared the cost-effectiveness of CT and MRI as first-line strategies.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search (2000 to 2013) to identify 
cost-effectiveness studies of clinical prediction rules and structural imaging 
modalities. Studies were assessed for quality and applicability to Ontario. We 
also developed a model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of clinical guidelines 
(image all versus according to CCC) and modalities (CT versus MRI). Transition 
probabilities, utilities, and costs were obtained from published literature or 
expert opinion. Results were expressed in terms of costs and quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: No relevant cost-effectiveness analyses were identified in the 
published literature. According to the base-case results of our model, the most 
effective and cost-effective strategy is to image patients who meet CCC criteria 
with CT and to follow-up with MRI for suspected cases of space-occupying lesions 
(SOL). However, the results were sensitive to the specificity of MRI for 
detecting vascular causes of dementia. At a specificity of 64%, the most 
cost-effective strategy is CCC followed by MRI.
LIMITATIONS: Studies used to estimate diagnostic accuracy were limited by a lack 
of a gold standard test for establishing the cause of dementia. The model does 
not include costs to patients and their families, nor does it account for 
patient preferences about diagnostic information.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the relative prevalence of vascular dementia and SOLs, and 
the improvement in QALYs associated with treatment, the strategy with the 
greatest combined sensitivity (CCC with CT followed by MRI for patients with 
SOLs) results in the greatest number of QALYs and is the least costly. Due to 
limitations in the clinical data and challenges in the interpretation of this 
evidence, the model should be considered a framework for assessing uncertainty 
in the evidence base rather than providing definitive answers to the research 
questions.

Hypertension is recognized as one of the risk factors for cardiovascular 
mortality and morbidity. Early identification of persons at increased risk for 
developing hypertension is a priority, which help them, to live a healthy life 
by altering lifestyle. Persons having predisposing factors of hypertension 
(e.g., family history of hypertension) show blood pressure hyper-responsiveness 
to stress. Elevated blood pressure due to sympathetic stimulation prevailed 
longer time in susceptible persons. In previous studies some instruments (e.g., 
hand immersion in cold (4 degrees C) water or isometric exercise by handgrip 
dynamometer) were required to elicit sympathetic stimulation. In the present 
study a simple maneuver Full Knee Extension Horizontally (FKEH) has been 
introduced--a stressor that caused full isometric contraction of quadriceps 
femoris muscles of both sides. The test was conducted in normotensive, 
non-smoker males (n = 150) of age group 18-25 years. Among them some (n = 100) 
were from families having no history of familial hypertension and others (n = 
50) were from the families with history of hypertension. The causal blood 
pressure and heart rate of the participants were recorded. Then the volunteers 
were requested to perform FKEH maneuver for one minute. Both blood pressure and 
heart rate were recorded immediately after and 3 minutes following FKEH. The 
data analyzed using t-test showed that, diastolic blood pressure didn't return 
and stabilized to pre-exercise level even after 3 minutes following FKEH in 
volunteers who were mostly from hypertensive family (P< 0.05) i.e., having 
predisposing factors of hypertension. This indicated those people are prone to 
early onset of hypertension as their Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is not 
competent enough to stabilize their blood pressure to pre-exercise level. Hence, 
stress in the form of FKEH for one minute may be used as a bedside test to 
assess the competence of ANS and the proneness of developing early hypertension.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol 
(CZP) plus methotrexate treatment and to assess the efficacy of two CZP 
maintenance dosing schedules in Japanese rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with 
an inadequate response to methotrexate.
METHODS: J-RAPID double-blind patients were entered into an open-label extension 
(OLE) study. Patients withdrawn due to lack of efficacy at 16 weeks and 
double-blind completers without a week-24 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
20 response received CZP 200 mg every other week (Q2W) plus methotrexate. 
Double-blind completers with week-24 ACR20 responses were randomized to CZP 200 
mg Q2W plus methotrexate or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks plus methotrexate.
RESULTS: The ACR20/ACR50/ACR70 response rates of double-blind completers (n = 
204) were 89.7%/67.2%/36.3% at OLE entry and 95.6%/84.8%/58.3% at 52 weeks, 
respectively. Other clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes were 
sustained with long-term CZP plus methotrexate. Long-term treatment with CZP was 
well-tolerated with no new unexpected adverse events observed. The efficacy and 
safety of CZP treatment were similar between the two dosing schedules.
CONCLUSIONS: Continued CZP administration with methotrexate maintained efficacy 
over 52 weeks and was well-tolerated for Japanese RA patients. No obvious 
differences in clinical efficacy and safety were observed between the two dosing 
schedules, giving flexibility in maintenance administration schedules.

The SAR matrix data structure organizes compound data sets according to 
structurally analogous matching molecular series in a format reminiscent of 
conventional R-group tables. An intrinsic feature of SAR matrices is that they 
contain many virtual compounds that represent unexplored combinations of core 
structures and substituents extracted from compound data sets on the basis of 
the matched molecular pair formalism. These virtual compounds are candidates for 
further exploration but are difficult, if not impossible to prioritize on the 
basis of visual inspection of multiple SAR matrices. Therefore, we introduce 
herein a compound neighborhood concept as an extension of the SAR matrix data 
structure that makes it possible to identify preferred virtual compounds for 
further analysis. On the basis of well-defined compound neighborhoods, the 
potency of virtual compounds can be predicted by considering individual 
contributions of core structures and substituents from neighbors. In extensive 
benchmark studies, virtual compounds have been prioritized in different data 
sets on the basis of multiple neighborhoods yielding accurate potency 
predictions.

Accidents involving portable ladders are a common cause of serious occupational 
and non-occupational injuries throughout the industrialized world. Many of these 
injuries could be prevented with better instruction on the proper usage of 
portable ladders. Research is reported that focused on both the human factors 
and engineering aspects of portable extension ladder usage based on common 
ladder setup procedures. Results of the human factors experiment revealed 
evidence of unsafe acts that could lead to catastrophic ladder slide-out 
accidents in real-life situations. Six different ladder setup methods were 
evaluated for safety and stability based on placement angles: the basic, 75 
degree, stand-reach, L sticker, 4:1, and bubble level methods. Ideally, ladder 
users would set the ladder up at 75.5 degrees to achieve the consensus industry 
standard safest angle. Setup methods varied in complexity and nature of 
instruction. The level method produced the most accurate and the least variable 
results. The engineering analysis determined the coefficient of friction of a 
variety of clean and contaminated surfaces commonly used with ladders. This 
analysis determined the total number of slide-out failures that would likely 
have occurred in the data obtained in each of the ladder setup methods tested in 
the human factors experiment. Based on test participants' setup angles, the 
average calculated ladder slide-out failure rate was 8.7 percent for ladders 
positioned on a surface with the lowest measured coefficient of friction. When 
broken down by ladder setup method, the 4:1 method had a failure rate of 18.8 
percent, the 75 degree method had a failure rate of 15.2 percent, and the basic 
method had a failure rate of 9.8 percent. The stand-reach and L sticker methods 
had identical failure rates at 3.3 percent and the level method was best at 1.1 
percent. The level method provided the lowest error, least variability, and 
setup closest to the target angle of 75.5 degrees. Analysis of the overall 
results revealed the need for additional user training and clearer instructions 
affixed to ladders. This research is unique in that it combines an analysis and 
comparison of human factors and engineering in the same study.

OBJECTIVES: Patients undergoing major surgery are at high risk of increased 
postoperative morbidity and mortality. Goal-directed therapy has been shown to 
improve outcomes when commenced in the early postoperative period, yet the 
economic impact remains unclear. The aim of our study was to assess the cost 
effectiveness of goal-directed therapy as part of postoperative management.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis to determine short and long term clinical 
and financial benefits. A decision tree was constructed to determine short-term 
"in-hospital" costs, based on outcome data derived from a previous study. For a 
long-term cost-effectiveness analysis, we created a simulation model to estimate 
life expectancy (quality-adjusted) and lifetime costs for a hypothetical cohort 
of major noncardiac surgical patients. Cost and outcome comparisons were made 
between postoperative goal-directed therapy and best standard therapy and 
described as cost/hospital survivor and cost/patient for the short-term analysis 
and as incremental cost/quality-adjusted life year for the long-term model. 
One-way, multiway, and probabilistic analyses were performed to address 
uncertainties in the model input values, and results were presented graphically 
in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.
SETTING: Simulation of a tertiary care department in the United Kingdom.
PATIENTS: A hypothetical cohort of high risk surgical patients.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients undergoing high-risk surgery were stratified to receive 
goal-directed therapy or standard best practice to improve tissue oxygenation in 
the postoperative setting.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In our short-term model, goal-directed therapy 
decreased costs by £2,631.77/patient and by £2,134.86/hospital survivor. The 
most sensitive variables were relative risk of complication and length of stay. 
When assuming the worst-case scenario (prolonged ICU and in-hospital stay, 
highest complication costs, and maximum cost for monitoring), goal-directed 
therapy still achieved cost savings (£471.70). Our findings also predict that 
goal-directed therapy not only prolongs quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.83 
yr or 9.8 mo) but also leads to incremental cost savings over a lifetime 
projection of £1,285.77, resulting in a negative incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of - £1,542.16/quality-adjusted life year.
CONCLUSION: The implementation of goal-directed therapy is both clinical and 
cost-effective. Additional implementation expenditures can be offset by savings 
due to reduced costs accrued from a reduction in complication rates and hospital 
length of stay. We conclude that goal-directed therapy provides significant 
benefits with respect to clinical and financial outcomes.

Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland.

BACKGROUND: With increased life expectancy, there is growing awareness of the 
effect of comorbidity on physiologic reserves in elderly patients. Data in the 
area of head and neck cancer surgery is lacking.
METHODS: Retrospective data from 61,740 elderly patients who underwent a head 
and neck cancer ablative surgery from 2001 to 2010 using the Nationwide 
Inpatient Sample were analyzed to examine associations between comorbidity and 
in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, length of hospitalization, 
and hospital-related costs.
RESULTS: Advanced comorbidity was present in 18% of elderly patients, who were 
more likely to experience acute medical complications (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; p < 
.001), in-hospital death (OR, 3.6; p < .001), increased length of 
hospitalization (mean, 2.2 days; p < .001), and hospital-related costs (mean, 
$6874; p < .001).
CONCLUSION: Advanced comorbidity in elderly surgical patients with head and neck 
cancer is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, length of 
hospitalization, and hospital-related costs. This increased utilization of 
health care resources may pose challenges to health care reform efforts as the 
population ages.

College, Vellore, India.

Osteochondromas are the most common benign tumors of the bone. They mostly arise 
from the appendicular skeleton and present clinically in the second or third 
decade of life. Ostechondromas arising from the subaxial cervical spine and 
presenting after the 5th decade of life are extremely rare. We report a 
52-year-old male patient who presented with numbness and subjective weakness of 
left upper and lower limbs and neck pain, and had lobulated bony hard fixed 
swelling in the right lower cervical paraspinal region. Radiological images 
revealed a bony swelling arising from C4 and C5 lamina with a cartilaginous cap 
and intraspinal extension. Excision biopsy with stabilisation of the spine was 
performed. Histopathalogical examination of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis 
of osteochondroma. We conclude surgical excision of such rare tumors, including 
the cartilaginous cap as well as the intraspinal component can reliably produce 
a good clinical outcome.

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Colorectal cancer is predominantly a disease of elderly 
people and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly 
population. The geriatric colorectal population is a very heterogeneous group, 
including patients with excellent health status and others with comorbid 
conditions, functional dependency, and limited life expectancy. On the other 
hand, the effectiveness of surgery for colorectal cancer depends on it being 
carried out safely, which allows most patients to return to productive lives, 
with an improved post-operative life expectancy or at least one that is not 
diminished by the surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work is a descriptive study of a retrospective 
cohort, based on administrative databases, of all patients with colorectal 
cancer diagnosed or treated in our institution. We extracted data on 
sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidity, type of cancer, stage of cancer, 
type of treatment received, post-operative complications and cause of 
post-operative death. We compared differences between an elderly group (Group A) 
(age >75 years) and a group of patients below 75 years (Group B).
RESULTS: We found that elderly patients with colorectal cancer were more likely 
to be operated in emergent conditions, had more non-specific complications and 
more post-operative mortality than patients below 75 years. On the other hand, 
tumours stages, tumours characteristics and post-operative specific morbidity 
have been proved to be similar, both in Group A and Group B patients.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that surgery is feasible and can be safe for 
patients above 75 years, but it needs much more evaluation of comorbidities, 
pre- and post-operative intensive care to avoid post-operative non-specific 
complications.

BACKGROUND: Determinants of health or health production function in health 
economics literature constitute noticeable issues in health promotion. This 
study aimed at estimating a health production function for East Mediterranean 
Region (EMR) based on the Grossman theoretical model.
METHODS: This ecological study was performed using the econometric methods. The 
panel data model was used in order to determine the relationship between life 
expectancy and socioeconomic factors. The data for 21 EMR countries between 1995 
and 2007 were used. Fixed-effect-model was employed to estimate the parameters 
based on Hausman test.
RESULTS: In estimating the health production function, factors such as income 
per capita (β=0.05, P<0.001), education index (β=0.07, P<0.001), food 
availability (β=0.01, P<0.001), level of urbanisation (β=0.10, P<0.001), and 
employment ratio (β=0.11, P<0.001) were specified as determinants of health 
status, proxied by life expectancy at birth. A notable result was the elasticity 
of life expectancy with respect to the employment rate and its significance 
level was different between males (β=0.13, P<0.001) and females (β=0.08, 
P>0.001).
