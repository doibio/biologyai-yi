STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of the Cervical Spine Research Society 
Outcomes Study, a longitudinal multicenter cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a statistical model for estimating health utility from the 
Cervical Spine Outcomes Questionnaire (CSOQ) domain scores.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is consensus among health-policy researchers 
that the results of economic evaluations of health can be reported in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). The CSOQ is a condition-specific instrument 
that assesses individuals across several domains, including neck and 
arm/shoulder pain and psychological distress.
METHODS: The CSOQ and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were 
prospectively administered before surgery (within 4 weeks) and after surgery (at 
3, 6, and 24 months) to individuals undergoing anterior cervical decompression 
and fusion for degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine. Using methods 
reported by Brazier et al, health utility (SF-6D) was estimated using the SF-36. 
Regression analyses were used on a training dataset (n = 164) to compute the 
SF-6D from the domain scores of the CSOQ. A validation dataset (n = 328) was 
used to estimate the SF-6D for comparison to the calculated health utility from 
the SF-36. RESULTS.: Domain scores were moderately correlated with health 
utility (SF-6D) (P < 0.001) with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.48 to 
0.70. The regression equation to predict SF-6D on the basis of CSOQ domain 
scores and patient age using the training dataset accounted for 65% of the 
variation in health utility. In the validation dataset, predicted SF-6D was 
positively correlated with observed SF-6D (r = 0.680, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the CSOQ's domain scores can be used to 
estimate health-utility scores among those undergoing elective anterior cervical 
decompression and fusion for cervical degenerative disc disease. The ability to 
assess health utility, coupled with the psychometric properties of the CSOQ, 
should increase the clinical utility of this patient-reported outcomes 
instrument.

[Anti-diabetic drugs. Weight reduction as a favourable side effect].

[Article in German]

Wirth A(1).

Author information:

The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the last years is 
mainly attributable to an increase in life expectancy and the high incidence of 
obesity. Nearly 90% of all type 2 diabetic patients in Germany are overweight or 
obese. The attributable risk of obesity in the development of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus is approximately 70%. Oral anti-diabetic drugs like sulfonylurea, 
glinides, and glitazones as well as insulin increase body weight within years by 
up to 8 kg with damaging side effects on cardiovascular organs. 
Dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors do not affect body weight and metformin 
as well as glucagon like peptid 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists decrease it. A 
reduction in body weight by changes in life style is effective but only a few 
overweight patients achieve the therapeutic goals. By using anti-diabetic drugs 
as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic compounds body weight, 
glycemic control and other cardiovascular risk factors may be influenced 
favorably.

[Usefulness of short tests in dementia screening].

[Article in Spanish]

España. avgalende@yahoo.es

INTRODUCTION: As life expectancy increases, and the prevalence of cognitive 
impairment and dementia continues to grow, the number of patients with cognitive 
complaints seen in primary care or specialized out-patient clinics has increased 
in the last few years. The assessment of these patients requires time, and a 
step-by-step organization to optimize medical resources.
DEVELOPMENT: This review presents the most important dementia screening tools 
with Spanish validation. We focus on those that are brief (less than ten 
minutes) and easy to use in primary care settings. Two groups of tests can be 
distinguished: brief cognitive tests and functional activities scales. The first 
can be considered a part of the mental status examination, and the second an 
organized history taking. Informant questionnaires and the possibility of 
self-administered cognitive tests are briefly reviewed.
CONCLUSION: There are no ideal screening tests. The election of the most 
appropriate will depend on the physiciańs time and knowledge of each test. It is 
advisable to be familiar with a reduced number of tests, and be aware of their 
strengths and limitations. Finally, we suggest personal recommendations for the 
most useful tests in each clinical setting.

Dr Scott Murphy was a leading authority in the science of platelet storage for 
transfusion. Among the first to advocate room-temperature storage, his work 
enabled the extension of platelet shelf life, which facilitated the development 
of aggressive medical and surgical therapies requiring intensive platelet 
support. During a 38-year career, he characterized the metabolism of stored 
platelets, worked to optimize storage conditions, and developed a landmark 
standard for the assessment of platelet quality. As a clinical hematologist, he 
was devoted to his patients, providing compassionate, comforting care. He was 
also a cherished mentor, a sage advisor, a fast friend, and a dedicated family 
man. Dr Murphy was one of those rare, great, humble men who inspire and enrich 
everyone around him. Truly one of transfusion medicine's leaders, Scott is 
remembered by those whose lives he touched for his warmth, wit, and wisdom.

Burrow extension with a proboscis: mechanics of burrowing by the glycerid 
Hemipodus simplex.

Murphy EA(1), Dorgan KM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 
94720, USA.

Burrowing marine infauna are morphologically diverse and ecologically important 
as ecosystem engineers. The polychaetes Nereis virens and Cirriformia moorei 
extend their burrows by crack propagation. Nereis virens does so by everting its 
pharynx and C. moorei, lacking an eversible pharynx or proboscis, uses its 
hydrostatic skeleton to expand its anterior. Both behaviors apply stress to the 
burrow wall that is amplified at the tip of the crack, which extends by 
fracture. That two species with such distinct morphologies and life histories 
both burrow by fracturing sediment suggests that this mechanism may be 
widespread among burrowers. We tested this hypothesis with the glycerid 
polychaete Hemipodus simplex, which has an eversible proboscis that is much 
longer and everts more rapidly than the pharynx of N. virens. When the proboscis 
is fully everted, the tip flares out wider than the rest of the proboscis, 
creating a shape and applying a stress distribution similar to that of N. virens 
and resulting in relatively large forces near the tip of the crack. These forces 
are larger than necessary to extend the crack by fracture and are surprisingly 
uncorrelated with the resulting stress amplification at the crack tip, which is 
also larger than necessary to extend the burrow by fracture. These large forces 
may plastically deform the mud, allowing the worm to build a semi-permanent 
burrow. Our results illustrate that similar mechanisms of burrowing are used by 
morphologically different burrowers.

Quantitative cancer risk assessment for ethylene oxide inhalation in 
occupational settings.

Valdez-Flores C(1), Sielken RL Jr, Teta MJ.

Author information:
(1)Sielken & Associates Consulting Inc, Bryan, TX 77802, USA.

The estimated occupational ethylene oxide (EO) exposure concentrations 
corresponding to specified extra risks are calculated for lymphoid mortality as 
the most appropriate endpoint, despite the lack of a statistically significant 
exposure-response relationship. These estimated concentrations are for 
occupational exposures--40 years of occupational inhalation exposure to EO from 
age 20 to age 60 years. The estimated occupational inhalation exposure 
concentrations (ppm) corresponding to specified extra risks of lymphoid 
mortality to age 70 years in a population of male and female EO workers are 
based on Cox proportional hazards models of the most recent updated epidemiology 
cohort mortality studies of EO workers and a standard life-table calculation. An 
occupational exposure at an inhalation concentration of 2.77 ppm EO is estimated 
to result in an extra risk of lymphoid mortality of 4 in 10,000 (0.0004) in the 
combined worker population of men and women from the two studies. The 
corresponding estimated concentration decreases slightly to 2.27 ppm when based 
on only the men in the updated cohorts combined. The difference in these 
estimates reflects the difference between combining all of the available data or 
focusing on only the men and excluding the women who did not show an increase in 
lymphoid mortality with EO inhalation exposure. The results of sensitivity 
analyses using other mortality endpoints (all lymphohematopoietic tissue 
cancers, leukemia) support the choice of lymphoid tumor mortality for estimation 
of extra risk.

Heterogeneity in the Strehler-Mildvan general theory of mortality and aging.

This study examines and further develops the classic Strehler-Mildvan (SM) 
general theory of mortality and aging. Three predictions from the SM theory are 
tested by examining the age dependence of mortality patterns for 42 countries 
(including developed and developing countries) over the period 1955-2003. By 
applying finite mixture regression models, principal component analysis, and 
random-effects panel regression models, we find that (1) the negative 
correlation between the initial adulthood mortality rate and the rate of 
increase in mortality with age derived in the SM theory exists but is not 
constant; (2) within the SM framework, the implied age of expected zero vitality 
(expected maximum survival age) also is variable over time; (3) longevity 
trajectories are not homogeneous among the countries; (4) Central American and 
Southeast Asian countries have higher expected age of zero vitality than other 
countries in spite of relatively disadvantageous national ecological systems; 
(5) within the group of Central American and Southeast Asian countries, a more 
disadvantageous national ecological system is associated with a higher expected 
age of zero vitality; and (6) larger agricultural and food productivities, 
higher labor participation rates, higher percentages of population living in 
urban areas, and larger GDP per capita and GDP per unit of energy use are 
important beneficial national ecological system factors that can promote 
survival. These findings indicate that the SM theory needs to be generalized to 
incorporate heterogeneity among human populations.

Cost-effectiveness of liraglutide versus rosiglitazone, both in combination with 
glimepiride in treatment of type 2 diabetes in the US.

Lee WC(1), Conner C, Hammer M.

USA. wclee@us.imshealth.com

BACKGROUND: Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not able to 
maintain adequate HbA(1c) control (<7.0%), even at maximal dosage levels of one 
or two oral agents, and are at increased risk for diabetes-related 
complications.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a once-daily GLP-1 analog 
Victoza [Novo Nordisk] versus a thiazolidinedione (TZD), rosiglitazone in 
patients with T2DM. Both treatment groups included background therapy with 
glimepiride.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) was used to project 
and compare 35-year clinical and economic outcomes associated with liraglutide 
1.2 mg + glimepiride and liraglutide 1.8 mg + glimepiride versus rosiglitazone 4 
mg + glimepiride. Baseline cohort characteristics (HbA(1c) (8.4%), age, duration 
of disease, sex, body-mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipids) were based 
on the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes-1 (LEAD-1) trial.
OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes included life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), total costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs). results: When compared to rosiglitazone, liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg 
increased mean LE by 0.968 and 1.041 years, and QALYs by 0.764 and 0.837, 
respectively. Total lifetime costs increased by $26,094 for liraglutide 1.2 mg 
versus rosiglitazone, and by $47,041 for liraglutide 1.8 mg versus 
rosiglitazone. ICERs for liraglutide 1.2 mg versus rosiglitazone and 1.8 mg 
versus rosiglitazone were $34,147 and $56,190, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to rosiglitazone 4 mg plus glimepiride, liraglutide 
(particularly at the 1.2-mg dose) plus glimepiride is a cost-effective treatment 
option for improving glucose control in T2DM. Limitations include the projection 
of short term efficacy results from randomized control trials to longer time 
horizons. In addition, clinical acceptance and overall use of rosiglitazone in 
the treatment of diabetes has continued to fall since publication of the 
clinical trial upon which this modeling analyses was based.

services.

OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' perceptions regarding prospective 
telerehabilitation services and the factors that facilitate or impede patients' 
intentions to use these services.
DESIGN: Using semi-structured interviews, patients reflected on the pros and 
cons of various scenarios of prospective telerehabilitation services. Patients' 
arguments were first arranged according to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and 
Use of Technology (UTAUT). Next, using inductive analysis, the data for each 
UTAUT component were analysed and arranged into subthemes.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five chronic pain patients were selected from a 
rehabilitation centre in the Netherlands.
RESULTS: Overall, participants considered telerehabilitation helpful as a 
complementary or follow-up treatment, rather than an autonomous treatment. 
Arguments mainly related to the UTAUT constructs of 'performance expectancy' and 
'facilitating conditions'. Patients valued the benefits such as reduced 
transportation barriers, flexible exercise hours and the possibility to better 
integrate skills into daily life. However, many patients feared a loss of 
treatment motivation and expressed concerns about both reduced fellow sufferer 
contact and reduced face-to-face therapist contact. Few arguments related to 
'social norms' and 'effort expectancy'.
CONCLUSIONS: The effect of telerehabilitation on healthcare strongly depends on 
patients' willingness to use. Our study showed that chronic pain patients valued 
the benefits of telerehabilitation but hesitate to use it as an autonomous 
treatment. Therefore, future initiatives should maintain traditional care to 
some degree and focus on patients' attitudes as well. Either by giving 
information to increase patients' confidence in telerehabilitation or by 
addressing reported drawbacks into the future design of these services. Further 
quantitative studies are needed to explore patients' intentions to use 
telerehabilitation.

China. leihc@moh.gov.cn

OBJECTIVE: To explore the socioeconomic factors associated with life expectancy 
in Beijing, and to predict future trends.
METHODS: The linear stepwise regression model was used to construct the 
relationship between life expectancy and socioeconomic factors.
RESULTS: The model showed that there were four factors associated with life 
expectancy in Beijing. Floor space available per rural resident (P = 0.000) and 
GDP per capita (P = 0.022) correlated positively with life expectancy, while the 
rural population proportion (P = 0.010) and illiteracy rate (P = 0.001) 
correlated negatively with life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: There is a close relationship between life expectancy and 
socioeconomic factors. The constructed model can be used as a rapid tool to 
project life expectancy in Beijing. It is possible to improve life expectancy 
continuously with sustained development of socioeconomic conditions in Beijing, 
China.

Free radical production, antioxidant capacity, and oxidative stress response 
signatures in fibroblasts from Lewis dwarf rats: effects of life span-extending 
peripubertal GH treatment.

The discovery that in invertebrates, disruption of the insulin/insulin-like 
growth factor (IGF)-1 pathway extends life span and increases resistance to 
oxidative injury led to the hypothesis that IGF-1 signaling may play a role in 
regulating cellular reactive oxygen species production, oxidative stress 
resistance, and consequentially, organismal life span in mammals. However, 
previous studies testing this hypothesis in rodent models of IGF-1 deficiency 
yielded controversial results. The Lewis dwarf rat is a useful model of human 
growth hormone (GH)/IGF-1 deficiency as it mimics many of the pathophysiological 
alterations present in human GH/IGF-1-deficient patients as well as elderly 
individuals. Peripubertal treatment of Lewis dwarf rats with GH results in a 
significant extension of life span. The present study was designed to test the 
role of the GH/IGF-1 axis in regulating cellular oxidative stress and oxidative 
stress resistance, utilizing primary fibroblasts derived from control rats, 
Lewis dwarf rats and GH-replete dwarf rats. Measurements of cellular 
dihydroethidium and C-H(2)DCFDA fluorescence showed that cellular O(2)(·-) and 
peroxide production were similar in each group. Fibroblasts from control and 
Lewis dwarf rats exhibited similar antioxidant capacities and comparable 
sensitivity to H(2)O(2), rotenone, high glucose, tunicamycin, thapsigargin, 
paraquat, and mitomycin, which cause apoptosis through increasing oxidative 
stress, mitochondrial damage, ATP depletion, and/or by damaging DNA, lipids and 
proteins. Fibroblasts from GH-replete rats exhibited significantly increased 
antioxidant capacities and superior resistance to H(2)O(2), rotenone and 
bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced cell death compared with cells from Lewis 
dwarf rats, whereas their sensitivity to the other stressors investigated was 
not statistically different. Thus, low circulating IGF-1 levels present in vivo 
in Lewis dwarf rats do not elicit long-lasting alterations in cellular reactive 
oxygen species generation and oxidative stress resistance, whereas life 
span-extending peripubertal GH treatment resulted in increased antioxidant 
capacity and increased resistance to cellular injury caused by some, but not 
all, oxidative stressors.

The value of early intervention in RA--a window of opportunity.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with progressive joint destruction, with 
functional status influenced by both disease activity and radiographic 
progression. The case for early aggressive treatment of RA is based on large 
amounts of good data in many countries. Studies with conventional 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in early RA have shown improved outcomes 
compared with later treatment, especially if an aggressive approach with 
combinations of drugs is used. Early intervention with tumour necrosis factor 
(TNF) inhibitors has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, induce remission 
and prevent radiographic progression. It also improves patients' functional 
status, health-related quality of life, and reduces fatigue. Patients with RA 
have reduced productivity, an increased number of lost work days and retire 
early; enabling patients to work should be at the core of a therapy's 
cost-effectiveness. Introduction of anti-TNF therapy early in RA has been shown 
to decrease job loss and reduce the amount of working time missed. Although the 
drug costs of initial treatment with combination therapy including a TNF 
inhibitor are high, these may be compensated by the reduction in lost 
productivity, making such a strategy cost-effective overall. In addition, some 
patients who respond well to combination therapy may be able to stop the TNF 
inhibitor. It is important to assess the benefits of any intervention not just 
to healthcare costs but to society as a whole, and physicians should be 
advocates for optimal access to effective therapies for their patients.

Survival of children following Nissen fundoplication.

Wockenforth R(1), Gillespie CS, Jaffray B.

Author information:
(1)Department of Paediatric Surgery, The Royal Victoria Infirmary, University of 
Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.

BACKGROUND: Analyses of survival after fundoplication in childhood are often 
restricted to 30-day mortality, or to the neurologically impaired. The objective 
of this study was to report actuarial survival and variables associated with 
mortality for all children undergoing fundoplication.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational study of fundoplication surgery by 
one surgeon; the endpoint was survival. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, 
gastrostomy, neurological status, tracheostomy, congenital cardiac disease, 
syndromic status, presence of congenital anomaly, other chronic disease, weight 
z-score at time of surgery, need for revisional fundoplication, use of 
laparoscopic surgery, gastric drainage procedures, age and sex were assessed for 
their influence on survival.
RESULTS: Two-hundred and thirty children underwent 255 fundoplications at a 
median age of 3·6 years. Forty-six children (20·0 per cent) died during a median 
follow-up of 2·8 (range 0·5-11·2) years. Statistical modelling showed 
gastrostomy (relative risk of death 11·04, P < 0·001), cerebral palsy (relative 
risk 6·58, P = 0·021) and female sex (relative risk 2·12, P = 0·015) to be 
associated with reduced survival. Revisional fundoplication was associated with 
improved survival (relative risk of death 0·37, P = 0·037). Survivors had 
significantly higher weight z-scores (-1·4 versus - 2·9 for those who died; P = 
0·001). The 5-year survival rate after fundoplication for children with cerebral 
palsy and gastrostomy was 59 per cent.
CONCLUSION: Survival of children following fundoplication is related principally 
to the presence of a gastrostomy and neurological status. Estimates of 
children's life expectancy should take account of the poorer survival of 
neurologically impaired children who undergo fundoplication, presumably due to 
the related co-morbidities that lead to a gastrostomy.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of carotid stenting vs. carotid 
endarterectomy using data from the SAPPHIRE trial.
BACKGROUND: Carotid stenting with embolic protection has been introduced as an 
alternative to carotid endarterectomy for prevention of cerebrovascular and 
cardiovascular events among patients at increased surgical risk.
METHODS: Between August 2000 and July 2002, 310 patients with an accepted 
indication for carotid endarterectomy but at high risk of complications were 
randomized to and subsequently underwent either carotid stenting (n = 159) or 
endarterectomy (n = 151). Clinical outcomes, resource use, costs, and quality of 
life were assessed prospectively for all patients over a 1-year period. Life 
expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and health care costs beyond the 
follow-up period were estimated for patients alive at 1 year, based on observed 
clinical events during the first year of follow-up.
RESULTS: Although initial procedural costs were significantly higher for 
stenting than for endarterectomy (mean difference: $4,081/patient; 95% CI, 
$3,849-$4,355), mean post-procedure length of stay was shorter for stenting (1.9 
vs. 2.9 days; P < 0.001) with significant associated cost offsets. As a result, 
initial hospital costs were just $559/patient higher with stenting (95% CI, 
$3,470 less to $2,289 more). Neither follow-up costs after discharge nor total 
1-year costs differed significantly. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
for stenting compared with endarterectomy was $6,555 per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained, with over 98 percent of bootstrap estimates < $50,000/QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Although carotid stenting with embolic protection is more costly 
than carotid endarterectomy, by commonly accepted standards, stenting is an 
economically attractive alternative to endarterectomy for patients at high 
surgical risk.

In the two decades since AZT was first approved for clinical use in 1987, 24 
additional antiretroviral agents have been approved. They include 7 nucleoside 
analogs, a nucleotide analog and 4 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors, 10 protease inhibitors, 2 entry inhibitors and an integrase 
inhibitor. More than 20 investigational agents are currently being studied in 
clinical trials. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which involves a 
combination of anti-HIV-1 drugs, is extremely effective in suppressing HIV-1 
replication and increasing CD4+ number and results in substantial reductions in 
HIV-1-related morbidity and mortality. In last 20 years, much has been learned 
about resistance to antiretroviral drugs, drug interactions and metabolic 
complications of antiviral drug use. Drugs are now selected on the basis of 
resistance tests and on the risk of specific drug complications in individual 
patients. As a result, decisions about the therapy of HIV/AIDS have become 
personalized and are made on a patient-by-patient basis. With appropriate 
medical management, a person with HIV-1 now has the possibility of a nearly 
normal life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the treatment and effects of wrist arthroscopy in tear of 
triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).
METHODS: Between January 2006 and December 2008, 16 patients with tear of TFCC 
were treated. Of 16 patients, 11 were male and 5 were female with an average age 
of 32.5 years (range, 25-51 years). Injury was caused by sprain in 12 cases, and 
by falling in 4 cases. The locations were the left side in 10 cases and the 
right side in 6 cases. The mean injury duration was 3 months to 6 years and 2 
months. The main clinical symptoms included wrist powerlessness and ulnar-sided 
wrist pain which was aggravated with clench fist and lifting heavy things. The 
results of the ulnar-sided wrist stress test were positive in 14 cases and 
negative in 2 cases. The preoperative values of wrist range of motion (ROM) were 
(45.58 +/- 5.18) degrees at volar flexion, (41.22 +/- 3.83) degrees at dorsal 
extension, (17.82 +/- 2.48) degrees at radial deviation, (21.35 +/- 4.61) 
degrees at ulnar deviation, (69.85 +/- 8.36) degrees at pronation, and (70.13 
+/- 6.34) degrees at supination. According to Palmer standard, 10 cases of IA 
were treated with debridement; 3 cases of IB with suture and 1 of them failed 
and was partially excised; 2 cases of IC with debridement on triangular 
fibrocartilage disc, ulnolunate ligament, and ulnotriguetrum ligament; and 1 
case of ID with trimming plastic operation.
RESULTS: All incisions healed by first intention, and no complications of joint 
infection or neurovascular injury was found. All patients were followed up 14-38 
months (mean, 18.5 months). Fifteen patients were restored to normal life and 
work without ulnar-sided wrist pain. One patient had no pain, but he had wrist 
powerless. The values of ROM at last follow-up were (50.16 +/- 6.21) degrees at 
volar flexion, (45.37 +/- 4.65) degrees at dorsal extension, (18.95 +/- 3.56) 
degrees at radial deviation, (26.28 +/- 5.09) degrees at ulnar deviation, (78.87 
+/- 7.69) degrees at pronation, and (76.46 +/- 8.31) degrees at supination; 
showing significant differences when compared with preoperative values (P < 
0.05). According to Green-O'Brien standard, the results were excellent in 9 
cases, good in 6 cases, fair in 1 case, and the excellent and good rate was 
93.75%.
CONCLUSION: The wrist arthroscopy not only can definitely diagnose tear of TFCC, 
but also is useful for treatment. In addition, the incision is small and the 
function is easy to recover, and the occurrence of chronic ulnar-sided wrist 
pain can be effectively avoided.

Rufinamide for pediatric patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: a comprehensive 
overview.

Wier HA(1), Cerna A, So TY.

Greensboro, NC 27401, USA.

Rufinamide is a triazole derivative with broad-spectrum antiepileptic effects 
that is unrelated to any antiepileptic drug currently on the market. The 
European Commission and the US FDA approved rufinamide in 2007 and 2008, 
respectively, for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children 4 years of age or older and adults. The 
mechanism of action of rufinamide is not completely understood but it is 
believed to prolong the inactive state of sodium channels, therefore limiting 
excessive firing of sodium-dependent action potentials. Rufinamide is well 
absorbed when taken with food, with an absolute bioavailability between 70% and 
85%. The elimination half-life of the drug is around 6-10 hours, with a time to 
maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of approximately 4-6 hours. The C(max) at 
a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day and 30 mg/kg/day is 4.01 μg/mL and 8.68 μg/mL, 
respectively, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 
to 12 hours was 37.8 ± 47 μg · h/mL and 89.3 ± 58 μg · h/mL, respectively. 
Rufinamide exerts non-linear pharmacokinetics with increasing doses. The volume 
of distribution in children is similar to that in adults (0.8-1.2 L/kg) and the 
drug binds rather poorly to plasma protein (26.2-34.8%). Rufinamide is mainly 
metabolized by carboxylesterases to an inactive metabolite (CGP 47292), and the 
majority of the metabolites are excreted in the urine (91%). No dosage 
adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. Rufinamide does not 
affect the plasma concentration of other antiepileptics, but phenytoin, 
phenobarbital, valproate, and primidone affect the clearance of rufinamide. In a 
clinical study of 138 patients averaging 12 years of age, rufinamide used as an 
adjunctive therapy (with an initial dosage of 10 mg/kg/day up to a target dosage 
of 45 mg/kg/day) in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome reduced the median 
total seizure frequency by 32.7% versus 11.7% in the placebo group (p = 0.0015). 
Similar reduction in total seizure frequency was maintained in the extension 
phase of this study. In other studies, rufinamide also seemed to provide 
improvement in both partial seizures and refractory epilepsy, but further 
studies need to validate this observation and to identify its clinical 
significance. Rufinamide is usually started orally at 10 mg/kg/day, titrating up 
by 10 mg/kg/day every 2 days to a target dosage of 45 mg/kg/day divided twice 
daily (maximum dosage of 3200 mg/day). Dosing of rufinamide has not been 
established in patients <4 years of age. Rufinamide is available as 100, 200, 
and 400 mg tablets in Europe, and 200 and 400 mg tablets in the US; a suspension 
of 40 mg/mL can be prepared extemporaneously. Rufinamide is well tolerated, with 
the most common adverse effects being dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
diplopia, and somnolence. From the current data, rufinamide serves as an 
adjunctive therapy in the management of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Further studies 
need to evaluate its efficacy as a first-line agent in the management of this 
neurologic disorder.

Darunavir boosted with ritonavir (DRV/r) in combination with other 
antiretrovirals (ARVs) was initially approved in 2006 for the treatment of HIV 
infection in ARV treatment-experienced adults and has subsequently been approved 
for use in treatment-naive adults in 2008. Clinical studies have shown that 
DRV/r in combination with other ARVs achieves superior levels of undetectable 
plasma HIV RNA and generates significant CD4 increases, which reduce the risk of 
HIV disease progression. Economic evaluations, based on data from controlled 
clinical trials, found DRV/r combination therapy to generate savings in hospital 
costs and other non-ARV costs of care in treatment-experienced patients, to 
maximize the number of patients reaching undetectable plasma HIV RNA, to improve 
health-related quality of life and quality-adjusted life expectancy, and to be 
cost effective across different patient populations.

Does adjusting for health-related quality of life matter in economic evaluations 
of cancer-related interventions?

Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA,

AIMS: We investigated the extent to which adjusting for health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) alters incremental cost per life-year gained ratios, and the 
implications for reimbursement decisions.
METHODS: We identified all cancer-related interventions in the Tufts Medical 
Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry in which both a 
cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and a cost/life-year ratio were reported 
in the same study. We assessed the ordinal relationship between these ratios and 
analyzed the extent to which using a cost/QALY rather than a cost/life-year 
ratio would potentially yield different reimbursement decisions.
RESULTS: The rank-order correlation between cost/life-year and cost/QALY ratio 
pairs was 0.917 (p < 0.0001). In 78.8% of comparisons, both cost/QALY and 
cost/life-year ratios were below a prespecified threshold (e.g., US$50,000 per 
QALY or life-year). Adjusting for HRQoL resulted in a higher ratio such that it 
crossed a prespecified threshold in 18.6% of interventions. The data suggest 
that adjusting life-years for HRQoL does not substantively affect cost per 
life-year ratios for the vast majority of cancer-related interventions.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis implies that the method used for HRQoL adjusting or 
even HRQoL adjusting at all does not matter for most reimbursement decisions on 
life-saving interventions. The results could differ for interventions that have 
large impacts on patients' HRQoL compared with the impact on survival.

Current status of agents active against the T315I chronic myeloid leukemia 
phenotype.

(1)HRB Clinical Research Facility, National University of Ireland Galway and 
Trinity College Dublin, Ireland.

INTRODUCTION: T315I is a genetic mutation of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, the 
pathogenetic abnormality in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It accounts for 10 ? 
15% of clinically relevant CML mutations. Licensed tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
are ineffective against this mutation and its development reduces life 
expectancy of CML in chronic phase from 10 years to just 22 months. Extensive 
work is ongoing to establish the most effective therapy to overcome this 
mutation, including the development of novel specific agents and also 
re-examination of established therapies.
AREAS COVERED: This review examines the agents in development, dividing them 
into Bcr-Abl-dependant and -independent groups. It looks at the progress of this 
research, updating the reader on the status of agents previously reported and 
introducing emerging therapeutic possibilities only recently announced.
EXPERT OPINION: Development of the T315I mutation is a devastating event for 
some patients with CML. There are potential therapeutic agents at all stages of 
the drug development cycle to target this patient subpopulation. Clinical 
activity has been demonstrated and a number of agents are on the cusp of being 
licensed and available for use.

Modeling the cost-effectiveness of prothrombin complex concentrate compared with 
fresh frozen plasma in emergency warfarin reversal in the United kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Warfarin is the most commonly used oral anticoagulant in the United 
Kingdom. Indications for its long-term use include recurrent venous thrombosis, 
prosthetic heart valves, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, valvular 
heart disease, and prosthetic heart valve replacement.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of using 
prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) compared with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) 
for emergency warfarin reversal in patients with a life-threatening 
intracranial, gastrointestinal, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
METHODS: Mortality estimates associated with managing an intracranial, 
gastrointestinal, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage were obtained from published 
studies after a systematic literature search. Estimates of health care resource 
use pertaining to managing warfarin-treated patients after a life-threatening 
hemorrhage were provided by 11 consultant physicians with experience in warfarin 
reversal. These published clinical outcomes and clinician-derived health care 
resource use estimates were used to construct a decision model depicting the 
treatment patterns and associated resource use attributable to current 
management of a hypothetical cohort of adults undergoing emergency warfarin 
reversal as a result of an intracranial, gastrointestinal, or retroperitoneal 
hemorrhage in the United Kingdom. The model only considered direct health care 
costs borne by the secondary care sector of the National Health Service, and not 
those borne in the community (with the exception of the cost of stroke 
rehabilitation) and estimated the cost effectiveness of using PCC compared with 
FFP to reverse the anticoagulant effects of warfarin, from the perspective of 
the National Health Service, at 2007-2008 prices.
RESULTS: The cost of warfarin reversal was estimated to be ≤ 15% of the total 
cost of managing a patient after a life-threatening intracranial, 
gastrointestinal, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The cost per life-year gained 
with PCC was estimated to range from £1000 to £2000, depending on hemorrhage 
type (ie, intracranial, gastrointestinal, or retroperitoneal). The cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained with PCC was estimated at £3000 or less 
depending on hemorrhage type.
CONCLUSION: PCC appeared to be a more cost-effective treatment than FFP for the 
emergency reversal of warfarin, from the perspective of the UK National Health 
Service, in this model analysis.

Immortalisation of normal human urothelial cells compromises differentiation 
capacity.

Georgopoulos NT(1), Kirkwood LA, Varley CL, MacLaine NJ, Aziz N, Southgate J.

Author information:

University of York, York, UK.

BACKGROUND: The development of urothelial malignancy is not solely a consequence 
of loss of proliferation constraints but also involves loss of cellular 
differentiation, defined histopathologically as grade. Although tumour grade is 
an independent prognostic marker for urothelial carcinoma (UC), the molecular 
events underpinning the loss of urothelial differentiation are poorly 
understood.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of gene alterations implicated in UC 
development on the ability of human urothelial cells to undergo molecular 
differentiation and form a functional urothelial barrier.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Laboratory study.
INTERVENTION: Normal human urothelial (NHU) cell cultures were transduced with 
recombinant retroviruses to produce stable sublines overexpressing wild-type or 
oncogenic mutated fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 or human telomerase 
reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Previously generated NHU sublines carrying 
dominant-negative CDK4 and p53 mutant genes or immortalised with the human 
papillomavirus 16 E6 oncoprotein were included.
MEASUREMENTS: The activity of introduced transgenes was demonstrated by 
comparing phenotypes of transgene-expressing and isogenic control NHU cells. 
Modified and control sublines were compared for changes in generational 
potential (life span) and capacity to respond to differentiation-inducing 
signals by transcript expression of uroplakins 2 and 3. The ability to form a 
barrier epithelium was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical 
resistance.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: By contrast to tumour suppressor loss of function or 
oncogene overactivation, hTERT overexpression alone led to life span extension 
and immortalisation. The hTERT immortalised cells carried no gross genomic 
alterations but became progressively insensitive to differentiation signals and 
lost the ability to form an epithelial barrier. Further characterisation of 
hTERT cells revealed a downregulation of p16 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 
expression and loss of responsiveness to peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor γ, providing mechanistic explanations for the subjugation of senescence 
constraints and the abrogation of differentiation capability, respectively. 
Although immortalised urothelial cell lines without karyotypic aberrations may 
be generated, such cell lines are compromised in terms of differentiation and 
functional capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of hTERT promotes development of an immortalised 
differentiation-insensitive urothelial cell phenotype. Although such cells offer 
a useful insight into the grade/stage paradigm of UC, they have limited value 
for investigating normal urothelial cell/tissue biology and physiology.

Income and risk of mortality after spinal cord injury.

Krause JS(1), Saunders LL, DeVivo MJ.

Author information:
(1)College of Health Professions, Medical University of South Carolina, 
Charleston, SC, USA. krause@musc.edu

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of household income and formal education 
with risk of mortality after spinal cord injury (SCI).
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Twenty hospitals designated as Model SCI Systems of care in the United 
States.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (N=8027) with traumatic SCI, seen in one of the Model SCI 
Systems, who had at least 1 follow-up assessment between 1995 and 2006. All 
participants were at least 1 year postinjury at the time of assessment. There 
were 57,957 person-years and 1036 deaths. The follow-up period started with the 
first assessment between 1995 and 2006 and went until either the date of death 
or March 2009.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality status was determined by routine follow-up 
supplemented by using the Social Security Death Index. A logistic regression 
model was developed to estimate the chance of dying in any given year.
RESULTS: Educational status and income were significantly predictive of 
mortality after adjusting for age, sex, race, and severity of injury. Compared 
with those with household income of $75,000 or greater, the odds of mortality 
was greater for those who had income between $25,000 and $75,000 (1.61) and 
still higher for those with less than $25,000 a year (2.41). Life expectancy 
differed more as a function of household income than the economic subscale of 
the Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique.
CONCLUSION: There was a clear gradation in survival based on familial income 
(high, middle, low), not just an effect of the lowest income.
