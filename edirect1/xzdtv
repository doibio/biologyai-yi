The WHO European Region has the lowest exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates at 6 
months in the world. In Austria, 55.5% of infants are EBF at the age of one 
week, although breastfeeding initiation is 97.5%. The study was conducted in 
2019/2020 and considered 1214 mothers of legal age, who received four online 
questionnaires during their child's first year of life. The influence of 
different variables on total/exclusive breastfeeding duration were analysed by 
using a Cox model (Extension of the Cox Proportional Hazards Model) with 
time-dependent covariates. Multivariate analyses showed a significant influence 
of maternal BMI, lifestyle factors, such as smoking, and breastfeeding support 
on total breastfeeding duration. Remarkable differences in the median duration 
of any breastfeeding were found for breastfeeding support, where mothers 
breastfed twice as long. Support came primarily from hospital staff, the midwife 
and the partner. A higher monthly household net income, delivery in a 
baby-friendly certified hospital (BFH) and breastfeeding support were associated 
with a longer EBF duration. Obese mothers started feeding infant formula earlier 
and had a higher risk of early weaning. The results offer valuable insights into 
the importance of breastfeeding-friendly structures such as BFHs, a focus on 
breastfeeding aftercare and support of the mother to promote and protect 
breastfeeding.

As life expectancy increases, age-associated diseases such as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) become a major health problem. The onset of AD involves 
neurological dysfunction due to amyloid-β accumulation, tau 
hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in the brain. In 
addition, lifestyle-related diseases-such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, 
and vascular dysfunction-increase the risk of developing dementia. The world 
population ages, prompting the development of new strategies to maintain brain 
health and prevent the onset of dementia in older and preclinical patients. 
Citrus fruits are abundant polymethoxylated flavone and flavanone sources. 
Preclinical studies reported that these compounds have neuroprotective effects 
in models of dementia such as AD. Interestingly, clinical and epidemiological 
studies appear to support preclinical evidence and show improved cognitive 
function and reduced associated disease risk in healthy individuals and/or 
patients. This review summarizes the recent evidence of the beneficial effects 
of citrus peels and extracts on human cognition and related functions.

Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is a widely consumed nutraceutical with various 
health benefits supported by scientific evidence. However, its indirect health 
impacts through the gut microbiota have not been studied. Caenorhabditis elegans 
is a useful model to study both the direct and indirect effects of 
nutraceuticals, as the intimate association of the worm with the metabolites 
produced by Escherichia coli is a prototypic simplified model of our gut 
microbiota. We prepared an ethanoic extract of guarana seeds and assessed its 
antioxidant capacity in vitro, with a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) 
assay, and in vivo, utilizing C. elegans. Additionally, we studied the impact of 
this extract on C. elegans lifespan, utilizing both viable and non-viable E. 
coli, and assessed the impact of guarana on E. coli folate production. The 
extract showed high antioxidant capacity, and it extended worm lifespan. 
However, the antioxidant and life-extending effects did not correlate in terms 
of the extract concentration. The extract-induced life extension was also less 
significant when utilizing dead E. coli, which may indicate that the effects of 
guarana on the worms work partly through modifications on E. coli metabolism. 
Following this observation, guarana was found to decrease E. coli folate 
production, revealing one possible route for its beneficial effects.

BACKGROUND: Soil-dwelling human pathogens like Salmonella are transmitted by 
fresh produce such as tomato, spinach, onion and cabbage. With >2600 serovars, 
it is difficult to classify the good plant colonizers from the non-colonizers. 
Generally, soil microbiota are classified as autochthonous or zymogenous 
organisms, based on their ability to survive in soil. However, such information 
for soil-dwelling human pathogens is not available Thus there is a need to 
classify these organisms for designing a strategy to prevent their outbreak. 
Moreover, soil harbours a plethora of microbes, which can be screened for 
competitive organisms to control such human pathogens.
RESULTS: In this study, we examined whether the morphotype based on the 
attachment factors (e.g., cellulose and curli fimbri) of Salmonella was 
important for its colonization of roots. Secondly, we tracked the location of 
the bacteria in the plant cell. Interestingly, most of the epidermal cells 
occupied by Salmonella showed propidium iodide-positive nuclei. As an extension 
of the study, a screening of competitive rhizospheric bacteria was performed. 
One isolate, identified as Lysinibacillus macroides, was able to inhibit the 
biofilm of Salmonella and subsequently reduced its colonization on roots.
CONCLUSION: Based on this study, we classified the Rdar (red, dry and rough) 
morphotypes as good plant colonists. The ability to colonize and subsequent kill 
the live plant cell throws light on the zymogenous life cycle of soil-dwelling 
Salmonella. Additionally, Lysinibacillus macroides served as a biocontrol agent 
by reducing the burden of Salmonella in various vegetables. Such organisms can 
further be explored to prevent contamination of the food chain. © 2022 Society

PURPOSE: Reduction and fixation of tibial plateau fractures associated with 
small, "floating" intra-articular fragments proposes a challenge. We use fully 
threaded headless compression screws for (interfragmentary) fixation of such 
fragments before final plate fixation when standard fixation of intra-articular 
fragments with k-wires or lag screws is deemed insufficient. Our aim is to 
describe our technique and clinical experience of this two-level fixation.
METHODS: Between 2006 and 2021, 29 patients with a comminuted tibial plateau 
fracture were treated with this two-level fixation in this retrospective case 
series. Clinical baseline and surgical variables were collected for all 
patients. Clinical outcome variables were available for 28 patients with a 
median follow-up of 16.5 months (IQR 5-24). Functional outcomes were measured 
with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and reported by 22 
patients at a median of 5.2 years (IQR 3.5-9.8).
RESULTS: Reduction was anatomic or good in 82% of cases, fair in 14%, and a 
malreduction in 4%. Arthrosis was graded as grade 0 in 25% of cases, 1 in 39%, 2 
in 21%, and 3 in 14%. Flexion was 110 degrees (IQR 100-130). Five patients had 
an extension deficit of 5 to 10 degrees. Median KOOS for symptoms and stiffness 
was 69 points (IQR 45-78), for pain 71 (IQR 45-88), for ADL 85 (IQR 52-95), for 
sports 30 (IQR 11-55), and for quality of life 34 (IQR 19-56).
CONCLUSION: The use of fully threaded headless compression screws is a simple 
and helpful addition in the treatment of comminuted tibial plateau fractures.

PURPOSE: Describe and predict the malignant tumor deaths in Xi'an so as to 
provide evidence for the government to formulate the prevention and treatment 
plans.
METHODS: Overall malignant tumor death in Xi'an in the past 16 years was 
described. The multi-decrease life table was used to calculate cumulative 
mortality risk by cause and life expectancy reduction years by cause of 
malignant tumors in 2020. The join point regression models were used to analyze 
the change trend of standard mortality of malignant tumors in Xi'an from 2005 to 
2020. The appropriate gray models were selected to predict the death of 
malignant tumors in Xi'an in the next decade.
RESULTS: The mortality of total malignant tumors in Xi'an showed that men are 
higher than women and the elderly are higher than other groups. As for 2020, 
lung cancer had the highest risk of death for both men and women, while leukemia 
had the highest life expectancy reduction years by cause. From 2005 to 2020, 
standardized mortality of majority malignant tumors showed downward trends, 
which were particularly obvious in recent years. The prediction results of 
several major malignant tumors showed that in the next decade, the mortality of 
most malignant tumors had downward trends, but combined with the increase of 
population in the future, the number of malignant tumor deaths in Xi'an will 
continue to increase.
CONCLUSIONS: Malignant tumors in Xi'an have decreasing mortality trends in 
recent years, and effective measures to prevent and treat tumors should be 
strengthened in the future.

In medicinal chemistry, hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts produce 
analogue series (ASs), the analysis of which is of central relevance for the 
exploration and exploitation of structure-activity relationships (SARs) and 
generation of candidate compounds. The key question in any chemical optimization 
effort is which analogue(s) to generate next, for which computational support is 
typically provided through QSAR analysis and compound potency predictions. In 
this study, we introduce a new chemical language model for analogue design via 
deep learning. For this purpose, ASs comprising active compounds are ordered 
according to increasing potency and the chemical language model predicts 
preferred R-groups for new analogues on the basis of ordered R-group sequences. 
Hence, consistent with the principles of deep models for natural language 
processing, analogues with new R-groups are predicted based upon conditional 
probabilities taking preceding groups into account. This implicitly accounts for 
the potency gradient captured by an AS and detectable SAR trends, providing a 
new concept for analogue design. Herein, we report the AS-based chemical 
language model, its initial evaluation, and exemplary applications.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical, potentially life-threatening 
finding on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional chest imaging. Timely and accurate 
diagnosis of thrombus acuity and extent directly influences patient management, 
and outcomes. Technical and interpretive pitfalls may present challenges to the 
radiologist, and by extension, pose nuance in the development and integration of 
artificial intelligence support tools. This review delineates imaging 
considerations for diagnosis of acute PE, and rationale, hurdles and 
applications of artificial intelligence for the PE task.

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a mental disorder that typically emerges in late 
adolescence or early adulthood. It reduces the life expectancy of patients by 15 
years. Abnormal behavior, perception of emotions, social relationships, and 
reality perception are among its most significant symptoms. Past studies have 
revealed that SZ affects the temporal and anterior lobes of hippocampus regions 
of the brain. Also, increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and decreased 
volume of white and gray matter can be observed due to this disease. Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) is the popular neuroimaging technique used to explore 
structural/functional brain abnormalities in SZ disorder, owing to its high 
spatial resolution. Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been 
employed with advanced image/signal processing methods to accurately diagnose 
SZ. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of studies conducted on the 
automated diagnosis of SZ using MRI modalities. First, an AI-based computer 
aided-diagnosis system (CADS) for SZ diagnosis and its relevant sections are 
presented. Then, this section introduces the most important conventional machine 
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in the diagnosis of diagnosing 
SZ. A comprehensive comparison is also made between ML and DL studies in the 
discussion section. In the following, the most important challenges in 
diagnosing SZ are addressed. Future works in diagnosing SZ using AI techniques 
and MRI modalities are recommended in another section. Results, conclusion, and 
research findings are also presented at the end.

The ability to adapt to environmental and task demands while walking is critical 
to independent mobility outside the home and this ability wanes with age. Such 
adaptability requires individuals to acutely change their walking speed. 
Regardless of age, changes between walking speeds are common in daily life, and 
are a frequent type of walking adaptability. Here, we report on older and 
younger adults when transitioning from preferred walking speed overground to 
either slower or faster walking. Specifically, we evaluated biomechanical 
parameters prior to, during, and post transition. Individuals approached the 
walking speed transition similarly, independent of whether the transition was to 
slower or faster walking. Regardless of age or walking speed, the step during 
which a walking speed transition occurred was distinct from those prior- and 
post- transition, with on average 0.15 m shorter step lengths, 3.6° more hip 
flexion, and 3.3° more dorsiflexion during stance. We also found that peak hip 
flexion occurred 22% later, and peak hip extension (39%), knee flexion (26%), 
and dorsiflexion (44%) occurred earlier in stance for both typical to slower and 
typical to faster walking. Older adults had altered timing of peak joint angles 
compared with younger adults across both acceleration and deceleration 
conditions, indicating age-dependent responses to changing walking speed. Our 
findings are an important first step in establishing values for kinematics 
during walking speed transitions in younger and typical older adults.

Waste electronic and electrical equipment are complex mixtures of valuable 
and/or toxic materials, which pose serious challenges in their recycling or 
disposal, for example, electrical transmission wires insulated in polyvinyl 
chloride materials. These materials are frequently found contaminated with toxic 
chemical elements, such as Pb, Hg, Cr, or Cd, and are discarded without 
decontamination. To resolve this problem, we developed a microwave-assisted 
extraction process to remove toxic metals from plastic e-waste. We processed 
diluted (30 wt%) citric acid at 210 °C for 1 h inside a pressurized vessel 
heated by microwave, and found it was suitable not only for the extraction of 
the toxic metals (∼100%) but also for a significant plastic recovery (>50 wt%). 
To predict an optimized process window, the support vector regression machine 
learning algorithm was applied, which reduced the amount of experimentation 
required while still giving accurate results. Conditions optimized for the 
reference sample also led to maximum extraction of toxic metals from real-life 
extension cord waste. We also report that the recovered plastic's properties 
remained intact after the extraction.

Background: Active surveillance (AS) has been established as an alternative to 
immediate surgery for low-risk papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). 
Nonetheless, it remains difficult to decide between AS and immediate surgery, 
since limited objective evidence exists regarding risks and benefits. The aim of 
study is to compare the cumulative costs of AS and immediate surgery. Methods: 
To estimate cumulative costs, a hypothetical model is simulated based on the 
Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study of Active Surveillance on Papillary Thyroid 
Micro-Carcinoma (MAeSTro) study, a multicenter prospective cohort study of AS 
for PTMC. Direct and indirect costs are estimated from diagnosis to the 
treatment decision and follow-up for 10 years and a longer period. In the case 
of the scenarios, AS, AS to surgery due to changing their mind, and lobectomy 
(analyzed regardless of levothyroxine [LT4] treatment, as well as subdivided 
into lobectomy/LT4[-] and lobectomy/LT4[+]) are considered. A sensitivity 
analysis is performed using different discount rates to address uncertainties in 
future time costs. To compare the cumulative costs, we referred to previous 
research conducted in Hong Kong, the United States, and Japan. Results: The 
initial cost of AS is estimated to be 5.6 times lower than that of lobectomy 
(regardless of LT4 use), while the 10-year cumulative costs of AS ($2545) and 
lobectomy regardless of LT4 ($3045) are similar under a discount rate of 3%. 
However, in the long-term follow-up period, immediate surgery is going to be 
estimated more economical than AS. The costs of the two management approaches 
are similar in Hong Kong, but substantially different in the United States and 
Japan, implying that it could be affected by each country's national health 
insurance coverage and the thyroid ultrasound interval during follow-up. 
Conclusion: Considering both direct and indirect costs, the cumulative costs of 
AS and immediate surgery in low-risk PTMC patients are similar during 10 years, 
and surgery could be more economical for patients with a life expectancy in 
long-term follow-up. However, careful interpretation is needed for long-term 
follow-up and the country's health care system and environment. Nevertheless, 
considering the representative protocols and objective costs in South Korea, it 
is expected to be a key to suggest the appropriate treatment for PTMC patients.

Glioblastoma is an aggressive malignant tumor of the brain and spinal cord. Due 
to the blood-brain barrier, the accessibility of its treatments still remains 
significantly challenging. Unfortunately, the recurrence rates of glioblastoma 
upon surgery are very high too. Hence, understanding the molecular drivers of 
disease progression is valuable. In this study, we aimed to investigate the 
molecular drivers responsible for glioblastoma progression and identify valid 
biomarkers. Three microarray expression profiles GSE90604, GSE50601, and 
GSE134470 containing healthy and glioblastoma-affected samples revealed 
overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The interrelational pathway 
enrichment analysis elucidated the halt of cell cycle checkpoints and activation 
of signaling pathways and led to the identification of 6 predominant hub genes. 
Validation of hub genes in comparison with The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets 
identified the potential biomarkers of glioblastoma. The study evaluated two 
significantly upregulated genes, SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in 
cysteine) and VIM (vimentin) for glioblastoma. The genes CACNA1E (calcium 
voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 e), SH3GL2 (SH3 domain-containing GRB2-like 
2, endophilin A1), and DDN (dendrin) were identified as under-expressed genes as 
compared to the normal and pan-cancer tissues along with prominent putative 
prognostic biomarker potentials. The genes DDN and SH3GL2 were found to be 
upregulated in the proneural subtype, while CACNA1E in the mesenchymal subtype 
of glioblastoma exhibits good prognostic potential. The mutational analysis also 
revealed the benign, possibly, and probably damaging substitution mutations. The 
correlation between the DEG and survival in glioblastoma was evaluated using the 
Kaplan-Meier plots, and VIM had a greater life expectancy of 60.25 months. 
Overall, this study identified key candidate genes that might serve as 
predictive biomarkers for glioblastoma.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic diseases 
today, and its prevalence and incidence are expected to increase as life 
expectancy increases. By investigating the inhibition of long non-coding RNA 
maternally expressed gene 3 (lncRNA MEG3) in OA, we hope to provide some new 
insights into the treatment of osteoarthritis.
METHODS: By constructing an osteoarthritis model, the knee joint tissue of the 
model was observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and computed 
tomography (CT). Detection of miR-34a and Klotho expression by fluorescent 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot. The lncRNA MEG3 
overexpression vector was constructed and transfected into C28/I2 cells. Reverse 
transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to 
detect the results of lncRNA MEG3 and miR-34a expression in each group of cells, 
and Western blot was used to detect the results of Klotho, recombinant 
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), BCL2-associated 
X (Bax), Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), cysteinyl aspartate 
specific proteinase 3 (Caspase3) and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 8 
(Caspase8) protein expression.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, HE and CT results showed significant 
pathological changes in the knee joint of the osteoarthritis model mice. and 
Klotho expression was significantly decreased and miR-34a expression was 
significantly increased in the model group (P<0.05). Compared with those in the 
control group, the expression levels of lncRNA MEG3, Klotho, FGF23, and Bcl-2 
decreased significantly and the expression levels of microRNA-34a (miR-34a), 
Bax, TGF-β1, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8 increased sharply (P<0.05) in the 
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) group. Meanwhile, lncRNA MEG3 overexpression 
upregulated the expression of miR-34a, Bax, TGF-β1, Caspase3 and Caspase8, and 
downregulated the expression of Klotho, FGF23 and Bcl-2.
CONCLUSIONS: lncRNA MEG3 regulated the expression of FGF23, Bcl-2, Bax, TGF-β1, 
Caspase 3, and Caspase 8 by regulating the miR-34a/Klotho axis, thereby 
affecting the progress of OA.

The mandatory closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic affected the 
mental health, and, by extension, the personal and professional life of 
teachers. This study explored their level of resilience during the pandemic and 
its association with attitudes towards emergency remote teaching and perceived 
stress. Data were collected through the administration of three self-report 
instruments: (a) the "Teachers' Professional Attitudes and Behaviors Scale", (b) 
the "Teachers' Resilience Scale", and (c) the "Perceived Stress Scale". The 
sample consisted of 1415 general teachers from central Greece. Teachers were 
found to possess neutral attitudes towards emergency remote teaching, moderate 
levels of resilience, and experienced slightly increased levels of stress. The 
examined constructs were largely influenced by some of the teachers' demographic 
and professional characteristics. Teachers' perceptions of resilience predicted 
their attitudes to emergency remote teaching and stress levels during the 
pandemic. The study has reaffirmed the importance of holding sufficient levels 
of resilience to cope with adverse circumstances and has offered clear 
directions about which groups of teachers are in most need for counselling and 
professional support so that their resilience is strengthened.

With the growing interest in sport-based positive youth development (PYD) 
programs across the African continent, there is a need to establish suitable 
measures to evaluate the success of these programs in fostering PYD. The Life 
Skills Scale for Sport (LSSS) was recently developed as a sport-specific measure 
of life skills development. Despite its good psychometric properties among 
British youth sport participants, cross-cultural evidence indicates differences 
in the conceptualization of the eight factors measured by the LSSS. To determine 
the suitability of the LSSS for use in the African youth sport context, this 
study examined the latent structure and reproducibility of scores produced by 
the scale in a sample of youth sport participants from Botswana and Ghana. 
Cross-sectional data from a sample of 495 youth athletes (male = 51.72%), aged 
12-21 years (M = 16.76, SD = 1.58), from junior and senior secondary schools was 
used in this study. Confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural 
equation modeling were conducted, and conventional fit indices were used to 
assess model fit. Results on the original LSSS model indicated the need for 
model re-specification in the current sample. A re-specified LSSS, consisting of 
the original eight factors, but only 34 of the original 43 items, demonstrated 
improved fit and adequate internal consistency. Scores derived from the 
re-specified LSSS proved to be a valid estimate of life skills development in 
the current sample of youth sport participants. This has important implications 
for the utility of the LSSS in different cultures.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity, defined as having two or more chronic diseases, has 
a major impact on public health and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This 
study aims to assess the prevalence of medication adherence and associated 
factors among patients with multimorbidity.
METHODS: A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted by a 
trained interviewer across patients with multimorbidity attending outpatient 
clinics in two tertiary referral hospitals in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
Demographic and social variables and the outcome (self-reported adherence to 
long-term medication) were measured using the General Medication Adherence Scale 
(GMAS). Multiple logistic regression was used to assess medication adherence and 
associated factors.
RESULTS: From a total of 630 participants included in this study, the estimated 
prevalence of high medication adherence is 78.57% (±1.63478) with a 95% 
confidence interval (CI) [75.19, 81.61]. The odds of high medication adherence 
increased with age. The odds of high medication adherence for patients aged 66 
years and older than those aged 19-35 years is adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 
3.880, with a 95% CI [1.124, 13.390]. Patients with income more than 50,000 had 
the odds, AOR = 5.169 with a 95% CI [1.282, 20.843], compared to those earning 
less than 10,000 Dirhams (AED). Patients aged 36-65 with health insurance 
coverage had higher medication adherence than groups on the other end. The 
number of current medications is significantly (p-value = 0.027) associated with 
high medication adherence with the odds of high medication adherence, AOR = 
4.529 with a 95% CI [1.184, 17.326], the highest for those currently taking four 
medications.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights younger population having multimorbidity in 
the context of an increasing life expectancy and suboptimal therapeutic 
outcomes. Furthermore, the study highlights multimorbidity is associated with 
low medication adherence and out-of-pocket payment, and non-availability of 
insurance is a major hindrance to medication adherence.

Current Trends and Perspectives in the Immune Therapy for Substance Use 
Disorders.

Vasiliu O(1).

Author information:

Military Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.

Substance use disorders (SUDs) are an extremely challenging category of 
disorders because of the high rate of relapse, lower life expectancy, important 
rate of psychiatric and somatic co-morbidity, lack of patients' insight during 
most of the disease duration, healthcare costs, etc. One of the reasons to 
consider these disorders very difficult for physicians and the healthcare system 
is the lack of adequate pharmacological agents with long-term proven efficacy. 
So far, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines 
Agency (EMA)-approved treatments for most of the SUDs, except for alcohol use 
disorder, nicotine use disorder, and opioid use disorder. Immunotherapy has been 
considered a possible solution to SUDs because it may selectively target a 
certain drug of abuse, it may have a long-lasting effect (several weeks or 
months), and it ensures an adequate therapeutic adherence. The objective of this 
paper was to establish the current stage of research in the field of SUDs 
vaccines, based on a brief literature review. Vaccines for cocaine and nicotine 
dependence have reached phase III trials, while other researchers are focusing 
on passive immunization therapy for methamphetamine use disorder. New 
generations of vaccines are currently explored, and they are based on superior 
technologies compared to the first generation of immune therapy (e.g., viral 
transfer genes, more immunogenic adjuvants, or higher specificity haptens). 
Therefore, finding immune therapies for substance use disorders SUDs remains a 
matter of interest, and this approach may be useful for the management of an 
extremely dangerous and versatile psychiatric pathology.

INTRODUCTION: The mortality of burn injury is a serious health problem among 
older people. The present study aimed to determine the epidemiological 
characteristics of burn mortality and Years of Life Lost (YLLs) among people 
aged ≥ 60.
METHODS: The National and Subnational Burden of Disease (NASBOD) study includes 
population-based cross-sectional data from the death registration system of Iran 
and those recorded by the cemeteries of Tehran and Esfahan were used in this 
study. Spatio-temporal and Gaussian process regression models were applied to 
estimate rates and trends of mortality and cause-specific mortality fractions. 
YLLs were calculated using Iranian life expectancy and the number of deaths.
RESULTS: The mortality rate for 1990 and 2015 was 17.4 and 4.5 per 100,000, 
respectively. From 1990 through 2015, the annual percentage of change in burn 
mortality rate was -6.1% in females and -4.4% in males. During 2015, there were 
326 deaths following burns in people aged 60+ with 4586 person YLLs, and in 1990 
there were 523 deaths with 4862 person-YLLs. The male-female ratio for 1990 and 
2015 were 0.80 and 0.88, respectively. The age-standardized mortality rate was 
higher than 8.5 per 100,000 in border provinces in 2015. The provinces with 
better socioeconomic situations, such as Tehran, had a lower mortality rate than 
poor provinces, such as Sistan va Baluchistan.
CONCLUSION: Although burn mortality in old people decreased in those 26 years, 
it is still high compared to high-income countries. Continued efforts to 
increase preventive measures and adequate access to quality care, especially in 
border provinces, is suggested.

Introduction. The ever-expanding indications for total hip arthroplasty are 
leading to more implants being placed in younger as well as in older patients 
with high functional demand. Also, prolonged life expectancy is contributing to 
an overall increment of periprosthetic femoral fractures. The Vancouver 
classification has been the most used for guiding the surgeon choice since its 
proposal in 1995. Fractures occurring over a hip femoral implant can be divided 
into intra-operative and post-operative PFFs, and their treatment depends on 
factors that may severely affect the outcome: level of fracture, implant 
stability, quality of bone stock, patients' functional demand, age and 
comorbidities, and surgeon expertise. There are many different treatment 
techniques available which include osteosynthesis and revision surgery or a 
combination of both. The goals of surgical treatment are patients' early 
mobilization, restoration of anatomical alignment and length with a stable 
prosthesis and maintenance of bone stock. Significance. The aim of this review 
is to describe the state-of-the-art treatment and outcomes in the management of 
PFFs. We performed a systematic literature review of studies reporting on the 
management of PFFs around hip stems and inter-prosthetic fractures identifying 
45 manuscripts eligible for the analysis. Conclusions. PFFs present peculiar 
characteristic that must be considered and special features that must be 
addressed. Their management is complex due to the extreme variability of stem 
designs, the possibility of having cemented or uncemented stems, the difficulty 
in identifying the "real" level of the fracture and the actual stability of the 
stem. As a result, the definition of a standardized treatment is unlikely, 
thereby high expertise is fundamental for the surgical management of PPFs, so
