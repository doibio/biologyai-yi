The mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of free polysaccharides and glycans 
released from proteins, lipids and proteoglycans increasingly relies on 
databases and software. Here, we review progress in the bioinformatics analysis 
of protein-released N- and O-linked glycans (N- and O-glycomics) and propose an 
e-infrastructure to overcome current deficits in data and experimental 
transparency. This workflow enables the standardized submission of MS-based 
glycomics information into the public repository UniCarb-DR. It implements the 
MIRAGE (Minimum Requirement for A Glycomics Experiment) reporting guidelines, 
storage of unprocessed MS data in the GlycoPOST repository and glycan structure 
registration using the GlyTouCan registry, thereby supporting the development 
and extension of a glycan structure knowledgebase.

PURPOSE: Continued smoking after a cancer diagnosis is associated with poor 
treatment outcomes and reduced life expectancy. We aimed to identify the 
stability of smoking status after diagnosis including quit attempts and quit 
intentions.
METHODS: Participants with a first primary cancer diagnosis were recruited via 
two state-based registries in Australia. Questionnaires were mailed at 
approximately 6 months (T1), 1 year (T2), 2 years (T3), and 3.5 years (T4) 
post-diagnosis. Smoking status and quitting intentions were assessed at each 
time point.
RESULTS: A cohort of 1444 people was recruited. People who indicated that they 
were more than 9 months post-diagnosis are excluded from analysis, leaving 1407 
eligible study participants. Sixty-six (37%) of the 178 self-reported smokers at 
diagnosis had quit in the 6-month post-diagnosis (T1), the remaining 112 (63%) 
reported being a current smoker. Of the smokers at T1, 40% intended to quit: 
with 8% having quit smoking by T2; 11% quit by T3; 12% quit by T4. Of those who 
reported at T1 that they intended to quit in the next 6 months, 10% or fewer 
reported having quit at any subsequent time point. Quitting attempts decreased 
in frequency over time post-diagnosis. Less than 15% of respondents who had quit 
at or shortly before diagnosis reported relapse to smoking at each time point.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of smokers diagnosed with cancer continue to smoke 
beyond diagnosis, even in the context of an intention to quit and attempts to do 
so. Cancer survivors who smoke remain motivated to quit well beyond the initial 
diagnosis.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: There are clear positive clinical effects of 
smoking cessation for those who have undergone treatment for cancer, both for 
short-term treatment outcomes, and for long-term survivorship. Given the 
substantial rates of continued smoking among those who report smoking at 
diagnosis and their continued attempts to quit during survivorship, there is a 
need for improved cessation support initiatives for people diagnosed with 
cancer. These initiatives need to continue to be offered to smokers long after 
the initial diagnosis and treatment.

For biomedical applications, proteins may require conjugation to small and large 
molecules. Typical examples are dyes for imaging, cytotoxic effector molecules 
for cell killing, or half-life extension modules for optimized pharmacokinetics. 
Although many conjugation strategies are straightforward to apply, most of them 
do not enable site-specific and orthogonal conjugation, and do not yield a 
defined stoichiometry. Moreover, techniques offering these desirable features 
often rely on complex expression procedures and suffer from low production 
yields. A more promising manufacturing strategy for flexible, site-specific and 
stoichiometrically defined payloading of proteins is the combination of click 
chemistry and thiol-maleimide conjugation, which even enables dual labeling when 
used consecutively. Here, we describe as an example the production of Designed 
Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins), a non-IgG binding scaffold, in a specific E. 
coli strain to obtain high yields of protein carrying both a thiol and an azide 
group. We provide straightforward protocols for strain-promoted azide-alkyne 
cycloaddition (SPAAC) and thiol-maleimide conjugation, and furthermore compare 
these conjugation chemistries with existing alternatives like copper-catalyzed 
azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Finally, detailed instructions for 
reactivity analysis and yield estimations of the reactions are provided.

Policy Points The World Health Organization has recommended sodium reduction as 
a "best buy" to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite this, Congress has 
temporarily blocked the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from implementing 
voluntary industry targets for sodium reduction in processed foods, the 
implementation of which could cost the industry around $16 billion over 10 
years. We modeled the health and economic impact of meeting the two-year and 
ten-year FDA targets, from the perspective of people working in the food system 
itself, over 20 years, from 2017 to 2036. Benefits of implementing the FDA 
voluntary sodium targets extend to food companies and food system workers, and 
the value of CVD-related health gains and cost savings are together greater than 
the government and industry costs of reformulation.
CONTEXT: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set draft voluntary targets 
to reduce sodium levels in processed foods. We aimed to determine cost 
effectiveness of meeting these draft sodium targets, from the perspective of US 
food system workers.
METHODS: We employed a microsimulation cost-effectiveness analysis using the US 
IMPACT Food Policy model with two scenarios: (1) short term, achieving two-year 
FDA reformulation targets only, and (2) long term, achieving 10-year FDA 
reformulation targets. We modeled four close-to-reality populations: food system 
"ever" workers; food system "current" workers in 2017; and subsets of processed 
food "ever" and "current" workers. Outcomes included cardiovascular disease 
cases prevented and postponed as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from 2017 to 2036.
FINDINGS: Among food system ever workers, achieving long-term sodium reduction 
targets could produce 20-year health gains of approximately 180,000 QALYs (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI]: 150,000 to 209,000) and health cost savings of 
approximately $5.2 billion (95% UI: $3.5 billion to $8.3 billion), with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $62,000 (95% UI: $1,000 to 
$171,000) per QALY gained. For the subset of processed food industry workers, 
health gains would be approximately 32,000 QALYs (95% UI: 27,000 to 37,000); 
cost savings, $1.0 billion (95% UI: $0.7bn to $1.6bn); and ICER, $486,000 (95% 
UI: $148,000 to $1,094,000) per QALY gained. Because many health benefits may 
occur in individuals older than 65 or the uninsured, these health savings would 
be shared among individuals, industry, and government.
CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of implementing the FDA voluntary sodium targets 
extend to food companies and food system workers, with the value of health gains 
and health care cost savings outweighing the costs of reformulation, although 
not for the processed food industry.

The concentrations of metals in the environment are still not within the 
recommended limits as set by the regulatory authorities in various countries 
because of human activities. They can enter the food chain and bioaccumulate in 
soft and hard tissues/organs, often with a long half-life of the metal in the 
body. Metal exposure has a negative impact on bone health and may result in 
osteoporosis and increased fracture risk depending on concentration and duration 
of metal exposure and metal species. Bones are a long-term repository for lead 
and some other metals, and may approximately contain 90% of the total body 
burden in birds and mammals. The present review focuses on the most common 
metals found in contaminated areas (mercury, cadmium, lead, nickel, chromium, 
iron, and aluminum) and their effects on bone tissue, considering the 
possibility of the long-term bone accumulation, and also some differences that 
might exist between different age groups in the whole population.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Periprosthetic distal femoral fractures (PDFF) constitute 
an unpleasant complication in patients with a total knee replacement (TKR). The 
incidence reported in literature is 0.3-2.5 %. The number of periprosthetic knee 
fractures has been increasing due to the ageing of population, a growing number 
of implants, a longer life expectancy of patients, a more intensive physical 
activity of patients, and osteoporosis. Most of these fractures are treated 
surgically, non-surgical treatment is reserved solely for patients unable to 
undergo a surgery for general health conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS Our 
retrospective study evaluated the group of patients with PDFF who were treated 
at out department in the period 2007- 2016 and 2,975 primary TKR were performed. 
The total number of patients with PDFF was 56. The mean age of patients with 
PDFF was 77 years (56-94 years) and at the time of fracture the mean age was 71 
years in men and 78 years in women. The average time from the TKR to 
periprosthetic fracture was 8.2 years (0-20 years). The fractures were assessed 
using the Su classification modified by Krbec. RESULTS A primary TKR was 
performed in 46 cases for gonarthrosis, in 6 cases for rheumatoid arthritis and 
in 4 cases for secondary, post-traumatic gonarthrosis. The average incidence of 
periprosthetic distal femoral fractures was 5-6 cases per year. Women 
represented 86 %, men 14 %. Su Type I fracture was diagnosed in 25 % of cases, 
Su Type II fractures in 71 %, and Su Type III fractures 4 %. 52 patients with 
PDFF were treated surgically, in 4 cases conservative treatment was opted for. 
The average treatment time of PDFF to healing by callus formation was 6.6 months 
(3-12 months). Mortality during the first 3 months after osteosynthesis of PDFF 
was 9 %. A failure of osteosynthesis of PDFF was reported in 4 cases. DISCUSSION 
Multiple classification systems were developed to assess these fractures. The 
most appropriate we consider the classification of Su et al. classifying the 
PDFF into 3 groups, namely based on the height of the fracture line relative to 
the femoral component. Osteosynthesis by retrograde femoral nail is indicated 
for periprosthetic fractures, with sufficient bone mass in distal femur, which 
allows stable distal fixation. The new generation of anatomically shaped angular 
stable implants gives us yet another option for osteosynthesis of PDFF. Many 
studies point at the advantages of these implants in osteoporotic bone as 
against the conventional plates. CONCLUSIONS The number of PDFF has been 
increasing. The main methods of internal osteosynthesis continue to be the 
angular stable plates and the retrograde femoral nail. Preoperative planning is 
important to determine the type and dimensions of the existing femoral component 
and to distinguish whether or not it has come loose. The choice of the implant 
may depend on the bone mass available for distal fixation. The retrograde 
femoral nail is usually the most suitable method of treatment for proximal PDFF 
(Su Type I). The angular stable plates can be used for PDFF originating at the 
femoral component (Su Type II and Type III). Very distal fractures classified as 
Su Type III with a loose femoral component require a revision surgery with a TKR 
with stems. The surgeon should be prepared for a revision surgery if the 
intraoperative finding is more complicated than anticipated based on the 
preoperative radiograph. Key words:total knee arthroplasty, periprosthetic 
fracture, osteosynthesis.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized 
by progressive muscle weakness and myotonia along with multiple organ system 
involvements. Overall, DM1 patients show reduced life expectancy, mainly due to 
respiratory or cardiac abnormalities. Chronic respiratory impairment is 
associated with increased morbidity in DM1. The main ventilatory dysfunction 
etiology in DM1 is complex, consisting of both peripheral respiratory 
dysfunction and central respiratory drive dysfunction as well as upper airway 
muscle dysfunction leading to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) and 
aspiration. Advancements in early diagnosis of DM1 and management with 
non-invasive therapeutic tools have improved life expectancy for DM1 patients. 
We present herein two siblings with DM1, a thin elder brother and an obese 
younger sister with visceral fat accumulation. Although neither had voluntary 
symptoms related to respiratory dysfunction, their apnea-hypopnea indices 
revealed severe SAS and subsequent arterial blood gases studies showed 
hypercapnia as well as hypoxia, suggesting central nervous system involvement 
with peripheral respiratory dysfunction. Non-invasive positive pressure 
ventilation during sleep was started following pulmonary assessment. Respiratory 
function should be assessed in DM1 patients, even those free of respiratory 
symptoms, because respiratory muscle weakness occurs in a high percentage of 
these patients and will shorten their lives.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is currently a disease in which patients can 
enjoy a near normal life-expectancy. However, since the majority of patients 
will need to remain on treatment indefinitely, physicians in care of CML 
patients need be familiar with the indications and toxicities of all approved 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). In clinical practice, there are five TKI 
(imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib) that are available in 
different scenarios and have distinct safety profiles. Decisions regarding first 
line treatment must be based on CML risk, comorbidities, and patients 
expectations. Despite the excellent outcome, half of the patients will 
eventually fail (due to intolerance or resistance) to first line treatment, with 
many of them requiring a third or even further lines of therapy. When selecting 
for such patients, it is essential to distinguish between failure and 
intolerance to previous TKIs. In the present review, we will address all these 
issues from a practical point of view.

BACKGROUND: The NEVEREST-3 (South Africa) and MONOD-ANRS-12206 (Côte d'Ivoire, 
Burkina Faso) randomized trials found that switching to efavirenz (EFV) in human 
immunodeficiency virus-infected children >3 years old who were virologically 
suppressed by ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) was noninferior to continuing 
o LPV/r. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of this strategy using the 
Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-Pediatric model.
METHODS: We examined 3 strategies in South African children aged ≥3 years who 
were virologically suppressed by LPV/r: (1) continued LPV/r, even in case of 
virologic failure, without second-line regimens; continued on LPV/r with 
second-line option after observed virologic failure; and preemptive switch to 
EFV-based antiretroviral therapy (ART), with return to LPV/r after observed 
virologic failure. We derived data on 24-week suppression (<1000 copies/mL) 
after a switch to EFV (98.4%) and the subsequent risk of virologic failure 
(LPV/r, 0.23%/mo; EFV, 0.15%/mo) from NEVEREST-3 data; we obtained ART costs 
(LPV/r, $6-$20/mo; EFV, $3-$6/mo) from published sources. We projected 
discounted life expectancy (LE) and lifetime costs per person. A secondary 
analysis used data from MONOD-ANRS-12206 in Côte d'Ivoire.
RESULTS: Continued LPV/r led to the shortest LE (18.2 years) and the highest 
per-person lifetime cost ($19 470). LPV/r with second-line option increased LE 
(19.9 years) and decreased per-person lifetime costs($16 070). Switching led to 
the longest LE (20.4 years) and the lowest per-person lifetime cost ($15 240); 
this strategy was cost saving under plausible variations in key parameters. 
Using MONOD-ANRS-12206 data in Côte d'Ivoire, the Switch strategy remained cost 
saving only compared with continued LPV/r, but the LPV/r with second-line option 
strategy was cost-effective compared with switching.
CONCLUSION: For children ≥3 years old and virologically suppressed by 
LPV/r-based ART, preemptive switching to EFV can improve long-term clinical 
outcomes and be cost saving.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a key redox compound in all living 
cells responsible for energy transduction, genomic integrity, life-span 
extension, and neuromodulation. Here, we report a new function of NAD+ as a 
molecular photocatalyst in addition to the biological roles. Our spectroscopic 
and electrochemical analyses reveal light absorption and electronic properties 
of two π-conjugated systems of NAD+. Furthermore, NAD+ exhibits a robust 
photostability under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation. We demonstrate photocatalytic redox 
reactions driven by NAD+, such as O2 reduction, H2O oxidation, and the formation 
of metallic nanoparticles. Beyond the traditional role of NAD+ as a cofactor in 
redox biocatalysis, NAD+ executes direct photoactivation of oxidoreductases 
through the reduction of enzyme prosthetic groups. Consequently, the synergetic 
integration of biocatalysis and photocatalysis using NAD+ enables 
solar-to-chemical conversion with the highest-ever-recorded turnover frequency 
and total turnover number of 1263.4 hour-1 and 1692.3, respectively, for 
light-driven biocatalytic trans-hydrogenation.

Solid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasms (SPEN), also known Frantz tumors, are 
rare pancreatic exocrine neoplasms with age and gender predisposition. This 
pathology was first described by Dr. Virginia Kneeland Frantz in 1959 and hence 
the name. Other names include solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas, 
solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN), papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, 
Hamoudi tumor, or Gruber-Frantz tumor. These are low grade with low malignant 
potential neoplasms commonly seen in young and adolescent females and rarely 
affects men . Accurate diagnosis of SPEN is of utmost importance since it has a 
low malignant potential, and with prompt diagnosis and surgery, the patients 
could have a long life expectancy including possible cure.

Psychrotolerant growth of Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat (RTE) foods 
increases the risk to food safety, particularly when spoilage does not occur 
prior to L. monocytogenes growth of >1 log CFU/g. The purpose of this study was 
to evaluate the relative rates of quality deterioration and L. monocytogenes 
growth in six product systems (tomatoes, apples, fresh-cut cantaloupe, fresh-cut 
lettuce, baby spinach, and commercially processed turkey slices) under various 
conditions of refrigeration temperatures, atmospheres, and quality. Cantaloupe 
and spinach leaves supported >1 log CFU/g growth of L. monocytogenes before 
product spoilage at both 4 and 9°C. In some cases, conditions that improved 
microbial quality by extending shelf life also allowed L. monocytogenes growth 
of >1 log CFU/g before deterioration due to microbial spoilage. For example, 
storage with modified atmosphere packaging enhanced L. monocytogenes growth 
relative to spoilage microbiota in lettuce leaves (1.0-log increase 7 days 
before spoilage). In contrast, the use of secondary quality produce (i.e., 
apples, tomatoes, and lettuce with physical damage) reduced shelf life and, 
consequently, limited the time for L. monocytogenes proliferation. Therefore, 
spoilage cannot be considered a fail-safe indicator or proxy for limitation of 
shelf life across refrigerated RTE products.

PURPOSE: There is limited access to quality palliative care (PC) for patients 
with advanced cancer in sub-Saharan Africa. Our aim was to describe the 
development of the Project Extension for Community Healthcare 
Outcomes-Palliative Care in Africa (ECHO-PACA) program and describe a 
preliminary evaluation of attitudes and knowledge of participants regarding the 
ability of the program to deliver quality PC.
METHODS: An interdisciplinary team at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, guided by 
experts in PC in sub-Saharan Africa, adapted a standardized curriculum based on 
PC needs in the region. Participants were then recruited, and monthly 
telementoring sessions were held for 16 months. The monthly telementoring 
sessions consisted of case presentations, discussions, and didactic lectures. 
Program participants came from 14 clinics and teaching hospitals in Ghana, 
Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zambia. Participants were surveyed at the 
beginning, midpoint, and end of the 16-month program to evaluate changes in 
attitudes and knowledge of PC.
RESULTS: The median number of participants per session was 30. Thirty-three 
(83%) of 40 initial participants completed the feedback survey. Health care 
providers' self-reported confidence in providing PC increased with participation 
in the Project ECHO-PACA clinic. There was significant improvement in the 
participants' attitudes and knowledge, especially in titrating opioids for pain 
control (P = .042), appropriate use of non-opioid analgesics (P = .012), and 
identifying and addressing communication issues related to end-of-life care (P = 
.014).
CONCLUSION: Project ECHO-PACA was a successful approach for disseminating 
knowledge about PC. The participants were adherent to ECHO PACA clinics and the 
completion of feedback surveys. Future studies should evaluate the impact of 
Project ECHO-PACA on changes in provider practice as well as patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Exposure to fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) is hazardous 
to health. Our aim was to directly estimate the health and longevity impacts of 
current PM2.5 concentrations and the benefits of reductions from 1999 to 2015, 
nationally and at county level, for the entire contemporary population of the 
contiguous United States.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used vital registration and population data with 
information on sex, age, cause of death, and county of residence. We used four 
Bayesian spatiotemporal models, with different adjustments for other 
determinants of mortality, to directly estimate mortality and life expectancy 
loss due to current PM2.5 pollution and the benefits of reductions since 1999, 
nationally and by county. The covariates included in the adjusted models were 
per capita income; percentage of population whose family income is below the 
poverty threshold, who are of Black or African American race, who have graduated 
from high school, who live in urban areas, and who are unemployed; cumulative 
smoking; and mean temperature and relative humidity. In the main model, which 
adjusted for these covariates and for unobserved county characteristics through 
the use of county-specific random intercepts, PM2.5 pollution in excess of the 
lowest observed concentration (2.8 μg/m3) was responsible for an estimated 
15,612 deaths (95% credible interval 13,248-17,945) in females and 14,757 deaths 
(12,617-16,919) in males. These deaths would lower national life expectancy by 
an estimated 0.15 years (0.13-0.17) for women and 0.13 years (0.11-0.15) for 
men. The life expectancy loss due to PM2.5 was largest around Los Angeles and in 
some southern states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Alabama. At any PM2.5 
concentration, life expectancy loss was, on average, larger in counties with 
lower income and higher poverty rate than in wealthier counties. Reductions in 
PM2.5 since 1999 have lowered mortality in all but 14 counties where PM2.5 
increased slightly. The main limitation of our study, similar to other 
observational studies, is that it is not guaranteed for the observed 
associations to be causal. We did not have annual county-level data on other 
important determinants of mortality, such as healthcare access and quality and 
diet, but these factors were adjusted for with use of county-specific random 
intercepts.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our estimates, recent reductions in particulate matter 
pollution in the USA have resulted in public health benefits. Nonetheless, we 
estimate that current concentrations are associated with mortality impacts and 
loss of life expectancy, with larger impacts in counties with lower income and 
higher poverty rate.

BACKGROUND: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. 
The prevalence of CKD is rising especially in elderly, as consequence of 
population-ageing related to socioeconomic development and better life 
expectancy. There are scarce studies evaluating CKD progression and its 
associated factors in elderly patients.
METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study including 340 patients (≥ 
65 years old) CKD stages 3a-5 non-dialysis, incidents in an outpatient CKD 
clinic, followed by 2.1 years. CKD progression was assessed by the slope of eGFR 
calculated by CKD-EPI and BIS 1 equations. The patients were divided in 
progressor and non-progressor groups (eGFR slope < or ≥ 0 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, 
respectively).
RESULTS: Kidney function declined in 193 (57%) patients. In this group, the 
progression rate was -2.83 (-5.1 / -1.1) mL /min /1.73 m2 /year. Compared to non 
progressor, the progressor patients were younger [72 (69-78) vs. 76 (69-80) 
years; p = 0.02]; had higher proportion of diabetic nephropathy, higher serum 
phosphorus [3.8 (3.3-4.1) vs. 3.5 (3.9-4.1) mg/dL; p = 0.04] and proteinuria 
[0.10 (0-0.9 vs. 0 (0-0.3)] g/L; p = 0.007)] at the admission. In the logistic 
regression analysis adjusted for gender and eGFR, proteinuria was independently 
associated with CKD progression [OR (Odds Ratio) (1.83; 95% CI, 1.17-2.86; p < 
0.01)].
CONCLUSION: CKD progression was observed in the majority of elderly CKD patients 
and proteinuria was the most important factor associated to the decline of 
kidney function in this population.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health is a promising strategy aiming to anticipate and 
prevent the deterioration of health status in palliative cancer patients. A 
prerequisite for successful implementation of this technology into clinical 
routine is a high level of usability and acceptance of devices.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate feasibility as well as patients' acceptance of 
remote monitoring using wearables in palliative cancer patients.
METHODS: In this prospective single-center observational feasibility study, 30 
cancer patients treated with palliative intent in an inpatient setting with an 
estimated life expectancy of >8 weeks and <12 months were provided with a 
smartphone including a pre-installed "Activity Monitoring" app and a 
sensor-equipped bracelet and monitored over a period of 12 weeks starting at 
discharge from hospital. We report detailed feasibility and usability aspects 
and comment on patients' acceptance of the wearables.
RESULTS: Between February 2017 and May 2018 a total of 30 patients were included 
in the study. From these, 25 participants (83%) completed the whole study 
period. On average, the bracelet was worn on 53% and smartphone used on 85% of 
the study days. The completion rate of daily digital questionnaires for 
subjective ratings (pain and distress scale) was 73%, and 28 patients were able 
to handle the wearables and to operate the app without major problems. Use of 
the bracelet was low during the night hours, with a wearing time of 1.7% of all 
night hours (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.).
CONCLUSIONS: Remote monitoring of health care status in palliative cancer 
patients with a limited life expectancy is feasible and patients are able to 
handle the smartphone and the sensor-equipped bracelet. Feedback towards use of 
this monitoring system was mostly positive.

BACKGROUND: Wolfram syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder, is considered the 
best prototype of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) diseases. Classical WS features are 
childhood-onset diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness, diabetes insipidus, 
neurological signs, and other abnormalities. Two causative genes (WFS1 and WFS2) 
have been identified. The transmission of the disease takes place in an 
autosomal recessive mode but autosomal dominant mutations responsible for 
WS-related disorders have been described. Prognosis is poor, death occurs at the 
median age of 39 years with a major cause represented by respiratory failure as 
a consequence of brain stem atrophy and neurodegeneration. The aim of this 
narrative review is to focus on etiology, pathogenesis and natural history of WS 
for an adequate patient management and for the discussion of future therapeutic 
interventions.
MAIN BODY: WS requires a multidisciplinary approach in order to be successfully 
treated. A prompt diagnosis decreases morbidity and mortality through prevention 
and treatment of complications. Being a monogenic pathology, WS represents a 
perfect model to study the mechanisms of ER stress and how this condition leads 
to cell death, in comparison with other prevalent diseases in which multiple 
factors interact to produce the disease manifestations. WS is also an important 
disease prototype to identify drugs and molecules associated with ER 
homeostasis. Evidence indicates that specific metabolic diseases (type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes), neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, inflammatory 
pathologies and also cancer are closely related to ER dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic strategies in WS are based on drug repurposing (i.e., 
investigation of approved drugs for novel therapeutic indications) with the aim 
to stop the progression of the disease by reducing the endoplasmic reticulum 
stress. An extensive understanding of WS from pathophysiology to therapy is 
fundamental and more studies are necessary to better manage this devastating 
disease and guarantee the patients a better quality of life and longer life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Traditional decision rules have limitations when a new technology is 
less effective and less costly than a comparator. We propose a new probabilistic 
decision framework to examine non-inferiority in effectiveness and net monetary 
benefit (NMB) simultaneously. We illustrate this framework using the example of 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and electroconvulsive 
therapy (ECT) for treatment-resistant depression.
METHODS: We modeled the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with the 
new intervention (rTMS), an active control (ECT), and a placebo control, and we 
estimated the fraction of effectiveness preserved by the new intervention 
through probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). We then assessed the 
probability of cost-effectiveness using a traditional cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curve (CEAC) and our new decision-making framework. In our new 
framework, we considered the new intervention cost-effective in each simulation 
of the PSA if it preserved at least 75 percent of the effectiveness of the 
active control (thus demonstrating non-inferiority) and had a positive NMB at a 
given willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP).
RESULTS: rTMS was less effective (i.e., associated with fewer QALYs) and less 
costly than ECT. The traditional CEAC approach showed that the probabilities of 
rTMS being cost-effective were 100 percent, 39 percent, and 14 percent at WTPs 
of $0, $50,000, and $100,000 per QALY gained, respectively. In the new decision 
framework, the probabilities of rTMS being cost-effective were reduced to 23 
percent, 21 percent, and 13 percent at WTPs of $0, $50,000, and $100,000 per 
QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This new framework provides a different perspective for decision 
making with considerations of both non-inferiority and WTP thresholds.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the societal cost-effectiveness of the Transmural Trauma 
Care Model (TTCM), a multidisciplinary transmural rehabilitation model for 
trauma patients, compared with regular care.
METHODS: The economic evaluation was performed alongside a before-and-after 
study, with a convenience control group measured only afterward, and a 9-month 
follow-up. Control group patients received regular care and were measured before 
implementation of the TTCM. Intervention group patients received the TTCM and 
were measured after its implementation. The primary outcome was generic 
health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Secondary outcomes included 
disease-specific HR-QOL, pain, functional status, and perceived recovery.
RESULTS: Eighty-three trauma patients were included in the intervention group 
and fifty-seven in the control group. Total societal costs were lower in the 
intervention group than in the control group, but not statistically 
significantly so (EUR-267; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], EUR-4,175-3011). 
At 9 months, there was no statistically significant between-group differences in 
generic HR-QOL (0.05;95 percent CI, -0.02-0.12) and perceived recovery (0.09;95 
percent CI, -0.09-0.28). However, mean between-group differences were 
statistically significantly in favor of the intervention group for 
disease-specific HR-QOL (-8.2;95 percent CI, -15.0--1.4), pain (-0.84;95CI, 
-1.42--0.26), and functional status (-20.1;95 percent CI, -29.6--10.7). 
Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that if decision makers are 
not willing to pay anything per unit of effect gained, the TTCM has a 0.54-0.58 
probability of being cost-effective compared with regular care. For all 
outcomes, this probability increased with increasing values of 
willingness-to-pay.
CONCLUSIONS: The TTCM may be cost-effective compared with regular care, 
depending on the decision-makers willingness to pay and the probability of 
cost-effectiveness that they perceive as acceptable.

A fraction of sperm deposited at mating or insemination reaches the oviduct 
isthmus, where sperm are retained and thereby form a reservoir. This reservoir 
delays capacitation, prevents polyspermy, selects a fertile population of sperm, 
and, foremost, increases sperm lifespan. The molecular interactions underlying 
the formation of a sperm reservoir are becoming clearer in mammals. Sperm 
lectins bind to oviductal glycans to form the reservoir. Herein, we found that 
the highest percentage of bovine sperm bound to the 3'-O-sulfated form of Lewis 
A (suLeA) trisaccharide and sialylated Lewis A and that fluoresceinated versions 
of each localized to receptors on the anterior head of the sperm. Following 
capacitation, binding to suLeA decreased significantly, a potential explanation 
for sperm release from the reservoir. MS and immunohistochemistry analyses 
indicated that suLeA motifs were present predominantly on O-linked glycans 
initiated by GalNAc residues, but no sialylated Lewis A was detected. To 
determine whether sperm binding to isolated suLeAin vitro could mimic in vivo 
sperm binding to oviduct cells and increase sperm longevity, we immobilized 
suLeA and incubated it with sperm. Using free-swimming sperm and sperm bound to 
immobilized laminin as controls, we observed that over 96 h, the viability of
