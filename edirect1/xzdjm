relatives can share certain endophenotypes with subjects with SZ. We aim to 
characterize accelerated aging as a possible endophenotype of schizophrenia by 
using a machine learning (ML) model of peripheral biomarkers to accurately 
differentiate subjects with SZ (n = 35), their unaffected siblings (SB, n = 36) 
and healthy controls (HC, n = 47). We used a random forest algorithm that 
included biomarkers related to aging: eotaxins CCL-11 and CCL-24; the oxidative 
stress markers thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyl 
content (PCC), glutathione peroxidase (GPx); and telomere length (TL). The ML 
algorithm of biomarkers was able to distinguish individuals with SZ from HC with 
prediction accuracy of 79.7%, SZ from SB with 62.5% accuracy and SB from HC with 
75.5% accuracy. These results support the hypothesis that a pathological 
accelerated aging might occur in SZ, and this pathological aging could be an 
endophenotype of the disease, once this profile was also observed in SB, 
suggesting that SB might suffer from an accelerated aging in some level.

OBJECTIVE: Although 50 % reduction in seizure frequency is a common efficacy 
endpoint in clinical trials of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), 75 % or greater 
reductions may be required to improve patients' health-related quality of life. 
Identification of clinical factors that are associated with high responder rates 
may help to inform clinicians on which patients may optimally benefit from 
treatment. We evaluated potential predictive factors for achieving major 
treatment responses (≥75 % reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days from study 
baseline) in patients with drug-resistant focal-onset seizures, with/without 
focal to bilateral tonic-clonic (FBTC) seizures in perampanel trials designed 
for regulatory approval.
METHODS: Univariate analyses using logistic regression were performed using data 
from three double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III studies of adjunctive 
perampanel (Studies 304 [NCT00699972], 305 [NCT00699582], 306 [NCT00700310]), 
and their open-label extension study (OLEx; Study 307 [NCT00735397]). For the 
double-blind studies, baseline seizure frequency, number of baseline AEDs, 
baseline seizure type, baseline concomitant enzyme-inducing AEDs (EIAEDs), 
baseline carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or valproic acid, age at diagnosis, time 
since diagnosis, etiology, and perampanel plasma concentration were included 
individually with study treatment. The same factors were included for the OLEx 
analysis except for plasma concentration and treatment. Variables found to be 
significant predictors for a major treatment response in univariate analyses 
were subsequently included in multivariable analyses using backwards and 
forwards selection.
RESULTS: In the double-blind studies, 175/1374 patients had a major response to 
placebo (n = 25) or perampanel (n = 150). The best predictors of a major 
treatment response in multivariable models with forwards and backwards selection 
were: the presence of FBTC seizures during baseline (P = 0.0002), higher 
perampanel plasma concentration (P < 0.0001), older age at diagnosis (P = 0.0024 
and 0.0045, respectively), and lower baseline seizure frequency (P = 0.0364 and 
0.0127, respectively). In the OLEx, 217/1090 patients had a major treatment 
response. The best predictors of a major treatment response in the final 
multivariable model, regardless of backwards or forwards selection, were a lower 
baseline seizure frequency (P = 0.0022), the absence of focal impaired awareness 
seizures during baseline (P = 0.0011), the presence of FBTC seizures during 
baseline (P = 0.0164), lower number(s) of baseline AEDs (P = 0.0002), the 
absence of EIAEDs during baseline (P = 0.0059), an older age at diagnosis (P = 
0.0054), and absence of structural etiologies (P = 0.0138).
SIGNIFICANCE: These analyses of placebo-controlled and long-term extension trial 
data identified a number of potential predictive factors for patients with 
focal-onset seizures achieving a major treatment response. These factors may 
help guide clinicians when predicting a patient's response to treatment and 
optimizing individual treatment regimens.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence shows the effects of psychotropic drugs on the 
evolution of dementia. Until now, only a few studies have evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of psychotropic drugs in institutionalized dementia patients. 
This study aims to assess the cost-utility of intervention performed in the 
metropolitan area of Barcelona (Spain) (MN) based on consensus between 
specialized caregivers involved in the management of dementia patients for 
optimizing and potentially reducing the prescription of inappropriate 
psychotropic drugs in this population. This analysis was conducted using the 
Monitoring and Assessment Framework for the European Innovation Partnership on 
Active and Healthy Ageing (MAFEIP) tool.
METHODS: The MAFEIP tool builds up from a variety of surrogate endpoints 
commonly used across different studies in order to estimate health and economic 
outcomes in terms of incremental changes in quality adjusted life years (QALYs), 
as well as health and social care utilization. Cost estimates are based on 
scientific literature and expert opinion; they are direct costs and include 
medical visits, hospital care, medical tests and exams and drugs administered, 
among other concepts. The healthcare costs of patients using the intervention 
were calculated by means of a medication review that compared patients' 
drug-related costs before, during and after the use of the intervention 
conducted in MN between 2012 and 2014. The cost-utility analysis was performed 
from the perspective of a health care system with a time horizon of 12 months.
RESULTS: The tool calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
the intervention, revealing it to be dominant, or rather, better (more 
effective) and cheaper than the current (standard) care. The ICER of the 
intervention was in the lower right quadrant, making it an intervention that is 
always accepted even with the lowest given Willingness to Pay (WTP) threshold 
value (€15,000).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that the intervention was dominant, 
or rather, better (more effective) and cheaper than the current (standard) care. 
This dominant intervention is therefore recommended to interested investors for 
systematic application.

This clinical guideline from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy 
(ASGE) provides an evidence-based approach for the management of patients with 
malignant hilar obstruction (MHO). This document was developed using the Grading 
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and 
addresses primary drainage modality (percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage 
[PTBD] vs endoscopic biliary drainage [EBD]), drainage strategy (unilateral vs 
bilateral), and stent selection (plastic stent [PS] vs self-expandable metal 
stent [SEMS]). Regarding drainage modality, in patients with MHO undergoing 
drainage before potential resection or transplantation, the panel suggests 
against routine use of PTBD as first-line therapy compared with EBD. In patients 
with unresectable MHO undergoing palliative drainage, the panel suggests PTBD or 
EBD. The final decision should be based on patient preferences, disease 
characteristics, and local expertise. Regarding drainage strategy, in patients 
with unresectable MHO undergoing palliative stent placement, the panel suggests 
placement of bilateral stents compared with a unilateral stent in the absence of 
liver atrophy. Finally, regarding type of stent, in patients with unresectable 
MHO undergoing palliative stent placement, the panel suggests placing SEMSs or 
PSs. However, in patients who have a short life expectancy and who place high 
value on avoiding repeated interventions, the panel suggests using SEMSs 
compared with PSs. If optimal drainage strategy has not been established, the 
panel suggests placing PSs. This document clearly outlines the process, 
analyses, and decision processes used to reach the final recommendations and 
represents the official ASGE recommendations on the above topics.

BACKGROUND: Lanadelumab has been available in Germany for the prophylactic 
treatment of hereditary angioedema since February 2019.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate real-life treatment outcome of lanadelumab and gain 
practical experience in adapting the therapy to individual patients.
METHODS: The study included 34 patients. In 24 patients with hereditary 
angioedema and 4 patients with angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor 
deficiency, the previous treatment was switched to lanadelumab. In 6 patients 
with hereditary angioedema, lanadelumab from the open-label Hereditary 
Angioedema Long-term Prophylaxis study was continued in regular care. During the 
transition, patients were monitored using the angioedema control test and the 
angioedema quality of life questionnaire. At the time at which patients became 
symptom-free, the dosage interval was increased gradually (+3 days).
RESULTS: On average, the angioedema control test values improved from 7.5 
(poorly controlled disease) to 14.9 (well-controlled disease), and all patients 
showed adequate disease control. All treated patients, except 1 outlier, scored 
angioedema quality of life questionnaire values representing only a slight 
reduction in quality of life (mean, 14 points). At the time point of data 
collection, 9 patients used an average fixed injection interval of 30 days. 
Twenty-two patients were symptom-free from the beginning of the treatment phase 
and intended to extend their injection interval from 30 to 32.5 days (median). 
We recommended reducing the initial dosing interval from 24 to 21 days (median) 
to 3 patients because of intermediately occurring symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Gradual extension of injection intervals of lanadelumab presented 
in this study can minimize the burden of therapy without losing efficacy.

Clarifying the Trade-Offs of Risk-Stratified Screening for Prostate Cancer: A 
Cost-Effectiveness Study.

Hendrix N, Gulati R, Jiao B, Kader AK, Ryan ST, Etzioni R.

Cancer risk prediction is necessary for precision early detection, which matches 
screening intensity to risk. However, practical steps for translating risk 
predictions to risk-stratified screening policies are not well established. We 
used a validated population prostate-cancer model to simulate the outcomes of 
strategies that increase intensity for men at high risk and reduce intensity for 
men at low risk. We defined risk by the Prompt Prostate Genetic Score (PGS) 
(Stratify Genomics, San Diego, California), a germline genetic test. We first 
recalibrated the model to reflect the disease incidence observed within risk 
strata using data from a large prevention trial where some participants were 
tested with Prompt PGS. We then simulated risk-stratified strategies in a 
population with the same risk distribution as the trial and evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified screening versus universal (risk-agnostic) 
screening. Prompt PGS risk-adapted screening was more cost-effective when 
universal screening was conservative. Risk-stratified strategies improved 
outcomes at a cost of less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year compared 
with biennial screening starting at age 55 years, but risk stratification was 
not cost-effective compared with biennial screening starting at age 45. 
Heterogeneity of risk and fraction of the population within each stratum were 
also important determinants of cost-effectiveness.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic, metabolic condition characterized by 
excessive blood glucose that causes perturbations in physiological functioning 
of almost all the organs of human body. This devastating metabolic disease has 
its implications in cognitive decline, heart damage, renal, retinal and neuronal 
complications that severely affects quality of life and associated with 
decreased life expectancy. Mitochondria possess adaptive mechanisms to meet the 
cellular energy demand and combat cellular stress. In recent years mitochondrial 
homeostasis has been point of focus where several mechanisms regulating 
mitochondrial health and function are evaluated. Mitochondrial dynamics plays 
crucial role in maintaining healthy mitochondria in cell under physiological as 
well as stress condition. Mitochondrial dynamics and corresponding regulating 
mechanisms have been implicated in progression of metabolic disorders including 
diabetes and its complications. In current review we have discussed about role 
of mitochondrial dynamics under physiological and pathological conditions. Also, 
modulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion in diabetic complications are 
described. The available literature supports mitochondrial remodelling as 
reliable target for diabetic complications.

BACKGROUND: End-of-life care is a driver of increasing healthcare costs; 
however, palliative care interventions may significantly reduce these costs. 
Economic evaluations that measure the incremental cost per quality adjusted life 
years (QALY) are warranted to inform cost-effectiveness of the intervention 
relative to a comparator and permit evaluation of investment against other 
therapeutic interventions. Evidence from the literature up to 2011 indicates a 
scarcity of cost-utility studies in palliative care research.
AIM: This literature review evaluates economic studies published between 2011 
and 2019 to determine whether the methods of economic evaluations have evolved 
since 2011.
DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: A literature search was completed using CENTRAL, OVID 
MEDLINE, EMBASE and other sources for publications between 2011 and 2019. Study 
characteristics, methodology and key findings of publications that met the 
inclusion criteria were reviewed. Quality of studies were assessed using 
indicators developed by authors of the previous literature review.
RESULTS: 46 papers were included for qualitative synthesis. Among them only 6 
studies conducted formal cost-effectiveness evaluations-of these 5 measured 
QALYs and 1 employed probabilistic analyses. In addition, with the exception of 
1 costing analysis, all other economic evaluations undertook a healthcare payer 
perspective. Quality of evidence were comparable to the previous literature 
review published in 2011.
CONCLUSION: Despite the small increase in the number of cost-utility studies, 
the methods of palliative care economic evaluations have not evolved 
significantly since 2011. More probabilistic cost-utility analyses of palliative 
care interventions from a societal perspective are necessary to truly evaluate 
the value for money.

OBJECTIVES: We assessed the prevalence of severe cardiovascular (CV) disease 
requiring hospitalization among patients with schizophrenia in France.
METHOD: We included patients hospitalized with schizophrenia or psychotic 
disorder during 2015, in five French psychiatric hospitals. Patients with CV 
disease were defined as those with a correspondent ICD-10 code during a hospital 
stay in any general hospital, five years before or three years after the 
psychiatric hospitalization. CV disease included myocardial infarction (MI), 
stroke, heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery 
disease. Risk factors such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes were recorded.
RESULTS: In total, 4424 patients with schizophrenia were included. Overall, 203 
(4,6%) patients were diagnosed with CV disease, 93 (2.1%) with CAD, 86 (1.9%) 
with HF and 49 (1.1%) with stroke. The prevalence of hypertension, obesity and 
diabetes was 11.3%, 9.7% and 7.8%. The median (interquartile range) age of 
patients with MI and diabetes was 57 (49-70) and 56 (48-66) years.
CONCLUSION: Patients with schizophrenia develop severe CV disease requiring 
hospitalization at an early age. These severe events are associated with a high 
prevalence of risk factors. Early screening and treatment of CV disease and risk 
factors is important to improve life expectancy and quality of life of these 
patients.

The present study describes the effects of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) 
on shelf-life extension, chemical, microbiological, and sensory properties of 
Domiati cheese. Five different MAP were studied [10% CO2/90% N2 (G1), 15% 
CO2/85% N2 (G2), 25% CO2/75% N2 (G3), 100% CO2 (G4), and 100% N2 (G5)]. Control 
samples were packaged in air (CA) and under vacuum. In both groups of cheeses, 
chemical analysis was significantly affected by MAP during cold storage. 
Ripening indexes were significantly affected by MAP during cold storage. 
Microbiological data showed that G4, followed by G5, were the most effective 
groups inhibiting the growth of total aerobic mesophilic and psychrotrophic 
bacteria, and yeasts and molds until the end of storage. Sensory evaluation was 
significantly affected by MAP and storage period, at 45 d CA cheese samples were 
judged as unacceptable. The best sensory properties were obtained in G5, G4, and 
G3 treatments, and recorded a relatively higher sensory evaluation scores. The 
best shelf-life extension was obtained in G5, G4, and G3 treatments.

BACKGROUND: Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) seems to be a promising 
treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. In Western countries 
(United States and Europe), there is a female predominance in IBS. A sex 
difference in the response to FMT has been reported recently in IBS patients.
AIM: To investigate whether there was a sex difference in the response to FMT in 
the IBS patients who were included in our previous randomized controlled trial 
of the efficacy of FMT.
METHODS: The study included 164 IBS patients who participated in our previous 
randomized controlled trial. These patients had moderate-to-severe IBS symptoms 
belonging to the IBS-D (diarrhoea-predominant), IBS-C (constipation-predominant) 
and IBS-M (mixed) subtypes, and had not responded to the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-modified diet. They belonged in three groups: 
placebo (own faeces), and active treated group (30-g or 60-g superdonor faeces). 
The patients completed the IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), Fatigue 
Assessment Scale (FAS) and the IBS quality of life scale (IBS-QoL) 
questionnaires at the baseline and 2 wk, 1 mo and 3 mo after FMT. They also 
provided faecal samples at the baseline and 1 mo after FMT. The faecal bacteria 
profile and dysbiosis were determined using the 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain 
reaction DNA amplification covering V3-V9; probe labelling by single nucleotide 
extension and signal detection. The levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) 
were determined by gas chromatography and flame ionization.
RESULTS: There was no sex difference in the response to FMT either in the 
placebo group or active treated group. There was no difference between females 
and males in either the placebo group or actively treated groups in the total 
score on the IBS-SSS, FAS or IBS-QoL, in dysbiosis, or in the faecal bacteria or 
SCFA level. However, the response rate was significantly higher in females with 
diarrhoea-predominant (IBS-D) than that of males at 1 mo, and 3 mo after FMT. 
Moreover, IBS-SSS total score was significantly lower in female patients with 
IBS-D than that of male patients both 1 mo and 3 mo after FMT.
CONCLUSION: There was no sex difference in the response to FMT among IBS 
patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms who had previously not responded to 
NICE-modified diet. However, female patients with IBS-D respond better and have 
higher reduction of symptoms than males after FMT.

Zielona Gora, Zielona Gora, Poland.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men, with a steadily rising 
incidence, affecting on average one in six men during their lifetime. The 
increase in morbidity is related to the increasing overall life expectancy, 
prostate-specific antigen testing, implementation of new molecular markers for 
cancer detection and the more frequent application of multiparametric magnetic 
resonance imaging. There is growing evidence demonstrating that active 
surveillance (AS) is an alternative to immediate intervention in patients with 
very low- and low-risk prostate cancer. Ongoing reports from multiple studies 
have consistently demonstrated a very low rate of metastases and prostate cancer 
specific mortality in selected cohorts of patients. As a matter of fact, AS has 
been adopted by many institutions as a safe and effective management strategy. 
The aim of our review is to summarize the contemporary data on AS in patients 
affected with PCa with the intention to present the most clinically useful and 
pertinent AS protocols.

Given the high perishability of pomegranate arils, edible antimicrobial coating 
will enhance their shelf life and maintain their marketability. An antimicrobial 
coating was prepared using 1% (w/v) soluble part of Persian gum (PG) and 
different concentrations (0.25%, 0.50%, and 0.75% (v/v)) of cinnamon essential 
oil (CEO) to extend the shelf life of pomegranate arils. Microbiological, 
chemical, physical, and sensorial characteristics of coated and uncoated samples 
were evaluated at 7-day intervals. Total anthocyanin (TAN), titrable acidity 
(TA), and ascorbic acid showed a decreasing trend, during the whole period of 
the storage. TAN, TA, and ascorbic acid decreased from 119.8 to 44.5 mg/L, 1.6% 
to 1.37%, and 682 to 140 mg/L, respectively. Firmness increased during the 
storage time, while total soluble solids (TSS, around 17.4 °Brix) and total 
phenolic compounds (TP, around 14.21 mg/100 ml) showed no significant changes 
with CEO concentrations. Coatings containing 0.5% and 0.75% CEO significantly 
prevented fungal growth on the samples at least for 3 weeks and 3 months, 
respectively. Optimization proved that 1-week cold storage and 0.43% CEO could 
dramatically meet 80% of the research targets including maximum nutritional 
quality and freshness, as well preventing microbial spoilage. It was concluded 
that coating the pomegranate arils by PG and selecting an appropriate 
concentration of the CEO could considerably increase shelf life, marketability, 
and nutritional quality of pomegranate arils at a suitable and acceptable level.

Total mortality and "burden of disease" in Germany and Italy and their states 
and regions were explored during the first COVID-19 wave by using publicly 
available data for 16 German states and 20 Italian regions from January 2016 to 
June 2020. Based on expectations from 2016 to 2019, simplified Standardized 
Mortality Ratios (SMRs) for deaths occurring in the first half of 2020 and the 
effect of changed excess mortality in terms of "burden of disease" were 
assessed. Moreover, whether two German states and 19 Italian cities 
appropriately represent the countries within the European monitoring of excess 
mortality for public health action (EuroMOMO) network was explored. 
Significantly elevated SMRs were observed (Germany: week 14-18, Italy: week 
11-18) with SMR peaks in week 15 in Germany (1.15, 95%-CI: 1.09-1.21) and in 
week 13 in Italy (1.79, 95%-CI: 1.75-1.83). Overall, SMRs were 1.00 (95%-CI: 
0.97-1.04) in Germany and 1.06 (95%-CI: 1.03-1.10) in Italy. Significant SMR 
heterogeneity was found within both countries. Age and sex were strong 
modifiers. Loss of life expectancy was 0.34 days (1.66 days in men) for Germany 
and 5.3 days (6.3 days in men) for Italy [with upper limits of 3 and 6 weeks 
among elderly populations (≥65 years) after maximum potential bias adjustments]. 
Restricted data used within EuroMOMO neither represents mortality in the 
countries as a whole nor in their states and regions adequately. Mortality 
analyses with high spatial and temporal resolution are needed to monitor the 
COVID-19 pandemic's course.

People who live in more deprived areas have poorer health outcomes, and this 
inequality is a major driver of health and social policy. Many interventions 
targeting these disparities implicitly assume that poorer health is 
predominantly associated with area-level factors, and that these inequalities 
are the same for men and women. However, health differentials due to individual 
socio-economic status (SES) of men and women are less well documented. We used 
census data linked to the ONS Longitudinal Study to derive individual-level SES 
in terms of occupation, education and estimated wage, and examined differences 
in adult mortality and life expectancy. We modelled age-, sex- and SES-specific 
mortality using Poisson regression, and summarised mortality differences using 
life expectancy at age 20. We compared the results to those calculated using 
area-level deprivation metrics. Wide inequalities in life expectancy between SES 
groups were observed, although differences across SES groups were smaller for 
women than for men. The widest inequalities were found across men's education 
(7.2-year (95% CI: 3.0-10.1) difference in life expectancy between groups) and 
wage (7.0-year (95% CI: 3.5-9.8) difference), and women's education (5.4-year 
(95% CI: 2.2-8.1) difference). Men with no qualifications had the lowest life 
expectancy of all groups. In terms of the number of years' difference in life 
expectancy, the inequalities measured here with individual-level data were of a 
similar magnitude to inequalities identified previously using area-level 
deprivation metrics. These data show that health inequalities are as strongly 
related to individual SES as to area-level deprivation, highlighting the 
complementary usefulness of these different metrics. Indeed, poor outcomes are 
likely to be a product of both community and individual influences. Current 
policy which bases health spending decisions on evidence of inequalities between 
geographical areas may overlook individual-level SES inequalities for those 
living in affluent areas, as well as missing important sex differences.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia family caregiving may span more than a decade and places 
many family care partners (CPs) at risk for poor bereavement outcomes; estimates 
of complicated grief in bereaved dementia family CPs range from 10% to 20%. We 
adapted our efficacious complicated grief group therapy intervention for 
bereaved dementia caregivers for soon-to-be bereaved dementia CPs at risk for 
complicated grief to facilitate healthy death preparedness and eventual 
bereavement-pre-loss group therapy (PLGT).
METHODS: In this Stage IB pilot intervention study, we implemented and evaluated 
PLGT in three psychotherapy group cohorts with family CPs at-risk for 
complicated grief whose person living with dementia (PLWD) had a life expectancy 
of 6 months or less and resided in a nursing home. PLGT is a 10-session 
multi-modal psychotherapy administered by social workers.
RESULTS: Participants in PLGT realized significant improvement in their pre-loss 
grief and in reported preparedness for the death of their family member, and 
participants evidenced lowered pre-loss grief severity and improvement, as 
measured by facilitators. Participants also realized significant improvement in 
meaning making, particularly as a sense of peace and a reduction of loneliness.
DISCUSSION: The process and treatment elements of the PLGT intervention affirm 
the value of specialized care for those dementia family CPs at risk for 
complicated grief, as the PLGT groups demonstrated a steady progression toward 
improvement collectively and individually. PLGT participants realized 
statistical and clinical improvement across pre-loss grief measures suggesting 
that their risk for complicated grief risk was mitigated, and they were better 
prepared for the death of their PLWD.

BACKGROUND: Patient-relevant health outcomes for persons with hemophilia should 
be identified and prioritized to optimize and individualize care for persons 
with hemophilia. Therefore, an international group of persons with hemophilia 
and multidisciplinary health care providers set out to identify a globally 
applicable standard set of health outcomes relevant to all individuals with 
hemophilia.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify possible 
health outcomes and risk adjustment variables. Persons with hemophilia and 
multidisciplinary health care providers were involved in an iterative nominal 
consensus process to select the most important health outcomes and risk 
adjustment variables for persons with hemophilia. Recommendations were made for 
outcome measurement instruments.
RESULTS: Persons with hemophilia were defined as all men and women with an 
X-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of coagulation 
factor VIII or IX with plasma activity levels <40 IU/dL. We recommend collecting 
the following 10 health outcomes at least annually, if applicable: (i) cure, 
(ii) impact of disease on life expectancy, (iii) ability to engage in normal 
daily activities, (iv) severe bleeding episodes, (v) number of days lost from 
school or work, (vi) chronic pain, (vii) disease and treatment complications, 
(viii) sustainability of physical functioning, (ix) social functioning, and (x) 
mental health. Validated clinical as well as patient-reported outcome 
measurement instruments were endorsed. Demographic factors, baseline clinical 
factors, and treatment factors were identified as risk-adjustment variables.
CONCLUSION: A consensus-based international set of health outcomes relevant to 
all persons with hemophilia, and corresponding measurement instruments, was 
identified for use in clinical care to facilitate harmonized longitudinal 
monitoring and comparison of outcomes.

Partial Personalization of Medical Treatment Decisions: Adverse Effects and 
Possible Solutions.

Weyant C(1), Brandeau ML(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University, 
Stanford, CA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Personalizing medical treatment decisions based on patient-specific 
risks and/or preferences can improve health outcomes. Decision makers frequently 
select treatments based on partial personalization (e.g., personalization based 
on risks but not preferences or vice versa) due to a lack of data about 
patient-specific risks and preferences. However, partially personalizing 
treatment decisions based on a subset of patient risks and/or preferences can 
result in worse population-level health outcomes than no personalization and can 
increase the variance of population-level health outcomes.
METHODS: We develop a new method for partially personalizing treatment decisions 
that avoids these problems. Using a case study of antipsychotic treatment for 
schizophrenia, as well as 4 additional illustrative examples, we demonstrate the 
adverse effects and our method for avoiding them.
RESULTS: For the schizophrenia treatment case study, using a previously proposed 
modeling approach for personalizing treatment decisions and using only a subset 
of patient preferences regarding treatment efficacy and side effects, mean 
population-level health outcomes decreased by 0.04 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs; 95% credible interval [crI]: 0.02-0.06) per patient compared with no 
personalization. Using our new method and considering the same subset of patient 
preferences, mean population-level health outcomes increased by 0.01 QALYs (95% 
crI: 0.00-0.03) per patient as compared with no personalization, and the 
variance decreased.
LIMITATIONS: We assumed a linear and additive utility function.
CONCLUSIONS: Selecting personalized treatments for patients should be done in a 
way that does not decrease expected population-level health outcomes and does 
not increase their variance, thereby resulting in worse risk-adjusted, 
population-level health outcomes compared with treatment selection with no 
personalization. Our method can be used to ensure this, thereby helping patients 
realize the benefits of treatment personalization without the potential harms.

[PREDICTING PARAMETERS WITH FOCUS ON PRESSURE ULCERS IN IDENTIFYING ADVANCED 
DEMENTIA MORTALITY].

Longer life expectancy exposes the older person to vulnerability, morbidity and 
disability and increases the risk of developing dementia. The number of elderly 
patients with dementia reaching the advanced stage is increasing in entire 
settings. This condition of poor quality of life existing over months and years, 
when the time of death cannot be predicted, raises dilemmas in medical and 
ethical decisions. Dementia is an incurable disease at the last stage of life, 
highlighting a therapeutic approach in the provision of palliative care with 
emphasis on the quality of life as a primary goal. In older age, any advanced 
chronic disease is incurable and palliative care includes life-long therapies 
with hospice-type supportive care. Advanced dementia stresses an aggravated 
approach, and the recommendation is to provide only hospice type palliative 
care. The purpose of this survey is to review the existing evidence in base 
evidence literature containing prognostic parameters indicating mortality at six 
months including cognitive, functional, nutrition and morbidity factors, and 
focusing on pressure ulcers. Thus, the goal is to allow the attending team and 
the families to make appropriate evidence based medical-ethical decisions. A 
systematic review of the medical literature found seven articles with indices 
predicting mortality within six months in patients with advanced dementia (5 
studies originated in the USA, 2 from Israel). The most common predictor 
variable in 100% of studies is eating and swallowing problems associated with 
the consequences of malnutrition and indigestion, weight loss and loss of 
appetite. The variable in 80% of the studies is background diseases including: 
cancer, heart failure, second-degree pressure ulcers, and lack of control of the 
sphincters. In 75% of cases, functional decline in personal care, level of 
consciousness and alertness are identified as variables, and in 60% of cases, 
mobility impairment unstable medical conditions and demographic conditions are 
diagnosed.
