OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a composite index of health inequity based on 
mortality by grouped causes.
METHODS: An ecological study in a middle-income Latin American country, with 
aggregate indicators available from municipalities and departments, which were 
selected from health observatories, research groups and health authorities. They 
were divided into intolerable and "not completely avoidable" according to 
current scientific progress, and were added in categories: traffic accident, 
aggression, kidney disease, HIV infection, intestinal parasitic diseases, 
syphilis, fecal / oral transmission disease, tuberculosis, disease Vector-borne 
diseases, respiratory disease, cerebral hemorrhagic / ischemic events, maternal 
mortality, lower mortality 5 years, meningitis. After analysis of main 
components, a composite index of health inequity (IIS) is obtained for men and 
women. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's Alpha coefficient. 
Concurrent validation was done with proportion of people in Unsatisfied Basic 
Needs (UBN), Human Development Index (HDI), Life Expectancy at Birth (LEB), 
among others.
RESULTS: IIS is built showing higher values for women in most municipalities and 
departments; And for sites with high HDI, high LEB and low UBN. Cronbach's alpha 
was 0.6688, IIS-men and 0.725, IIS-women.
CONCLUSIONS: An IIS was obtained, is valid and reproducible. The role of big 
cities in inequities in health is highlighted, probably due to the effect of 
intolerable health.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Desarrollar y validar un índice compuesto de inequidad en 
salud basado en mortalidad por grupos de causas.
MÉTODOS: Estudio ecológico en país de mediano ingreso latinoamericano, con 
indicadores agregados disponibles de municipios y departamentos, que se 
seleccionaron a partir de observatorios de salud, grupos de investigación y 
autoridades sanitarias. Se dividen en intolerables y "no completamente 
evitables" según el avance científico actual, y se agregan en categorías: 
accidente de tránsito, agresiones, enfermedad renal, infección por VIH, 
parasitosis intestinal, sífilis, enfermedad de transmisión fecal/oral, 
tuberculosis, enfermedad transmitidas por vectores, enfermedad respiratoria, 
eventos hemorrágicos/ isquémicos cerebrales, mortalidad materna, mortalidad 
menores 5 años, meningitis. Luego de análisis de componentes principales se 
obtiene índice compuesto multidimensional de inequidad en salud (IIS) para 
hombres y mujeres. Consistencia interna se evalúa mediante coeficiente Alpha de 
Cronbach. Se hace validación concurrente con proporción de personas en 
Necesidades Básicas Insatisfechas (NBI), Índice de Desarrollo Humano (IDH), 
Expectativa de Vida al Nacer (EVN) entre otros.
RESULTADOS: Se construye IIS que muestra valores más altos para las mujeres en 
la mayoría de municipios y departamentos; y para lugares con IDH alto, EVN alta 
y NBI bajas. El alpha de Cronbach fue 0.6688, IIS-hombres y 0.725, IIS-mujeres.
CONCLUSIONES: Se obtiene IIS factible, reproducible y mutidimensional. Se 
destaca el papel de las grandes ciudades en las inequidades en salud, 
probablemente por el efecto de los intolerables en salud.

[The significance of palliative surgery in castration-resistant prostate 
cancer].

[Article in German; Abstract available in German from the publisher]

roboter-assistierte Chirurgie, Universitätsklinikum Köln, Köln.

If prostate cancer recurs after primary treatment, deprivation therapy with LHRH 
analogues or antagonists is the treatment of choice in men with metastatic 
prostate cancer. However, this treatment only achieves palliative results. 
Median time to progression ranges between 11 and 78 months. After the 
introduction of Docetaxel as a first-line treatment in castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPCA) and cabazitaxel as a second-line chemotherapy, several 
new drugs containing abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium 223 and sipuleucel-T have 
become available, which can lead to complete or partial remissions in 
metastasis, but do not have an effect on the prostate itself as has been shown 
recently. As a result of local progression of CRPCA, local complications of the 
urinary tract such as subvesical obstruction, recurrent gross haematuria with or 
without clotting, upper urinary tract dilatation, rectourethral or rectovesical 
fistulae and rectal obstruction will occur in about one third of all patients. 
Several surgical treatment options are available to manage the aforementioned 
complications. In patients with local progressive CRPCA and lower urinary tract 
symptoms, palliative TUR-P, radical prostatectomy or radical cystoprostatectomy 
with urinary diversion and even anterior and posterior exenteration can be 
performed in selected patients, requiring a preoperative multiparametric MRI of 
the prostate and the pelvic floor along with a laboratory examination to 
optimise surgical techniques and perioperative outcomes. In case of symptomatic 
involvement of the upper urinary tract system, the placement of endoluminal DJ 
stents or percutaneous nephrostomy in men with a poor performance status and a 
short life expectancy is the treatment of choice. In men with an ECOG 
performance status of 0 to 1, reconstructive surgery such as ureteral 
reimplantation, ileal ureteral replacement or placement of a subcutaneous 
pyelovesical bypass is an appropriate treatment option. To summarise, the 
aforementioned palliative surgical treatment options should be provided for 
selected patients and performed by well-experienced urologists.

Publisher: LHRH-Analoga oder Antagonisten stellen das Mittel der Wahl beim 
metastasierten Prostatakarzinom dar. Trotz anfänglich meist guten Ansprechens 
hat diese Therapie nur einen palliativen Charakter und führt unweigerlich nach 
durchschnittlich 1,5 bis 2,5 Jahren zur Entwicklung eines kastrationsresistenten 
Prostatakarzinoms (KRPCA). In diesem Fall stehen neben der klassischen 
Taxan-basierten Chemotherapie, die sekundäre Hormonablation mit Enzalutamid und 
Abirateron, Sipuleucel T sowie Radium 223 als neuere Therapieverfahren zur 
Verfügung. Aufgrund der dadurch – je nach Therapieansprechen – verlängerten 
Überlebenszeit gewinnen behandlungswürdige Komplikationen durch das lokal 
progrediente KRPCA, Lokalrezidive oder pelvine Lymphknotenmetasen zunehmend an 
Bedeutung. Treten Komplikationen des unteren Harntrakts wie rezidivierende 
transfusionspflichtige Makrohämaturien mit oder ohne Blasentamponade, eine 
subvesikale Obstruktion mit der Notwendigkeit einer Harnableitung oder 
rektourethrale/rektovesikale Fisteln auf, stehen als palliative chirurgische 
Therapieoptionen die palliative TUR-P, die radikale (Zysto-) Prostatektomie mit 
entsprechender Harnableitung sowie die posteriore Exenteration bei rektaler 
Infiltration zur Verfügung. Bei Harnstauungsnieren aufgrund einer supravesikalen 
Obstruktion stehen je nach Erlebenserwartung und Allgemeinzustand des Patienten 
die Anlage einer endoluminalen Ureterschiene oder perkutanen Nephrostomie sowie 
chirurgisch rekonstruktive Maßnahmen wie die Ureterneoimplantation, 
Ureter-Ileum-Interponat oder Implantation eines Detour®-Systems als 
Therapieoptionen zur Verfügung.Letztlich stellt die palliative Tumorchirurgie 
ein individuelles Therapiekonzept dar, welches bei sorgfältiger 
Patientenselektion und adäquater chirurgischer Expertise zu einer Verbesserung 
der Lebensqualität und lokalen Tumorkontrolle führen kann.

[Symptomatic renal tumours in metastatic renal cell carcinoma - surgical 
options].

[Article in German; Abstract available in German from the publisher]

Lübeck.

Between 15 and 20 % of patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma suffer from 
metastatic disease by the time of diagnosis. In addition to systemic therapy, 
there are various surgical strategies to treat the primary tumour, e. g. 
cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) or palliative nephrectomy (PN). In the 
immunotherapy era, the standard treatment was to perform CN followed by 
interferon therapy, based on 2 prospective randomised trials and their combined 
analysis. Since the introduction of targeted therapy around 2005, data of that 
quality has been missing and clinicians have had to rely on big retrospective 
studies, which have confirmed the benefit of CN except for patients with low 
performance status, cerebral metastases, low life expectancy, and old age. The 
recently published results of the CARMENA trial, which compared the use of 
sunitinib versus CN followed by sunitinib in a prospective randomised trial, 
have now demonstrated non-inferiority of sunitinib alone in patients classified 
as having intermediate-risk or poor-risk disease. Nevertheless, these results 
remain debatable given the large number of patients with poor-risk disease and a 
higher percentage of locally advanced tumours in the nephrectomy-sunitinib 
group. Indications for palliative nephrectomy are pain, haemorrhage, or severe 
paraneoplastic syndrome. Since there are excellent supportive and less invasive 
therapies, e. g. angioembolisation in case of haemorrhage, the decision in 
favour of surgical intervention should be based on the characteristics of the 
primary tumour, individual risk factors, and alternative therapies. Technically, 
palliative nephrectomy can be performed as an open or laparoscopic procedure and 
even as a partial nephrectomy, if indicated.

Publisher: Jährlich erkranken in Deutschland über 14 000 Menschen an einem 
Nierenzellkarzinom. Bei 15 – 20 % liegen bei Diagnosestellung bereits Metastasen 
vor. Neben der medikamentösen Tumortherapie existieren auch chirurgische 
Konzepte bei der Behandlung des Primärtumors. Hierbei stehen die zytoreduktive 
sowie die palliative Nephrektomie (palliative nephrectomy, PN) im Vordergrund. 
Abhängig vom Wandel der systemischen Tumortherapie wurde auch die Sinnhaftigkeit 
der zytoreduktiven Nephrektomie (cytoreductive nephrectomy, CN) diskutiert. In 
der „Zytokin-Ära” etablierte sich die CN gefolgt von einer Therapie mit 
Interferon basierend auf 2 prospektiven randomisierten Studien und deren 
kombinierter Metaanalyse. Durch die Etablierung von Targeted-Therapien ab 2005 
und das reine Vorliegen von retrospektiven Studien mit teilweise großen 
Patientenzahlen wurde der Stellenwert der CN kritisch hinterfragt. Mit der 
Veröffentlichung der CARMENA-Daten liegen nun aktuell erstmalig Daten vor, die 
die alleinige Therapie mit Sunitinib mit der CN gefolgt von Sunitinib 
vergleichen. Hierbei konnte gezeigt werden, dass die alleinige medikamentöse 
Therapie der kombinierten Therapie nicht unterlegen war – zumindest in der 
Gruppe der intermediate- und poor-risk Patienten. Nichtsdestotrotz bleiben auch 
diese Daten aufgrund diverser Kritikpunkte, wie dem hohen Anteil von Patienten 
mit poor-risk Konstellation sowie dem höheren Anteil von lokal fortgeschrittenen 
Tumorstadien im CN + Sunitinib-Arm, auf dem Prüfstand.Als Gründe für eine 
palliative Nephrektomie werden therapierefraktäre Schmerzen, Blutungen sowie 
schwere paraneoplastische Syndrome aufgeführt. Hierbei muss bei der 
Indikationsstellung berücksichtigt werden, dass gute supportive 
Therapiemaßnahmen und weniger invasive Therapien verfügbar sind. So können z. B. 
Blutungen durch Maßnahmen der interventionellen Radiologie in einer Vielzahl der 
Fälle adäquat kontrolliert werden.Im Rahmen der Entscheidungsfindung ist es 
unerlässlich, neben den Therapiealternativen, den Lokalbefund des Primärtumors 
sowie individuelle Risikofaktoren zu evaluieren.Rein technisch kann die 
palliative Nephrektomie offen oder laparoskopisch erfolgen und falls indiziert 
auch als Teilnephrektomie.

Controlling Cell Adhesion and Detachment by Dual Stimulation of Temperature and 
Mechanical Stress.

Stretchable temperature-responsive cell culture surfaces composed of poly( 
N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm) gel-grafted polydimethylsiloxane (PIPAAm-PDMS) 
were prepared to demonstrate that dual stimulation of temperature and mechanical 
stress extensively altered graft polymer thickness, surface wettability, and 
cell detachment behavior. The PIPAAm-PDMS surface was hydrophilic and 
hydrophobic below and above the lower critical solution temperature, 
respectively, which was ascribed to the phase transition of PIPAAm chains. When 
uniaxial stretching was applied, the grafted PIPAAm gel surface was modulated to 
be more hydrophobic as shown by an increase in the contact angle. Atomic force 
microscopy observation revealed that uniaxial stretching made the grafted gel 
layer thinner and deformed the nanoscale aggregates of the grafted PIPAAm gel, 
implying extension of the PIPAAm chains. The stretched PIPAAm-PDMS became more 
cell adhesive than the unstretched PIPAAm-PDMS at 37 °C. Furthermore, dual 
stimulation, shrinking the already stretched PIPAAm-PDMS and decreasing the 
temperature, induced more rapid cell detachment than only a change in 
temperature did. Similarly, upon comparison with a single stimulation of a 
change in temperature or mechanical stress, dual stimulation accelerated cell 
sheet detachment and harvesting. This new stretchable and temperature-responsive 
culture surface can easily adjust the surface property to a different cell 
adhesiveness by appropriately combining each stimulus and enable the fabrication 
of cell sheets of various species.

BACKGROUND: Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, 
which is a potentially life threatening disease endemic in Southeast Asian 
countries. In Malaysia, cystic fibrosis (CF) is an uncommon condition. The 
association between CF and B.pseudomallei infections has been reported 
previously. However, this is the first case report of a pediatric melioidosis 
relapse and co-infection with other Gram-negative bacteria in Malaysia.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old Chinese Malaysian boy presented with a history 
of recurrent pneumonia, poor growth and steatorrhoea since childhood, and was 
diagnosed with CF. B. pseudomallei was cultured from his sputum during three 
different admissions between 2013 and 2016. However, the patient succumbed to 
end stage of respiratory failure in 2017 despite antibiotics treatment against 
B.pseudomallei. The isolates were compared using multilocus-sequence typing and 
repetitive-element polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and confirmed that two of 
the isolates were of same sequence type, which may indicate relapse.
CONCLUSIONS: CF patients should be aware of melioidosis in endemic regions, as 
it is an emerging infectious disease, especially when persistent or recurrent 
respiratory symptoms and signs of infection occur. The high prevalence rates of 
melioidosis in Malaysia warrants better management options to improve quality of 
life, and life expectancy in patients with CF. Travel activities to endemic 
regions should also be given more consideration, as this would be crucial to 
identify and initiate appropriate empiric treatment.

BACKGROUND: Psychotic disorders are severe mental health conditions that 
adversely affect the quality of life and life expectancy. Schizophrenia, the 
most common and severe form of psychosis affects 21 million people globally. 
Informal caregivers (families) are known to play an important role in 
facilitating patient recovery outcomes, although their own health and well-being 
could be adversely affected by the illness. The application of novel digital 
interventions in mental health care for patient groups is rapidly expanding; 
interestingly, however, far less is known about their role with family 
caregivers.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically identify the application of 
digital interventions that focus on informal caregivers of people with psychosis 
and describe their outcomes.
METHODS: We completed a search for relevant papers in four electronic databases 
(EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science). The search also included the 
Cochrane database and manual search of reference lists of relevant papers. The 
search was undertaken in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines.
RESULTS: The search identified 9 studies derived from 8 unique datasets. Most 
studies were assessments of feasibility and were undertaken in the United 
States. Interventions were predominately Web-based, with a focus on improving 
the caregivers' knowledge and understanding about psychosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers preliminary support for the feasibility and 
acceptability of digital interventions for psychosis in informal caregiver 
populations. However, the findings underpin a clear need for greater development 
in the range of caregiver-focused digital approaches on offer and robust 
evaluation of their outcomes. The use of digital approaches with caregiver 
populations seemingly lags someway behind the significant developments observed 
in patient groups.

BACKGROUND: Due to the sustained increases in life expectancy over the past half 
century, the elderly today will receive supports from their children for a 
longer period than ever before. Therefore, understanding the spillover effects 
of children's socioeconomic status on parents' health becomes increasingly 
important for both scholars and policy makers.
METHODS: The Ordinary Least Squares regression is applied to the China Health 
and Retirement Longitudinal Study 2011, a national representative dataset 
including approximately 10 000 households and 17 600 middle-aged and elderly 
respondents. The Sobel test is used to examine the mediation role of social 
integration.
RESULTS: The elderly who have a cadre child reported better health 
(coefficient=0.1347; 95% CI 0.067 to 0.202), had fewer activities of daily 
living (ADLs) limitations (coefficient=-0.1289; 95% CI -0.216 to -0.042) and 
were more socially integrated (coefficient=0.2321; 95% CI 0.103 to 0.361). Such 
effects are mainly driven by the parents of higher-ranking cadres. For the 
parents of higher ranking cadres, the Sobel test suggests that 12.6% of the 
total effects on self-reported health and 21.9% of the total effects on ADL 
limitations are mediated by the increase in parents' social integration.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest positive spillover effects of children's 
political status on parents' health. The benefits of having a cadre child are at 
least equivalent to the rural-urban gap in health and even stronger for the 
parents of higher ranking cadres. One potential explanation for such spillover 
effects is that a child's political status can improve parents' community 
involvement and social interactions.

[Thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms].

[Article in Japanese]

Asakura H(1).

Author information:

Medicine.

Among all types of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), polycythemia vera (PV) 
and essential thrombocythemia (ET) require careful management of both thrombosis 
and hemostasis. One recent concern associated with MPNs is the JAK2 mutation 
(V617F). This mutation is essential for MPN pathology, but it has also garnered 
attention for its association with thrombosis. Several studies have reported the 
mechanisms underlying the onset of thrombosis in both PV and ET and have also 
discussed the association between JAK2 mutations and thrombotic tendencies. 
Arterial thrombosis is a common clinical symptom that is associated with the 
diagnosis and course of both PV and ET. Particularly, cerebral infarction has 
been identified as the leading cause of death in patients with untreated PV. 
Notably, PV and ET are also associated with a high incidence of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE). The occurrence of this type of thrombosis at atypical 
sites, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis 
(SVT), is not uncommon. Generally, patients with PV and ET have good life 
expectancy; their treatment essentially focuses on dealing with thrombosis and 
bleeding. Phlebotomy may be used for treating patients with PV; however, 
low-dose aspirin is used to prevent the onset of arterial thrombosis. For 
patients with a history of VTE, oral anticoagulants are commonly prescribed to 
prevent recurrence.

AIMS: To describe cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus platinum and 
pemetrexed chemotherapy in metastatic, non-squamous, NSCLC patients in the US.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model is developed utilizing partitioned survival 
analysis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of KEYNOTE-189 trial comparators 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed) vs 
chemotherapy alone. Clinical efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility, 
and safety data are derived from the trial and projected over 20 years. For 
extrapolating survival beyond the trial, a novel SEER population-data approach 
is applied (primary analysis), with separate estimation via traditional 
parametric extrapolation methods. Costs for drugs and non-drug disease 
management are also incorporated. Based on an indirect treatment comparison, 
cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs pembrolizumab monotherapy 
is evaluated for patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) ≥ 50%.
RESULTS: In the full non-squamous population, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is 
projected to increase life expectancy by 2.04 years vs chemotherapy (3.96 vs 
1.92), for an approximate doubling of life years. Resultant incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are $104,823/QALY and $87,242/life year. In 
patients with PD-L1 ≥ 50% and 1-49%, life expectancy is more than doubled (4.53 
vs 1.88 years) and (4.87 vs 2.01 years), with a 32% (2.60 vs 1.97 years) 
increase in PD-L1 < 1% patients. Corresponding incremental 
costs/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are $103,402, $66,837, and $183,529 for 
PD-L1 ≥ 50%, 1-49%, and <1% groups, respectively. Versus pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in PD-L1 ≥ 50% patients, representing current standard of care, 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy increases life expectancy by 65% (4.53 vs 2.74 
years) at an ICER of $147,365/QALY.
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is 
projected to extend life expectancy to a point not previously seen in previously 
untreated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Although ICERs vary by sub-group and 
comparator, results suggest pembrolizumab + chemotherapy yields ICERs near, or 
in most cases, well below a 3-times US per capita GDP threshold of 
$180,000/QALY, and may be a cost-effective first-line treatment for metastatic 
non-squamous NSCLC patients.

BACKGROUND: Although existing psoriasis treatments are effective and well 
tolerated in many patients, there is still a need for new effective targeted 
treatment options. Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor that has been 
investigated in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
OBJECTIVES: To consider the benefits and risks of tofacitinib in patients with 
moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
METHODS: Data were pooled from one phase II, four phase III and one long-term 
extension study comprising 5204 patient-years of tofacitinib treatment. Efficacy 
end points included patients achieving Physician's Global Assessments of 'clear' 
or 'almost clear', ≥ 75% and ≥ 90% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity 
Index (coprimary end points) and improvements in Dermatology Life Quality Index 
score, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression score and Itch Severity 
Item score, at weeks 16 and 52. Safety data were summarized for 3 years of 
tofacitinib exposure.
RESULTS: Tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg twice daily (BID) showed superiority over 
placebo for all efficacy end points at week 16, with response maintained for 52 
weeks of continued treatment. Tofacitinib improved patients' quality of life and 
was well tolerated. Rates of safety events of interest (except herpes zoster) 
were similar to those in the published literature and healthcare databases for 
other systemic psoriasis therapies. Tofacitinib 10 mg BID demonstrated greater 
efficacy than 5 mg BID.
CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib has a benefit-risk profile in moderate-to-severe 
psoriasis consistent with that of other systemic treatments.

INTRODUCTION: Aortic valve replacement surgery is done to increase patients' 
life expectancy and improve their health-related quality of life. Several 
published studies have found improvement in health-related quality of life after 
this procedure, but none have involved patients in Portugal. This study sought 
to evaluate patients' health-related quality of life after the implantation of 
aortic prostheses and compare these values with preoperative health-related 
quality of life and the general Portuguese population's health-related quality 
of life.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was done with elective patients who 
underwent implantation of an aortic prosthesis between August 2011 and April 
2016. Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the Short Form 36 
Health Survey and Short Form 6 Health Survey questionnaires in the preoperative 
period and 3, 6 and 12 months post-surgery. Descriptive and inferential analyses 
were conducted to process the data and compare preoperative health-related 
quality of life with postoperative values and the Portuguese population's norms.
RESULTS: The sample included 506 patients with an average age of 70.6 years. The 
majority are male (53.6%). The postoperative results show a statistically 
significant improvement compared to preoperative health-related quality of life 
in all eight dimensions of the Short Form 36 Health Survey. When contrasted with 
the general Portuguese population, patients' health-related quality of life is 
lower in the preoperative period, improving postoperatively and reaching higher 
than average health-related quality of life levels in some subgroups of patients 
and in various dimensions. An analysis of the Short Form 6 Health Survey results 
revealed that the patients undergoing this surgery have a higher level of 
preoperative problems compared with the general population, but these patients' 
values approach those of the general population by the end of one year 
post-surgery.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study in Portugal that compares health-related 
quality of life using a validated scale, before and after the aortic prosthesis 
implantation surgery. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in all 
dimensions, which is not consistently observed in other published studies.
CONCLUSION: The results confirm that the implantation of aortic prostheses 
improves patients' health-related quality of life, over time bringing it close 
to the general population's levels.

Publisher: Introdução: O objetivo da cirurgia de substituição valvular aórtica é 
o aumento da esperança de vida e a melhoria da qualidade de vida relacionada com 
a saúde. Existem vários estudos que evidenciam melhoria da qualidade de vida 
relacionada com a saúde nestes doentes, mas não aplicados à população 
portuguesa. O objetivo deste estudo é avaliar a qualidade de vida relacionada 
com a saúde pós-implantação de prótese aórtica e comparar com a qualidade de 
vida relacionada com a saúde pré-operatória e da população em geral. Material e 
Métodos: Foi feito um estudo retrospetivo de doentes eletivos submetidos a 
implantação de prótese aórtica entre agosto de 2011 e abril de 2016. A qualidade 
de vida relacionada com a saúde foi avaliada com o Short Form 36 Health Survey 
Instrument e com o Short Form 6 Health Survey Instrument no pré-operatório e aos 
3, 6 e 12 meses pós-cirurgia. Foram realizadas análises descritivas e 
inferenciais para analisar globalmente a amostra e para comparar a qualidade de 
vida relacionada com a saúde pré-operatória com a pós-operatória e com as normas 
da população portuguesa. Resultados: Foram incluídos 506 doentes, com idade 
média de 70,6 anos, sendo 53,6% do sexo masculino. Os resultados do 
pós-operatório evidenciam uma melhoria estatisticamente significativa quando 
comparados com o pré-operatório nas oito dimensões do Short Form 36 Health 
Survey Instrument. Comparando com a população Portuguesa em geral, a qualidade 
de vida relacionada com a saúde dos doentes é inferior no pré-operatório, 
melhorando no pós-operatório, atingindo níveis de qualidade de vida relacionada 
com a saúde superiores nalguns subgrupos de doentes e em algumas dimensões. Os 
resultados do Short Form 6 Health Survey Instrument revelam maior intensidade de 
problemas no pré-operatório quando comparados com a população em geral, 
aproximando-se dos valores população em geral ao final de um ano pós-cirurgia. 
Discussão: Este é o primeiro estudo realizado em Portugal que compara a 
qualidade de vida relacionada com a saúde, usando uma escala validada, antes e 
depois da cirurgia de implantação de prótese aórtica. Os resultados demonstram a 
existência de uma melhoria significativa em todas as dimensões, o que não 
acontece consistentemente noutros estudos publicados. Conclusão: A implantação 
de prótese aórtica melhora a qualidade de vida relacionada com a saúde dos 
doentes, permitindo que esta se aproxime dos resultados da população em geral.

OBJECTIVE: Patients receiving treatment for advanced cancer suffer significant 
symptom burden, including co-occurring pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. 
There is limited evidence for effective interventions targeting this common 
symptom cluster.
METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of a brief cognitive-behavioral 
strategies (CBS) intervention was conducted. A sample of 164 patients with 
advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy practiced imagery, relaxation, and 
distraction exercises or listened to cancer education recordings 
(attention-control) to manage co-occurring pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance 
over a 9-week period. Symptom cluster severity, distress, and interference with 
daily life were measured at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 weeks. We also evaluated 
the moderating influence of imaging ability and number of concurrent symptoms, 
and mediating effects of changes in stress, anxiety, outcome expectancy, and 
perceived control over symptoms.
RESULTS: Compared with the cancer education condition, participants receiving 
the CBS intervention reported less symptom cluster distress at week 6 (M = 1.82 
vs 2.15 on a 0-4 scale, P < .05). No other group differences were statistically 
significant. The number of concurrent symptoms moderated the intervention effect 
on symptom cluster interference. Changes in stress, outcome expectancy, and 
perceived control mediated the extent of intervention effects on symptom 
outcomes, primarily at weeks 6 and 9.
CONCLUSIONS: The brief CBS intervention had limited effects in this trial. 
However, findings regarding potential mediators affirm hypothesized mechanisms 
and provide insight into ways to strengthen future interventions to reduce the 
suffering associated with co-occurring pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.

OBJECTIVE: Cancer patients often have to face increasing levels of existential 
distress (ED) during disease progression, especially when nearing death. This 
cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of the dignity-related 
existential distress (DR-ED) in a sample of end-of-life cancer patients, and to 
explore the "existential distress" Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI-IT) subscale 
internal structure and its associations with different coping strategies.
METHODS: Two hundred seven cancer inpatients with a Karnofsky Performance Status 
≤50 and a life expectancy of 4 months or less have been examined with the 
following self-report measures: PDI-IT, Demoralization Scale (DS-IT) and Brief 
Coping Orientation to Problem Experienced (Brief-COPE). The existential distress 
PDI-IT subscale factor structure was explored through principal component 
analysis, and the DR-ED associations with the other considered variables were 
examined through X2 tests, MANOVA, and multivariate regression analysis.
RESULTS: Dignity-related existential distress was a problem/major problem for 
18.8% of the patients, especially for the younger (F(1, 205) = 3.40; P = 0.020) 
and more demoralized (F(1, 205) = 20.36; P < 0.001) individuals. Factor analysis 
supported 2 dimensions labeled "self-discontinuity" and "loss of personal 
autonomy," accounting for 58% of the variance. Positive reframing (β = -0.146, 
P < 0.05) and self-blame (β = 0.247, P < 0.001) coping styles emerged as DR-ED 
significant predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed how DR-ED is a relevant problem for patients 
nearing death and furthermore highlighted 2 underlying factors. Finally, the 
research has shown that positive reframing and self-blame coping styles might be 
clinically relevant elements for interventions on ED.

BACKGROUND: The most appropriate treatment of pathological fractures from 
metastatic disease depends on several factors, one of the most important being 
predicted life expectancy. The aim of this study was to identify the variables 
that influence prognosis and utilise these to develop a novel scoring system to 
better predict life expectancy post-pathological fracture.
METHODS: The records of all patients that presented with metastatic pathological 
fractures over a 10-year period from the only tertiary orthopaedic departments 
in Western Australia were retrospectively examined. Variables assessed were 
primary cancer type, fracture site, fixation method, cement augmentation, 
pre-morbid level of physical functioning, complication rate, treatment with 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy and appendicular, spinal and visceral metastatic 
load.
RESULTS: A total of 233 patients were included. Median survival from fracture to 
death was 4.1 months. Median time from cancer diagnosis to pathological fracture 
was 14.2 months. There was a statistically significant association between 
patient survival and primary cancer type, physical functional score, spinal 
metastatic burden and use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
CONCLUSION: A novel scoring system has been developed that offers a survival 
probability based on patient's individual circumstances. This can guide 
specialist management and offer patients a more accurate expectation of 
functional outcome and survival time.

RNA helicases are almost ubiquitous important enzymes that take part in multiple 
aspects of RNA metabolism. Prokaryotes encode fewer RNA helicases than 
eukaryotes, suggesting that individual prokaryotic RNA helicases may take on 
multiple roles. The specific functions and molecular mechanisms of bacterial 
DEAH/RHA helicases are poorly understood, and no structures are available of 
these bacterial enzymes. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the 
DEAH/RHA helicase HrpB of Escherichia coli in a complex with ADP•AlF4. It showed 
an atypical globular structure, consisting of two RecA domains, an HA2 domain 
and an OB domain, similar to eukaryotic DEAH/RHA helicases. Notably, it showed a 
unique C-terminal extension that has never been reported before. Activity assays 
indicated that EcHrpB binds RNA but not DNA, and does not exhibit unwinding 
activity in vitro. Thus, within cells, the EcHrpB may function in helicase 
activity-independent RNA metabolic processes.

Obesity is a common nutrition-related disorder leading to reduced life 
expectancy in both humans and dogs. With the aim of identifying new prevention 
and control options, the study objectives were (1) to investigate dog-owner 
perceptions about obesity in terms of themselves and their dogs, and (2) to 
identify factors associated with obesity and possible social, environmental and 
economic drivers for its development in dog owners and their pets. A 
cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was performed across multiple 
countries. The questionnaire focused on human and canine obesity, associated 
factors and potential drivers, and was distributed online and in the form of 
hard copies among dog owners in 11 European countries. In total, 3,185 responses 
from ten countries were included in multivariable analyses. Between 19.1% and 
48.8% of the dog owners reported to be overweight/obese. Owner-reported 
overweight/obesity in dogs ranged from 6.0% to 31.3% based on body condition 
score charts, and 31.8% to 69.4% based on body fat index charts. Common factors 
associated with obesity in owners and their dogs were age, gender and owners' 
attitudes to diet and physical activity. Dog owners who did not consider obesity 
to be a disease were more likely to have obese dogs.
