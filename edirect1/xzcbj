structural transitions from a reactant state to a product state as an extension 
to the original SDS. In the extended SDS, the inner product (IP) between the 
reactant and the snapshots generated by short-time MD simulations are evaluated 
and ranked according to the IPs at every cycle. Then, the snapshots with low IPs 
are selected as initial structures for the short-time MD simulations. This 
scheme enables one to choose dissimilar and distant initial structures from the 
reactant, and thus the initial structures dynamically head towards the product, 
promoting structural transitions from the reactant. To confirm the 
conformational sampling efficiency, the extended SDS was applied to maltodextrin 
binding protein (MBP), and we successfully reproduced the structural transition 
from the open to closed states with submicrosecond-order simulation times. 
However, a conventional long-time MD simulation failed to reproduce the same 
structural transition. We also compared the performance with that obtained by 
the ordinary SDS and other sampling techniques that have been developed by us to 
characterize the possible utility of the extended SDS for actual applications. ©

BACKGROUND: Individuals with psychiatric disorders incur an increased risk of 
morbidity and mortality, with higher prevalence of cardio-metabolic risk factors 
s largely contributing to a significant reduction in life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was at evaluating the clinical 
effectiveness of an educational intervention targeting lifestyle habits in 
patients with mood and psychotic disorders.
METHODS: Patients (n = 32) were randomly assigned to receive, in addition to the 
pharmacological treatment, either five sessions of group psychoeducation focused 
on healthy lifestyle or five sessions of a control group therapy.
RESULTS: Both psychopathological severity (i.e. the brief psychiatric rating 
scale) and lifestyle quality (i.e. physical activity, sleep quality and 
adherence to the Mediterranean diet) improved significantly over time in 
patients who underwent specific psychoeducational sessions but not in the 
controls.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings add to the accumulating evidence that educational 
interventions focused on lifestyle habits can ameliorate general and mental 
health in patients with psychiatric disorders and suggest that educational 
programs represent an effective non-pharmacological intervention to manage 
drug-induced cardiometabolic disturbances.

BACKGROUND: The revised version of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR) 
is one of the most widely used specific questionnaires in FM studies. However, 
this questionnaire does not allow calculation of QALYs as it is not a 
preference-based measure. The aim of this study was to develop mapping algorithm 
which enable FIQR scores to be transformed into utility scores that can be used 
in the cost utility analyses.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. One hundred and 92 Spanish 
women with Fibromyalgia were asked to complete four general quality of life 
questionnaires, i.e. EQ-5D-5 L, 15D, AQoL-8D and SF-12, and one specific disease 
instrument, the FIQR. A direct mapping approach was adopted to derive mapping 
algorithms between the FIQR and each of the four multi-attribute utility (MAU) 
instruments. Health state utility was treated as the dependent variable in the 
regression analysis, whilst the FIQR score and age were predictors.
RESULTS: The mean utility scores ranged from 0.47 (AQoL-8D) to 0.69 (15D). All 
correlations between the FIQR total score and MAU instruments utility scores 
were highly significant (p < 0.0001) with magnitudes larger than 0.5. Although 
very slight differences in the mean absolute error were found between ordinary 
least squares (OLS) estimator and generalized linear model (GLM), models based 
on GLM were better for EQ-5D-5 L, AQoL-8D and 15D.
CONCLUSION: Mapping algorithms developed in this study enable the estimation of 
utility values from scores in a fibromyalgia specific questionnaire.

BACKGROUND: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic connective-tissue disease 
responsible for reduced life expectancy, disability and a decreased quality of 
life. In order to optimize patients-physicians relationship and care strategy we 
aimed to survey views of patients on SSc and its management to reveal potential 
hurdles and improve health care strategies.
METHODS: A qualitative study combined semi-structured interviews, focus groups, 
and a direct observation of an information session was performed between 
November 2008 and January 2009.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with SSc were included. They encounter 
difficulties to have a clear representation of their disease. Physical, 
psychological, and social repercussions of SSc may lead to a psychological 
distress and different coping strategies, which widely differ among interviewed 
patients. Patients' views on their therapeutic journey and the management of 
their disease highlighted strong expectations about patient-physician 
relationship. These expectations were numerous, complex and sometimes 
ambivalent. Patients expected physicians to be human and attentive but also 
involved in research in the field and to provide psychological and affective 
support to help them to accept the uncertainty of disease evolution and lack of 
curative treatment. They also expected more individualized management, 
improvements in diagnosis and follow-up organization, more efforts in education 
and information, comprehensive behaviors and support from working colleagues and 
relatives, and increased funding from the health care system.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SSc management could be optimized, 
particularly with more attention to the patient-practitioner relationship. 
Patient profiles should be more precisely defined in terms of coping strategies 
and treatment preferences to propose more individualized options.

Long-term clinical outcomes following treatment with alpha 1-proteinase 
inhibitor for COPD associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a look at the 
evidence.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a common hereditary disorder caused by 
mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, which encodes alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT; also 
known as alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, A1-PI). An important function of A1-PI in 
the lung is to inhibit neutrophil elastase, one of various proteolytic enzymes 
released by activated neutrophils during inflammation. Absence or deficiency of 
A1-PI leads to an imbalance between elastase and anti-elastase activity, which 
results in progressive, irreversible destruction of lung tissue, and ultimately 
the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with early-onset 
emphysema. AATD is under-diagnosed, patients can experience long delays before 
obtaining an accurate diagnosis, and the consequences of delayed diagnosis or 
misdiagnosis can be severe. Currently, A1-PI therapy is the only available 
treatment that addresses disease etiology in patients with AATD; however, 
demonstrating clinical efficacy of A1-PI therapy is challenging. In order to 
show therapeutic efficacy with traditional endpoints such as forced expiratory 
volume in one second and mortality, large sample sizes and longer duration 
trials are required. However, AATD is a rare, slow progressive disease, which 
can take decades to manifest clinically and recruiting sufficient numbers of 
patients into prolonged placebo-controlled trials remains a significant 
obstacle. Despite this, the Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of augmentation 
therapy in Alpha 1-Proteinase Inhibitor Deficiency (RAPID) and RAPID Extension 
trial, the largest clinical program completed to date, utilized quantitative 
chest computed tomography as a sensitive and specific measure of the extent of 
emphysema. Findings from the RAPID/RAPID Extension program definitively 
confirmed the benefits of A1-PI therapy in slowing disease progression and 
provided evidence of a disease-modifying effect of A1-PI therapy in patients 
with AATD. These findings suggest that the early introduction of treatment in 
patients with severe emphysema-related AATD may delay the time to death, lung 
transplantation or crippling respiratory complaints. In addition, there is now 
limited evidence that A1-PI therapy provides a gain of more than five 
life-years, supporting previous observations based on registry data. With the 
clinical efficacy of A1-PI therapy now demonstrated, further studies are 
required to assess long-term outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: Second-line chemotherapy in recurrent and/or metastatic head and 
neck cancer (r/mHNSCC) patients showed dismal results with limited tumor 
response and reduced life expectancy. Outside of clinical trials, data on 
efficacy of second line treatment after first line anti-EGFR-AB combination 
therapy are not available.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data regarding r/mHNSCC consecutive pts treated with 
cetuximab and platinum from 2009 to 2014 at our center were retrospectively 
collected. The analyses of response, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall 
Survival (OS), each evaluated starting from first and second-line treatment, 
were performed. Survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and 
compared using the log-rank test.
RESULTS: We identified 117 patients treated with first-line platinum and 
cetuximab-based therapy. Sixty-four (55%) patients did not receive second-line 
treatment due to worsening in performance status, 2 were not assessable for 
response thus 51 patients were included for analysis. Fifty-six percent were 
smokers/former smokers and 78% were male. Primary tumor sites were oropharynx 
(39%), oral cavity (31%), larynx/hypopharynx (24%) and others (6%). Regimens 
used in second-line were mostly monotherapies. Twenty-one % of the patients were 
treated within a clinical trial. Response rate (PR, CR) was 6% with 45% showing 
SD as best response. Median PFS was 2.2months (95%CI:1.5-2.8months) and OS 
6.1months (95%CI:3.7-7.2months).
CONCLUSIONS: Within our single center experience only half of the patients with 
r/mHNSCC were able to receive second-line treatment. Response rate was 
unsatisfactory, but median OS seems higher than previously reported in an 
anti-EGFR-AB naïve population (Leon 2005).

BACKGROUND: Compared to non-indigenous populations, indigenous populations 
experience disproportionately greater morbidity, and a reduced life expectancy; 
however, conflicting data exist regarding whether a higher risk of fracture is 
experienced by either population. We systematically evaluate evidence for 
whether differences in fracture rates at any skeletal site exist between 
indigenous and non-indigenous populations of any age, and to identify potential 
risk factors that might explain these differences.
METHODS: On 31 August 2016 we conducted a comprehensive computer-aided search of 
peer-reviewed literature without date limits. We searched PubMed, OVID, MEDLINE, 
CINAHL, EMBASE, and reference lists of relevant publications. The protocol for 
this systematic review is registered in PROSPERO, the International Prospective 
Register of systematic reviews (CRD42016043215). Using the World Health 
Organization reference population as standard, hip fracture incidence rates were 
re-standardized for comparability between countries.
RESULTS: Our search yielded 3227 articles; 283 potentially eligible articles 
were cross-referenced against predetermined criteria, leaving 27 articles for 
final inclusion. Differences in hip fracture rates appeared as 
continent-specific, with lower rates observed for indigenous persons in all 
countries except for Canada and Australia where the opposite was observed. 
Indigenous persons consistently had higher rates of trauma-related fractures; 
the highest were observed in Australia where craniofacial fracture rates were 
22-times greater for indigenous compared to non-indigenous women. After 
adjustment for socio-demographic and clinical risk factors, approximately a 
three-fold greater risk of osteoporotic fracture and five-fold greater risk of 
craniofacial fractures was observed for indigenous compared to non-indigenous 
persons; diabetes, substance abuse, comorbidity, lower income, locality, and 
fracture history were independently associated with an increased risk of 
fracture.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed paucity of data and suggestion of continent-specific 
differences indicate an urgent need for further research regarding indigenous 
status and fracture epidemiology and aetiology. Our findings also have 
implications for communities, governments and healthcare professionals to 
enhance the prevention of trauma-related fractures in indigenous persons, and an 
increased focus on modifiable lifestyle behaviours to prevent osteoporotic 
fractures in all populations.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a pulmonary vasculopathy associated 
with abnormal cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and a limited life expectancy due to 
right heart failure. Young women are preferentially affected. Women with PAH are 
at increased risk of complications and death during pregnancy for both the 
mother and the fetus. While it is not well characterized how changes in sex 
steroids and other hormones during pregnancy affect pulmonary hypertension, many 
expected systemic and heart–lung physiologic adaptations during gestation are 
poorly tolerated in women with PAH. Despite the approval of numerous therapies 
for PAH in recent years, pregnancy avoidance or early termination is still 
recommended in women with PAH because of poor outcomes. In this review, we will 
discuss physiologic and hormonal changes in pregnancy as they relate to 
pulmonary vascular disease and right heart function. We will review current 
consensus recommendations and outline the management of pregnancy in PAH when it 
does occur.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer screening can decrease morbidity and mortality. 
However, there are widespread differences in the implementation of programmes 
and choice of strategy. The primary objective of this study was to estimate 
lifelong costs and health outcomes of two of the currently most preferred 
methods of screening for colorectal cancer: colonoscopy and sensitive faecal 
immunochemical test (FIT).
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of colorectal cancer screening in a 
Swedish population was performed using a decision analysis model, based on the 
design of the Screening of Swedish Colons (SCREESCO) study, and data from the 
published literature and registries. Lifelong cost and effects of colonoscopy 
once, colonoscopy every 10 years, FIT twice, FIT biennially and no screening 
were estimated using simulations.
RESULTS: For 1000 individuals invited to screening, it was estimated that 
screening once with colonoscopy yielded 49 more quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and a cost saving of €64 800 compared with no screening. Similarly, 
screening twice with FIT gave 26 more QALYs and a cost saving of €17 600. When 
the colonoscopic screening was repeated every tenth year, 7 additional QALYs 
were gained at a cost of €189 400 compared with a single colonoscopy. The 
additional gain with biennial FIT screening was 25 QALYs at a cost of €154 300 
compared with two FITs.
CONCLUSION: All screening strategies were cost-effective compared with no 
screening. Repeated and single screening strategies with colonoscopy were more 
cost-effective than FIT when lifelong effects and costs were considered. 
However, other factors such as patient acceptability of the test and 
availability of human resources also have to be taken into account.

Evolution of human lifespan: Past, future, and present.

Irvine, California.

The only satisfactory general theory for understanding the biology of aging is 
that provided by evolutionary genetics. The central theoretical result of the 
evolutionary theory of aging is that aging is caused by a fall in the force of 
natural selection, beginning at the time of the onset of reproduction and 
continuing until the cessation of reproduction. This formal result has been 
tested using breeding experiments in which the force of natural selection is 
altered in replicated laboratory populations. As predicted by the evolutionary 
theory of aging, such experiments can readily postpone aging. A recent advance 
has been the discovery of late-life mortality plateaus in human and other 
populations. These can be predicted theoretically from the late-life plateau in 
the force of natural selection, when it remains at or near zero. It is virtually 
certain that human lifespan has substantially increased over its last few 
million years of evolution. Evolutionary theory can explain this increase in 
terms of decreased ecological vulnerability resulting from increased brain size. 
The immediate future of human evolution is unlikely to see extensive genetic 
increases in lifespan, given the experimental data on rates of change in 
lifespan with experimental populations. But, evolutionary research suggests that 
there are few fundamental biological barriers to the extension of human 
lifespan, only practical barriers. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 10:409-420, 1998. © 1998

The label-free localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) detection technique 
has been identified as a powerful means for in situ investigation of biological 
processes and localized chemical reactions at single particle level with high 
spatial and temporal resolution. Herein, a core-satellites assembled 
nanostructure of Au50@Au13 was designed for in situ detection and intracellular 
imaging of telomerase activity by combining plasmonic resonance Rayleigh 
scattering spectroscopy with dark-field microscope (DFM). The Au50@Au13 was 
fabricated by using 50 nm gold nanoparticles (Au50) as core and 13 nm gold 
nanoparticles (Au13) as satellites, both of them were functionalized with single 
chain DNA and gathered proximity through the highly specific DNA hybridization 
with a nicked hairpin DNA (O1) containing a telomerase substrate (TS) primer as 
linker. In the presence of telomerase, the telomeric repeated sequence of 
(TTAGGG)n extended at the 3'-end of O1 would hybridized with its complementary 
sequences at 5'-ends. This led the telomerase extension product of O1 be folded 
to form a rigid hairpin structure. As a result, the Au50@Au13 was disassembled 
with the releasing of O1 and Au13-S from Au50-L, which dramatically decreased 
the plasmon coupling effect. The remarkable LSPR spectral shift was observed 
accompanied by a detectable color change from orange to green with the increase 
of telomerase activity at single particle level with a detection limit of 1.3 × 
10-13 IU. The ability of Au50@Au13 for in situ imaging intracellular telomerase 
activity, distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells, in situ monitoring the 
variation of cellular telomerase activity after treated with drugs were also

Optimizing Breast Cancer Adjuvant Radiation and Integration of Breast and 
Reconstructive Surgery.

Postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) reduces the risk of locoregional and distant 
recurrence and improves overall survival in women with lymph node-positive 
breast cancer. Because of stage migration and improvements in systemic therapy 
and other aspects of breast cancer care, the absolute benefit of PMRT and 
regional nodal irradiation may be small in some favorable subsets of patients 
with very low nodal burden, and newer consensus guidelines do not mandate PMRT 
in all node-positive cases. The use and need for PMRT may considerably 
complicate breast reconstruction after mastectomy and therefore mandates 
multidisciplinary input that takes into account patient choice given potential 
risk of acute and long-term toxicities, benefits, life expectancy, the biology 
of the tumor, plans for systemic therapy, and actual tumor burden. Management of 
axillary lymph node metastases is changing with selective use of axillary lymph 
node dissection for advanced disease, sentinel lymph node biopsy alone for 
clinically and pathologic node-negative cases receiving mastectomy, and targeted 
axillary dissection alone among patients with eradication of initial 
biopsy-proven nodal metastases with neoadjuvant systemic therapy use. In 
general, when the need for PMRT is anticipated, autologous reconstruction should 
be delayed. This comprehensive article reviews the current indications and 
implications regarding integration of breast cancer surgery and timing of 
reconstruction with optimum radiation delivery to achieve the best possible 
patient outcomes.

The prognosis of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has improved so 
that life expectancy for patients responding to tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) is now equivalent to age-matched controls. Attention should be paid to 
comorbidities that impact survival. The success of TKI therapy can be easily and 
reliably assessed at well-accepted time points using quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) standardized to the international scale. Patient-reported 
outcome (PRO) tools are readily available for use in the clinic and provide 
complementary information on the tolerance of TKIs. Effectively managing adverse 
events of TKIs can improve compliance and quality of life. Discontinuation of 
TKIs is the next frontier in CML. In select patients with sustained deep 
molecular remission, a discontinuation of TKI is associated with a durable 
treatment-free remission in approximately 50%. Patient engagement in their 
discontinuation can be achieved through a provider multi-team coaching, is 
complementary to the available guidelines, and may provide an additional safety 
net so that these discontinuations remain safe when applied in general 
practices.

After the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) the life expectancy of 
patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is now approaching 
that of the general population and the importance of non-AIDS co-morbidities is 
increasing. Specifically, the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) seems to be 
higher in HIV-infected patients and an accurate risk prediction of CAD is of 
high importance for optimal long term treatment. In this study, we assessed the 
correlation of the endoPAT, which is an office-based CVD screening tool with the 
myocardial perfusion reserve by 82-rubidium PET/CT. We measured the reactive 
hyperemia index, which is a measure of the endothelial responsiveness, by the 
use of an endoPAT device (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel) in 48 ART treated 
HIV-infected patients with high CD 4 cell counts and viral suppression (HIV-RNA 
< 20 copies/mL), who had previously undergone measurement of the myocardial 
perfusion reserve by 82-rubidium PET/CT for study purposes. We found an inverse 
correlation between the reactive hyperemia index and the myocardial perfusion 
reserve which most likely indicates different vascular physiology. This study 
did not find evidence to suggest the immediate implementation of the reactive 
hyperemia index as a screening tool for early coronary artery disease in 
well-treated HIV-infected patients pending further validation in larger 
prospective studies.

Modeling the Transmission of Measles and Rubella to Support Global Management 
Policy Analyses and Eradication Investment Cases.

Policy makers responsible for managing measles and rubella immunization programs 
currently use a wide range of different vaccines formulations and immunization 
schedules. With endemic measles and rubella transmission interrupted in the 
region of the Americas, all five other regions of the World Health Organization 
(WHO) targeting the elimination of measles transmission by 2020, and increasing 
adoption of rubella vaccine globally, integrated dynamic disease, risk, 
decision, and economic models can help national, regional, and global health 
leaders manage measles and rubella population immunity. Despite hundreds of 
publications describing models for measles or rubella and decades of use of 
vaccines that contain both antigens (e.g., measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine 
or MMR), no transmission models for measles and rubella exist to support global 
policy analyses. We describe the development of a dynamic disease model for 
measles and rubella transmission, which we apply to 180 WHO member states and 
three other areas (Puerto Rico, Hong Kong, and Macao) representing >99.5% of the 
global population in 2013. The model accounts for seasonality, age-heterogeneous 
mixing, and the potential existence of preferentially mixing undervaccinated 
subpopulations, which create heterogeneity in immunization coverage that impacts 
transmission. Using our transmission model with the best available information 
about routine, supplemental, and outbreak response immunization, we characterize 
the complex transmission dynamics for measles and rubella historically to 
compare the results with available incidence and serological data. We show the 
results from several countries that represent diverse epidemiological situations 
to demonstrate the performance of the model. The model suggests relatively high 
measles and rubella control costs of approximately $3 billion annually for 
vaccination based on 2013 estimates, but still leads to approximately 17 million 
disability-adjusted life years lost with associated costs for treatment, home 
care, and productivity loss costs of approximately $4, $3, and $47 billion 
annually, respectively. Combined with vaccination and other financial cost 
estimates, our estimates imply that the eradication of measles and rubella could 
save at least $10 billion per year, even without considering the benefits of 
preventing lost productivity and potential savings from reductions in 
vaccination. The model should provide a useful tool for exploring the health and 
economic outcomes of prospective opportunities to manage measles and rubella. 
Improving the quality of data available to support decision making and modeling 
should represent a priority as countries work toward measles and rubella goals.

BACKGROUND: Despite major advances in prevention and treatment, coronary artery 
disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Whereas many sources 
of data are available on the epidemiology of acute coronary syndromes, fewer 
datasets reflect the contemporary management and outcomes of stable CAD 
patients.
HYPOTHESIS: A worldwide contemporary registry would improve our knowledge about 
stable CAD. The main objectives are to describe the demographics, clinical 
profile, contemporary management and outcomes of outpatients with stable CAD; to 
identify gaps between evidence and treatment; and to investigate long-term 
prognostic determinants.
METHODS: CLARIFY (ProspeCtive observational LongitudinAl RegIstry oF patients 
with stable coronary arterY disease) is an ongoing international observational 
longitudinal registry. Stable CAD patients from 45 countries in Europe, Asia, 
America, Middle East, Australia and Africa were enrolled between November 2009 
and June 2010. The inclusion criteria were previous myocardial infarction, 
evidence of coronary stenosis >50%, proven symptomatic myocardial ischemia or 
prior revascularization procedure. The main exclusion criteria were serious 
non-cardiovascular disease, conditions interfering with life expectancy or 
severe other cardiovascular disease (including advanced heart failure). 
Follow-up visits were planned annually for up to 5 years, interspersed with 
6-month telephone calls.
RESULTS: Of the 32,703 patients enrolled, most (77.6%) were male, age (mean ± 
SD) was 64.2 ± 10.5 years, and 71.0% were receiving treatment for hypertension; 
mean ± SD resting heart rate was 68.2 ± 10.6 bpm. Patients were enrolled based 
on a history of myocardial infarction >3 months earlier (57.7%), having at least 
one stenosis >50% on coronary angiography (61.1%), proven symptomatic myocardial 
ischemia on non-invasive testing (23.1%), or history of percutaneous coronary 
intervention or coronary artery bypass graft (69.8%). Baseline characteristics 
were similar across the four subgroups identified by the four inclusion 
criteria.
CONCLUSION: CLARIFY will provide a useful resource for understanding the current 
epidemiology of stable CAD.

A systematic literature review of methods of incorporating mortality in 
cost-effectiveness analyses of lipid-lowering therapies.

AIMS: Cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a useful tool for estimating the 
value of an intervention in relation to alternatives. In cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), CEA is especially important, given the high economic and clinical burden. 
One key driver of value is CVD mortality prevention. However, data used to 
inform CEA parameters can be limited, given the difficulty in demonstrating 
statistically significant mortality benefit in randomized clinical trials 
(RCTs), due in part to the frequency of fatal events and limited trial 
durations. This systematic review identifies and summarizes whether published 
CVD-related CEAs have incorporated mortality benefits, and the methodology among 
those that did.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted of CEAs of 
lipid-lowering therapies published between 2000-2017. Health technology 
assessments (HTA) and full-length manuscripts were included, and sources of 
mortality data and methods of applying mortality benefits were extracted. 
Results were summarized as proportions of articles to articulate common 
practices in CEAs of CVD.
RESULTS: This review identified 100 studies for inclusion, comprising 93 
full-length manuscripts and seven HTA reviews. Among these, 99% assumed a 
mortality benefit in the model. However, 87 of these studies that incorporated 
mortality differences did so despite the trials used to inform model parameters 
not demonstrating statistically significant differences in mortality. None of 
the 12 studies that used statistically significant findings from an individual 
RCT were based on active control studies. In a sub-group analysis considering 
the 60 CEAs that incorporated a direct mortality benefit, 48 (80%) did not have 
RCT evidence for statistically significant benefit in CVD mortality.
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The finding that few CEA models included mortality 
inputs from individual RCTs of lipid-lowering therapy may be surprising, as one 
might expect that treatment efficacy should be based on robust clinical 
evidence. However, regulatory requirements in CVD-related RCTs often lead to 
insufficient sample sizes and observation periods for detecting a difference in 
CVD mortality, which results in the use of intermediate outcomes, composite 
end-points, or meta-analysis to extrapolate long-term mortality benefit in a 
lifetime CEA.

The protein kinase MBK-1 contributes to lifespan extension in daf-2 mutant and 
germline-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, reduction of insulin/IGF-1 like signaling and loss of 
germline stem cells both increase lifespan by activating the conserved 
transcription factor DAF-16 (FOXO). While the mechanisms that regulate DAF-16 
nuclear localization in response to insulin/IGF-1 like signaling are well 
characterized, the molecular pathways that act in parallel to regulate DAF-16 
transcriptional activity, and the pathways that couple DAF-16 activity to 
germline status, are not fully understood at present. Here, we report that 
inactivation of MBK-1, the C. elegans ortholog of the human FOXO1-kinase DYRK1A 
substantially shortens the prolonged lifespan of daf-2 and glp-1 mutant animals 
while decreasing wild-type lifespan to a lesser extent. On the other hand, 
lifespan-reduction by mutation of the MBK-1-related kinase HPK-1 was not 
preferential for long-lived mutants. Interestingly, mbk-1 loss still allowed for 
DAF-16 nuclear accumulation but reduced expression of certain DAF-16 target 
genes in germline-less, but not in daf-2 mutant animals. These findings indicate 
that mbk-1 and daf-16 functionally interact in the germline- but not in the 
daf-2 pathway. Together, our data suggest mbk-1 as a novel regulator of C. 
elegans longevity upon both, germline ablation and DAF-2 inhibition, and provide 
evidence for mbk-1 regulating DAF-16 activity in germline-deficient animals.

University of Milan, Milan, Italy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In numerous neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), respiratory 
muscle weakness is present, and acute or chronic respiratory failure may evolve. 
Very often, respiratory involvement substantially adds to the burden of disease, 
impairs quality of life, or reduces life expectancy. This article summarizes new 
aspects of both diagnosis and management of respiratory muscle weakness in 
patients with NMDs.
RECENT FINDINGS: Drugs like deflazacort, ataluren, eteplirsen, and nusinersen 
are now approved treatments for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Spinal Muscular 
Atrophy, and others are on their way in NMDs. Although observing how innovative 
drugs will change the natural history of these diseases, including respiratory 
function over time, adequate symptomatic treatment remains meaningful and is 
strongly recommended. Physicians should systematically take respiratory 
involvement into account to improve patients' quality of life and prognosis.
SUMMARY: First, it is outlined in which subtypes of NMD respiratory muscle 
dysfunction is particularly relevant. Second, new developments regarding 
diagnostic procedures, including respiratory muscle strength testing, 
spirometry, and sleep studies, are covered. Third, this article gives an 
overview on current concepts of ventilatory support and management of secretions 
in patients with NMD.

RATIONALE: Exogenous lipoid pneumonia is a rare condition due to abnormal 
presence of oily substances in the lungs. It is a rarely known cause for false 
positive FDG PET-CT results and can sometimes lead to invasive investigations. 
Searching and finding the source of the oily substance is one of the keys to the 
diagnosis. Inhalation of oily drugs during snorting has rarely been described.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A patient with well controlled HIV infection was referred for 
an FDG PET-CT to assess extension of Kaposi's disease, recently removed from his 
right foot. The patient had no particular symptoms.
DIAGNOSES: Abnormal uptake of FDG was found in a suspicious lung nodule. An 
experienced radiologist thought the nodule was due to lipoid pneumonia.
INTERVENTIONS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid did not contain lipid-laden 
macrophages but bronchoscopy showed violet lesions resembling Kaposi's disease 
lesions. Lobectomy was performed after a multidisciplinary discussion.
OUTCOMES: Anatomopathological analysis revealed the nodule was due to lipoid 
pneumonia. The patient's quality of life did not diminish after the operation 
and he is still in good health. The source of the oily substance causing lipoid 
pneumonia was found after the surgery: the patient used to snort oily drugs.
LESSONS: The presence of a suspicious lung nodule possibly due to lipoid 
pneumonia in a patient with known Kaposi's disease was difficult to untangle and 
lead to invasive surgery. It is possible that if a source of exogenous lipoid 
pneumonia had been found beforehand, surgery could have been prevented.

POLLEN APERTURE POLYMORPHISM AND GAMETOPHYTE PERFORMANCE IN VIOLA DIVERSIFOLIA.

Pollen aperture polymorphism is studied in Viola diversifolia, where all plants 
produce three- and four-apertured pollen grains. We tested whether there are 
genetic differences among plants for the proportions of the different pollen 
morphs, and whether the morphs differ in gametophytic performance. Results show 
that the more apertures a pollen grain has, the more quickly it germinates but 
that few-apertured pollen grains have faster growing pollen tubes and longer 
life expectancies. The proportions of the different pollen morphs, together with 
pollen tube growth rates, may be inherited traits based on differences among 
maternal families. These results suggest that the different pollen morphs are 
favored in different pollination ecology situations. The production of several 
pollen morphs by the same individual could therefore be evolutionarily 
advantageous.
