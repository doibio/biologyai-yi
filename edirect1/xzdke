BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the impact of 3 anticonvulsant prophylaxis 
strategies on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) among patients with an 
incident acute ischemic stroke.
METHODS: We created a decision tree to evaluate 3 strategies: (1) long-term 
primary prophylaxis; (2) short-term secondary prophylaxis after an early seizure 
with lifetime prophylaxis if persistent or late seizures (LSs) developed; and 
(3) long-term secondary prophylaxis if either early, late, or persistent 
seizures developed. The outcome was quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY). We 
created 4 base cases to simulate common clinical scenarios: (1) female patient 
aged 40 years with a 2% or 11% lifetime risk of an LS and a 33% lifetime risk of 
an adverse drug reaction (ADR); (2) male patient aged 65 years with a 6% or 29% 
LS risk and 60% ADR risk; (3) male patient aged 50 years with an 18% or 65% LS 
risk and 33% ADR risk; and (4) female patient aged 80 years with a 29% or 83% LS 
risk and 80% ADR risk. In sensitivity analyses, we altered the parameters and 
assumptions.
RESULTS: Across all 4 base cases, primary prophylaxis yielded the fewest QALYs 
when compared with secondary prophylaxis. For example, under scenario 1, 
strategies 2 and 3 resulted in 7.17 QALYs each, but strategy 1 yielded only 6.91 
QALYs. Under scenario 4, strategies 2 and 3 yielded 2.85 QALYs compared with 
1.40 QALYs for strategy 1. Under scenarios in which patients had higher ADR 
risks, strategy 2 led to the most QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Short-term therapy with continued anticonvulsant prophylaxis only 
after postischemic stroke seizures arise dominates lifetime primary prophylaxis 
in all scenarios examined. Our findings reinforce the necessity of close 
follow-up and discontinuation of anticonvulsant seizure prophylaxis started 
during acute ischemic stroke hospitalization.

BACKGROUND: Rare diseases (RDs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that individually affect 
a small number of subjects but overall represent a major public health issue 
globally. There are still limited data on RD burden due to the paucity of large 
population-based epidemiological studies. The aim of this research was to 
provide survival estimates of patients with a RD residing in Tuscany, Italy.
METHODS: Cases collected in the Rare Diseases Registry of Tuscany with diagnosis 
between 1st January 2000 and 31th December 2018 were linked to the regional 
health databases in order to retrieve information on mortality of all subjects. 
Survival at 1, 5 and 10 years from diagnosis with 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
was estimated by sex, age class, nosological group and subgroup using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. The effect of sex, age and period of diagnosis (years 
2000-2009 or 2010-2018) on survival was estimated using Cox proportional hazards 
regression.
RESULTS: Survival at 1, 5 and 10 years from diagnosis was 97.3%, 88.8% and 
80.8%, respectively. Respiratory diseases and peripheral and central nervous 
system disorders were characterized by the lowest survival at 5 and 10 years. 
Despite a modest higher prevalence of RDs among females (54.0% of the total), 
male cases had a significant increased risk of death (hazard ratio, HR 1.48, 95% 
CI 1.38-1.58). Cases diagnosed during 2010-2018 period had a risk of death 
significantly lower than those diagnosed during 2000-2009 (HR 0.81, 95% CI 
0.82-0.96), especially for immune system disorders (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26-0.87), 
circulatory system diseases (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.84) and diseases of the 
musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: An earlier diagnosis as well as the improvement in the efficacy of 
treatment resulted in a decreased risk of death over the years for specific RDs. 
The linkage between a population-based registry and other regional databases 
exploited in this study provides a large and accurate mass of data capable of 
estimating patients' life-expectancy and increasing knowledge on the collective 
burden of RDs.

THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES: The complexity of pediatric healthcare has increased due 
to advancement in research and identification of new treatment modalities. With 
these advancements, life expectancy has increased creating a greater need for 
young adult transition into adult medical settings and specialty care (Marani et 
al., 2020). The holistic approach of nursing care is essential in assisting 
young adults during this transitional period.
PHENOMENON ADDRESSED: Many pediatric hospitals and subspecialties continue to 
care for young adults ≥18 years of age that have not transitioned to adult care. 
In the perioperative care coordination clinic at Boston Children's Hospital, 
pediatric nurses and advanced practice nurse practitioners provide care to 
patients from infancy to adulthood, throughout many specialties, to ensure safe 
perioperative care for a medically complex surgical population. The purpose of 
this paper is to describe the PCCC young adult care coordination process that 
provides engaging opportunities for the young adult to advocate for oneself and 
promote autonomy as they proceed through the stages of transition to adult care.
RESEARCH LINKAGES: The perioperative care coordination process at Boston 
Children's Hospital aligns with the Society of Pediatric Nurses position 
statement that recommended pediatric nurses utilize a framework (Betz, 2017) and 
Meleis' middle-range theory of Transitions that identified the nursing role 
during the transitional process (Meleis et al., 2000). A suggestion for future 
nursing research includes development of a nursing framework that nurses can 
utilize when supporting young adults during their progression through the steps 
of transition from pediatric to adult perioperative programs.

OBJECTIVE: Short- and long-term glycemic variability are risk factors for 
diabetes complications. However, there are no validated A1C target ranges or 
measures of A1C stability in older adults. We evaluated the association of a 
patient-specific A1C variability measure, A1C time in range (A1C TIR), on major 
adverse outcomes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study 
using administrative data from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare 
from 2004 to 2016. Patients were ≥65 years old, had diabetes, and had at least 
four A1C tests during a 3-year baseline period. A1C TIR was the percentage of 
days during the baseline in which A1C was in an individualized target range 
(6.0-7.0% up to 8.0-9.0%) on the basis of clinical characteristics and predicted 
life expectancy. Increasing A1C TIR was divided into categories of 20% 
increments and linked to mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (i.e., 
myocardial infarction, stroke).
RESULTS: The study included 402,043 veterans (mean [SD] age 76.9 [5.7] years, 
98.8% male). During an average of 5.5 years of follow-up, A1C TIR had a graded 
relationship with mortality and CVD. Cox proportional hazards models showed that 
lower A1C TIR was associated with increased mortality (A1C TIR 0 to <20%: hazard 
ratio [HR] 1.22 [95% CI 1.20-1.25]) and CVD (A1C TIR 0 to <20%: HR 1.14 [95% CI 
1.11-1.19]) compared with A1C TIR 80-100%. Competing risk models and shorter 
follow-up (e.g., 24 months) showed similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with diabetes, maintaining A1C levels within 
individualized target ranges is associated with lower risk of mortality and CVD.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of 
demoralization in a sample of end-of-life cancer patients' family caregivers and 
investigate the association between demoralization and different factors, such 
as distress, hope, quality of life, and caregiver burden.
METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design and 142 participants were 
sampled. Family caregivers were included if they were caring for a cancer 
patient in palliative care with a limited life expectancy.Socio-demographic data 
were gathered, and Italian versions of the following scales were administered: 
Demoralization Scale (DS), Herth Hope Index (HHI), Caregiver Reaction Assessment 
(CRA), Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), and Distress Thermometer (DT).
RESULTS: The average total demoralization score was 29.04 (SD = 13.62). 19.50% 
of caregivers was the low scorers at DS (0-25th percentile), 27.50% was the 
middle scorers (25th-75th percentile), and 39.00% was the high scorers (75th-100 
percentile). 19.50% of the caregivers showed mild demoralization, 27.50% 
moderate demoralization, and 39.00% showed severe demoralization. Strong 
Moderate correlations were found between the total DS score and the Temporality 
and Future HHI subscale (ρ = .520); the HHI total score (ρ = .528); the Social 
functioning (ρ = .536) and Mental health (ρ = .675) SF-36 subscales. The HHI 
total score and the Mental health SF-36 subscale emerged as the main predictors 
of demoralization.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that not only end-of-life patients but also family 
caregivers may experience demoralization. This demoralization seems to be more 
associated to spiritual and psychological suffering rather than difficulties 
relating to caregivers' personal time, social roles, physical states, and 
financial resources.

Background Guidelines such as the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System 
(Lung-RADS) are available for determining when subsolid nodules should be 
treated within lung cancer screening programs, but they are based on expert 
opinion. Purpose To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of varying treatment 
thresholds for subsolid nodules within a lung cancer screening setting by using 
a simulation model. Materials and Methods A previously developed model simulated 
10 million current and former smokers undergoing CT lung cancer screening who 
were assumed to have a ground-glass nodule (GGN) at baseline. Nodules were 
allowed to grow and to develop solid components over time according to a monthly 
cycle and lifetime horizon. Management strategies generated by varying treatment 
thresholds, including the solid component size and use of the Brock risk 
calculator, were tested. For each strategy, average U.S. costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient were computed, and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of those on the efficient frontier 
were calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of results were 
performed by varying several relevant parameters, such as treatment costs or 
malignancy growth rates. Results Variants of the Lung-RADS guidelines that did 
not treat pure GGNs were cost-effective. Strategies based on the Brock risk 
calculator did not reach the efficient frontier. The strategy with the highest 
QALYs under a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY included no 
treatment of GGNs and a threshold of 4-mm solid component size for treatment of 
subsolid nodules. This strategy yielded an ICER of $52 993 per QALY (95% CI: 
44 407, 64 372). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed this was the optimal 
strategy under a range of parameter variations. Conclusion Treatment of pure 
ground-glass nodules was not cost-effective. Strategies that use modifications 
of the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System guidelines were 
cost-effective for treating part-solid nodules; an optimal threshold of 4 mm for 
the solid component yielded the most quality-adjusted life years. © RSNA, 2021

Targeting androgen receptor signaling: a historical perspective.

The first case of prostate cancer was identified by histological examination by 
Adams, a surgeon at The London Hospital, in 1853. In his report, Adams noted 
that the condition was 'a very rare disease'. Now, over 150 years later, with 
increased life expectancy and screening, prostate cancer has become one of the 
most common cancers in men. In the United States alone, nearly 200,000 men are 
diagnosed with prostate cancer annually and about 33,000 succumb to their 
disease. Fifty years ago, men were typically diagnosed with prostate cancer in 
their seventies with disease that had metastasized to the bone and/or soft 
tissue. Diagnosis at such an advanced stage was a death sentence, with patients 
dying within 2 years. The pioneering work of Charles Huggins in the 1940s found 
that metastatic prostate cancer responds to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), 
ushering in the rational use of hormone therapies that have irrevocably changed 
the course of prostate cancer disease management. Medical castration was the 
first effective systemic targeted therapy for any cancer and, to this day, 
androgen ablation remains the mainstay of prostate cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Adjuvant therapy for stage III melanoma improves several measures of 
patient survival. However, decisions regarding inclusion of adjuvant therapies 
in the formularies of public payers necessarily consider the cost-effectiveness 
of those treatments. The objective of this study is to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of four recently approved adjuvant therapies for BRAF-mutant 
stage III melanoma in the Medicare patient population.
METHODS: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a Markov microsimulation model was 
used to simulate the healthcare trajectory of patients randomized to receive 
either first-line targeted therapy (dabrafenib-trametinib) or immunotherapy 
(ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab). The base case was a 65-year-old 
Medicare patient with BRAF V600E-mutant resected stage III melanoma. Possible 
health states included recurrence-free survival, adverse events, local 
recurrence, distant metastases, and death. Transition probabilities were 
determined from published clinical trials. Costs were estimated from 
reimbursement rates reported by CMS and the Red Book drug price database. 
Primary outcomes were costs (US$), life years, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Model robustness was 
evaluated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Dabrafenib-trametinib provided 1.83 QALYs over no treatment and 0.23 
QALYs over the most effective immunotherapy, pembrolizumab. 
Dabrafenib-trametinib was associated with an ICER of $95,758/QALY over no 
treatment and $285,863/QALY over pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab yielded an ICER of 
$68,396/QALY over no treatment and dominated other immunotherapies.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab is cost-effective at a conventional 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold, but dabrafenib-trametinib is not. Though 
dabrafenib-trametinib offers incremental QALYs, optimization of drug pricing is 
necessary to ensure dabrafenib-trametinib is accessible at an acceptable WTP 
threshold.

Mathematical modeling of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2-Evaluating the impact of 
isolation in São Paulo State (Brazil) and lockdown in Spain associated with 
protective measures on the epidemic of CoViD-19.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19), with the fatality rate in elder (60 years 
old or more) being much higher than young (60 years old or less) patients, was 
declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. A 
mathematical model considering young and elder subpopulations under different 
fatality rates was formulated based on the natural history of CoViD-19 to study 
the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2). The model considered susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, 
pre-symptomatic, mild CoViD-19, severe CoViD-19, and recovered compartments, 
besides compartments of isolated individuals and those who were caught by test. 
This model was applied to study the epidemiological scenario resulting from the 
adoption of quarantine (isolation or lockdown) in many countries to control the 
rapid propagation of CoViD-19. We chose as examples the isolation adopted in São 
Paulo State (Brazil) in the early phase but not at the beginning of the 
epidemic, and the lockdown implemented in Spain when the number of severe 
CoViD-19 cases was increasing rapidly. Based on the data collected from São 
Paulo State and Spain, the model parameters were evaluated, and we obtained a 
higher estimation for the basic reproduction number R0 (9.24 for São Paulo 
State, and 8 for Spain) compared to the currently accepted estimation of R0 
around 2 using the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered 
compartments) model. In comparison with the lockdown in Spain, the relatively 
early adoption of the isolation in São Paulo State resulted in enlarging the 
period of the first wave of the epidemic and delaying its peak. The model 
allowed to explain the flattening of the epidemic curves by quarantine when 
associated with the protective measures (face mask, washing hands with alcohol 
and gel, and social distancing) adopted by the population. The description of 
the epidemic under quarantine and protections can be a background to foreseen 
the epidemiological scenarios from the release strategies, which can help guide 
public health policies by decision-makers.

Ireland.

OBJECTIVES: Globally, increasing life expectancy has escalated demands on 
psychiatric services caring for a later life population. It is recognised that 
those with enduring mental illness may have specific needs with advancing age. 
In this study, we describe the characteristics of a population aged over 60 
years attending a general adult community psychiatric service and compare 
demographic and clinical features across age and diagnostic categories. The 
study aims to gather preliminary information which may guide future local mental 
health service planning.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using retrospective 
chart review of all patients aged over 60 years attending four community mental 
health teams in North Dublin. Cohorts of attenders were stratified by age 
comparing 60-64 year age group with the population aged 65 years and over. 
Attenders were also stratified by diagnosis and regression analysis was used to 
determine predictors of psychotic disorder diagnosis.
RESULTS: The study included 127 patients. There was a higher prevalence of 
psychotic disorders among those aged 65 years and over (n = 73), while those 
aged 60-64 years (n = 54) were more likely to have depression and non-affective, 
non-psychotic disorders. Among the population aged 65 years and over 78% (n = 
57) were long-term psychiatric service attenders.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the sample aged 65 years and over were long-term 
service attenders with a diagnosis of severe mental illness. Further research is 
warranted to determine optimal service delivery for later life psychiatric 
service attenders.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy has risen, leading to an increase in acetabular 
fractures in fragile patients. Total hip arthroplasty with a reinforcement cage 
is a technically complex option, but allows fracture control and early 
mobilization. Our aim is to assess whether the use of Burch-Schneider cage in 
fragile patients with acetabular fractures allows immediate load stabilization 
without threatening the early survival of the arthroplasty.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive study of a series of 14 patients with 
acetabular fractures treated by a reinforcement cage associated with autologous 
bonegraft plus a cemented acetabular cup, and mobilization and bearing. Judet 
Letournel fracture types, surgical delay, and complications during admission 
were analyzed. Following hospital discharge we recorded the incorporation of 
grafts according to Gie's classification, presence of calcifications according 
to Brooker, consolidation of the fracture, loosening of implants and functional 
aspects according to the HHS and Merlé D'Aubigné Postel score.
RESULTS: The most common fracture was both columns (6/14), with a surgical delay 
being of 11 days mean and 21,5 days of length of stay. One patient died after 
surgery. The mean follow-up was 34.4 months. All fractures healed and the 
bonegraft was incorporated in all cases. The mean HHS was 82 points and the 
Merle Score was 15/18. There were no complications related to arthroplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: Total hip arthroplasty with Burch-Schneider cage on bonegraft and 
no added osteosynthesis is a good option of treatment of all types of displaced 
acetabular fractures in a fragile patient.

INTRODUCTION: Minimally invasive tests for Barrett's esophagus (BE) detection 
have raised the prospect of broader nonreflux-based testing. Cost-effectiveness 
studies have largely studied men aged 50 years with chronic gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. We evaluated the comparative cost effectiveness 
of BE screening tests in GERD-based and GERD-independent testing scenarios.
METHODS: Markov modeling was performed in 3 scenarios in 50 years old 
individuals: (i) White men with chronic GERD (GERD-based); (ii) GERD-independent 
(all races, men and women), BE prevalence 1.6%; and (iii) GERD-independent, BE 
prevalence 5%. The simulation compared multiple screening strategies with no 
screening: sedated endoscopy (sEGD), transnasal endoscopy, swallowable 
esophageal cell collection devices with biomarkers, and exhaled volatile organic 
compounds. A hypothetical cohort of 500,000 individuals followed for 40 years 
using a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) was simulated. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) comparing 
each strategy with no screening and comparing screening strategies with each 
other were calculated.
RESULTS: In both GERD-independent scenarios, most non-sEGD BE screening tests 
were cost effective. Swallowable esophageal cell collection devices with 
biomarkers were cost effective (<$35,000/QALY) and were the optimal screening 
tests in all scenarios. Exhaled volatile organic compounds had the highest ICERs 
in all scenarios. ICERs were low (<$25,000/QALY) for all tests in the GERD-based 
scenario, and all non-sEGD tests dominated no screening. ICERs were sensitive to 
BE prevalence and test costs.
DISCUSSION: Minimally invasive nonendoscopic tests may make GERD-independent BE 
screening cost effective. Participation rates for these strategies need to be 
studied.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the trend of paediatric visual impairment and its 
disparities by year, sex, age and national socioeconomic levels using 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
METHODS: It is a retrospective analysis of data from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) 2017. Global and national DALY numbers and rates of vision 
impairment in three paediatric age groups of 1-4 (preschool children), 5-9 
(school children) and 10-14 years (teenagers) years were obtained from the GBD 
2017 database. The socioeconomic indices for 195 countries were derived from 
international open databases. Main outcome measures were comparison of DALYs due 
to paediatric vision impairment in different age groups by socioeconomic 
indicators in 2017 and analysis of the trend from 1990.
RESULTS: The global prevalence of distance and/or near vision impairment for 
1-14 years was 2.8% (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 2.5-3.1) in 2017. The 
highest DALYs for distance and/or near vision impairment [number=589.93 
thousands (95%UI: 367.71-933.29), rate = 92.72 (95%UI: 57.79-146.68)] were 
observed in teenagers. DALY rate of distance and/or near vision impairment was 
not associated with socioeconomic indicators, however, DALY rate of refractive 
disorders had positive correlation with national socioeconomic development. The 
global trends of DALY numbers in distance and/or near vision impairment as well 
as refractive and other causes remained stable from 1990 to 2015 
(0.128 ≤ P ≤ 0.738), however, DALY rates had a statistically significant trend 
of reduction in all paediatric age groups (0.003 ≤ P ≤ 0.024).
CONCLUSION: The global health burden of paediatric vision impairment decreased 
from 1990. Refractive, near vision impairment and other causes were associated 
with socioeconomic development.

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a 
public health emergency of global concern. Accordingly, the demand for personal 
protective equipment (PPE), including medical face masks, has sharply risen 
compared with 2019. The new situation has led to a sharp increase in energy 
demand and the environmental impacts associated with these product systems. 
Hence, the pandemic's effects on the environmental consequences of various PPE 
types, such as medical face masks, should be assessed. In light of that, the 
current study aimed to identify the environmental hot-spots of medical face mask 
production and consumption by using life cycle assessment (LCA) and tried to 
provide solutions to mitigate the adverse impacts. Based on the results 
obtained, in 2020, medical face masks production using fossil-based plastics 
causes the loss of 2.03 × 103 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs); 1.63 × 108 
PDF*m2*yr damage to ecosystem quality; the climate-damaging release of 
2.13 × 109 kg CO2eq; and 5.65 × 1010 MJ damage to resources. Besides, annual 
medical face mask production results in 5.88 × 104 TJ demand for exergy. On the 
other hand, if used makes are not appropriately handled, they can lead to 
4.99 × 105 Pt/yr additional damage to the environment in 2020 as determined by 
the EDIP 2003. Replacement of fossil-based plastics with bio-based plastics, at 
rates ranging from 10 to 100%, could mitigate the product's total yearly 
environmental damage by 4-43%, respectively. Our study calls attention to the 
environmental sustainability of PPE used to prevent virus transmission in the 
current and future pandemics.

Nanoformulation Approaches.

Sagar S(1), Singh D(1), Gupta GD(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Pharmaceutics, ISF College of Pharmacy, Moga, Punjab, India.

Aim/Objectives: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of joints 
affecting over 7% of the world population, especially females, contributing to 
2% of years lived with disability (YLD's) globally due to pain and impaired 
movement of limbs viz. hip, shoulder, and knee joint. The present review 
explores the nano-formulation approaches to improve the therapeutic efficacy of 
drugs for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Results and Discussion: The high 
treatment cost of osteoarthritis not only includes medication but also 
physiotherapy, adaptive aids, and devices or even surgery that further amounts 
to the loss of work hours. These medications are only treated symptomatically. 
Various nanocarriers have created interest of reasearchers in improving the 
bioavailability of active drugs, thereby, therapeutically improving the action 
and possible reduction of dose and side effects. Various nanocarriers are 
available viz. liposome, noisome, transferosome, hydrogel, microemulsion, and 
nanoparticle formulations for intraarticular, topical, and oral delivery for 
osteoarthritis treatment. Methods and Conclusion: This article focuses on novel 
approaches, such as lipid-based formulations and nano- or microparticles as 
treatment strategies to minimize side effects by using carriers viz. liposome, 
noisome, transferosome, hydrogel, microemulsion, and nanoparticle formulations 
for intraarticular, topical, and even oral delivery.

Ovarian cancer represents one of the most aggressive female tumors worldwide. 
Over the decades, the therapeutic options for the treatment of ovarian cancer 
have been improved significantly through the advancement of surgical techniques 
as well as the availability of novel effective drugs able to extend the life 
expectancy of patients. However, due to its clinical, biological and molecular 
complexity, ovarian cancer is still considered one of the most difficult tumors 
to manage. In this context, several studies have highlighted how a 
multidisciplinary approach to this pathology improves the prognosis and survival 
of patients with ovarian cancer. On these bases, the aim of the present review 
is to present recent advantages in the diagnosis, staging and treatment of 
ovarian cancer highlighting the benefits of a patient‑centered care approach and 
on the importance of a multidisciplinary team for the management of ovarian 
cancer.

The extent to which viral genomic RNAs interact with host factors and contribute 
to host response and disease pathogenesis is not well known. Here, we report 
that the human RNA helicase DDX6 specifically binds to the viral most conserved 
RNA hairpin in the A3 element in the dengue 3' UTR, with nanomolar affinities. 
DDX6 CLIP confirmed the interaction in HuH-7 cells infected by dengue virus 
serotype 2. This interaction requires three conserved residues-Lys307, Lys367, 
and Arg369-as well as the unstructured extension in the C-terminal domain of 
DDX6. Interestingly, alanine substitution of these three basic residues resulted 
in RNA-independent ATPase activity, suggesting a mechanism by which RNA-binding 
and ATPase activities are coupled in DEAD box helicases. Furthermore, we applied 
a cross-omics gene enrichment approach to suggest that DDX6 is functionally 
related to cell cycle regulation and viral pathogenicity. Indeed, infected cells 
exhibited cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and a decrease in the early S phase. 
Exogenous expression of intact DDX6, but not A3-binding-deficient mutants, 
alleviated these effects by rescue of the DNA preinitiation complex expression. 
Disruption of the DDX6-binding site was found in dengue and Zika live-attenuated 
vaccine strains. Our results suggested that dengue virus has evolved an RNA 
aptamer against DDX6 to alter host cell states and defined DDX6 as a new 
regulator of G1/S transition. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted by 
mosquitoes to humans, infecting 390 million individuals per year globally. About 
20% of infected patients shows a spectrum of clinical manifestation, ranging 
from a mild flu-like syndrome, to dengue fever, to life-threatening severe 
dengue diseases, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. 
There is currently no specific treatment for dengue diseases, and the molecular 
mechanism underlying dengue pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In this 
study, we combined biochemical, bioinformatics, high-content analysis and RNA 
sequencing approaches to characterize a highly conserved interface of the RNA 
genome of DENV with a human factor named DDX6 in infected cells. The 
significance of our research is in identifying the mechanism for a viral 
strategy to alter host cell fates, which conceivably allows us to generate a 
model for live-attenuated vaccine and the design of new therapeutic reagent for 
dengue diseases.

Comparison of Artificial Diets and Natural Prey for Mass Rearing of Orius 
strigicollis (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) Using Demographic Characteristics to 
Optimize Cost-Efficiency.

Orius strigicollis (Poppius) has been commonly released to control minute pests 
due to its remarkable foraging and predation ability. Despite decades long 
history of mass-rearing using eggs of Cadra cautella Walker (Lepidoptera: 
Pyralidae) as food, the cost of this food impeded the predator's marketing 
potential. Finding cost-effective artificial diets for mass rearing programs is, 
therefore, the key to promote the use of this generalist predator in practice. 
The aim of this study was to explore suitability of alternative diets for mass 
rearing of this predator, using the age-stage, two-sex life table. Eight recipes 
of artificial diets were initially screened, and the candidate diets were 
subsequently evaluated using the population parameters of O. strigicollis. The 
highest intrinsic rate of increase was found in the O. strigicollis fed on the 
meridic combined Diet 1, where nymphs and adults were fed different diets. 
However, the intensive period of oviposition by females reared on oligidic Diet 
O3 contributed to the shorter rearing period (42 d) and lower rearing cost than 
that on combined Diet 1 (60 d). Besides, with the harvest rate of 0.919, the 
minimal population size of 10,774 individuals with a stable age-stage 
distribution was needed for daily harvesting 1,000 third instars of O. 
strigicollis reared on Diet O3 at the rearing cost of 0.295 NTD (new Taiwanese 
dollar) per nymph. Thus, Diet O3 was determined to be the most cost-effective 
recipe for the mass-rearing of O. strigicollis among those used in this study.

Cost-Effectiveness of Vioptix versus Clinical Examination for Flap Monitoring of 
Autologous Free Tissue Breast Reconstruction.

University Wexner Medical Center; The Ohio State University College of Medicine; 
and the Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine.

BACKGROUND: Vioptix is a near-infrared spectroscopy tissue oximetry technology 
that allows for noninvasive monitoring of flap perfusion. Despite the reported 
benefits of Vioptix, the cost-effectiveness of this flap monitoring technology 
has not been compared to clinical examination alone.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model, from the patient perspective, was 
constructed with two treatment arms: clinical examination versus clinical 
examination combined with Vioptix for flap monitoring after autologous, free 
flap breast reconstruction. Costs, utilities, and other model inputs were 
identified from the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were performed. Gamma distributions were created for cost variables, and beta 
distributions were created for probability variables. An incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio under $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was 
considered cost-effective. All analyses were performed using TreeAge Pro 
(Williamstown, Mass.).
RESULTS: Mean cost of autologous free tissue transfer breast reconstruction with 
clinical examination-based flap monitoring was found to be $37,561 with an 
effectiveness of 0.79, whereas the mean cost of clinical examination with 
Vioptix for flap monitoring was $39,361 with effectiveness of 0.82. This yielded 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $60,507 for clinical examination 
combined with Vioptix for flap monitoring. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed 
that clinical examination with Vioptix became cost-effective when the cost of 
Vioptix was less than $1487. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that 
clinical examination was cost-effective in 86.5 percent of cases.
CONCLUSION: Although clinical examination combined with Vioptix is minimally 
more effective for flap monitoring after autologous, free flap breast 
reconstruction, clinical examination alone is the more cost-effective flap 
monitoring option.

A series of Cas9 variants have been developed to improve the editing fidelity or 
targeting range of CRISPR-Cas9. Here, we employ a high-throughput sequencing 
approach primer-extension-mediated sequencing to analyze the editing efficiency, 
specificity and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) compatibility of a dozen of 
SpCas9 variants at multiple target sites in depth, and our findings validate the 
high fidelity or broad editing range of these SpCas9 variants. With regard to 
the PAM-flexible SpCas9 variants, we detect significantly increased levels of 
off-target activity and propose a trade-off between targeting range and editing 
specificity for them, especially for the near-PAM-less SpRY. Moreover, we use a 
deep learning model to verify the consistency and predictability of SpRY 
off-target sites. Furthermore, we combine high-fidelity SpCas9 variants with 
SpRY to generate three new SpCas9 variants with both high fidelity and broad 
editing range. Finally, we also find that the existing SpCas9 variants are not 
effective in suppressing genome instability elicited by CRISPR-Cas9 editing,
