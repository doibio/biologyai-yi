reaction to having haemophilia.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that adherence is generally good, and that 
assessing illness and treatment beliefs, social support and outcome expectations 
may play a valuable role in identifying which individuals are at risk of 
non-adherence. Interventions aimed at improving adherence should particularly 
consider improving social support, reducing patients' concerns about 
prophylaxis, increasing their belief in the necessity of prophylaxis, and 
increasing positive outcome expectations.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is characterized by high rates 
of recurrence, resulting in substantial health care costs. The aim of this study 
was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of treatments for the management of second 
recurrence of community-onset CDI in France.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic simulation model to compare 5 
treatments for the management of second recurrence of community-onset CDI: 
pulsed-tapered vancomycin, fidaxomicin, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) 
via colonoscopy, FMT via duodenal infusion, and FMT via enema. The model outcome 
was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) among the 5 treatments. ICERs were interpreted 
using a willingness-to-pay threshold of €32,000/QALY. Uncertainty was evaluated 
through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Three strategies were on the efficiency frontier: pulsed-tapered 
vancomycin, FMT via enema, and FMT via colonoscopy, in order of increasing 
effectiveness. FMT via duodenal infusion and fidaxomicin were dominated (i.e. 
less effective and costlier) by FMT via colonoscopy and FMT via enema. FMT via 
enema compared with pulsed-tapered vancomycin had an ICER of €18,092/QALY. The 
ICER for FMT via colonoscopy versus FMT via enema was €73,653/QALY. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations showed 
that FMT via enema was the most cost-effective strategy in 58% of simulations 
and FMT via colonoscopy was favored in 19% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€32,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: FMT via enema is the most cost-effective initial strategy for the 
management of second recurrence of community-onset CDI at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €32,000/QALY.

OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus contributes to excessive cardiovascular deaths and 
reduced life expectancy in schizophrenia. This population-based cohort study 
investigated the endogenous risk for diabetes in antipsychotic-naive 
schizophrenia and evaluated the risks added by starting antipsychotic treatment 
in people with schizophrenia.
METHOD: The study followed all people born in Denmark on or after Jan. 1, 1977, 
until Jan. 1, 2013 (N=2,736,510). The Danish Psychiatric Central Research 
Register ascertained schizophrenia diagnoses. The Danish National Prescription 
Registry provided data on prescriptions of antipsychotics. Diabetes was 
ascertained from the Danish National Patient Register and Danish National 
Prescription Registry. The authors estimated the endogenous and 
antipsychotic-related risks for diabetes by using Cox proportional hazards 
regression models, while accounting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Of the cohort members, 14,118 (0.52%) developed diabetes, and 8,945 
(0.33%) developed schizophrenia during follow-up (49,582,279 person-years). The 
adjusted hazard ratio for diabetes was 3.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.71-5.41) in antipsychotic-naive schizophrenia compared with the general 
population. The risk for diabetes after starting antipsychotic treatment was 
significantly higher (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.95-6.82) than the 
risk in antipsychotic-naive schizophrenia, after adjustment for family history 
of diabetes and other potential confounders. First-line treatment with either 
first-generation antipsychotics (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.32-7.05) 
or second-generation antipsychotics (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.44; 95% CI, 
1.73-6.83) increased the risk for diabetes without a statistically significant 
difference. Appropriate sensitivity analyses limited to type 2 diabetes 
corroborated these results.
CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia confers a high endogenous risk for diabetes, and the 
risk is further increased by both first-generation and second-generation 
antipsychotics. Early detection and effective treatment of diabetes should be an 
integral part of multidisciplinary management of schizophrenia regardless of 
antipsychotic drug exposure.

INTRODUCTION: There is a growing proportion of population aged 65 years and 
older in low-income and middle-income countries. In Malaysia, this proportion is 
predicted to increase from 5.1% in 2010 to more than 15.4% by 2050. Cognitive 
ageing and dementia are global health priorities. However, risk factors and 
disease associations in a multiethnic, middle-income country like Malaysia may 
not be consistent with those reported in other world regions. Knowing the burden 
of cognitive impairment and its risk factors in Malaysia is necessary for the 
development of management strategies and would provide valuable information for 
other transitional economies.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a community-based feasibility study focused on the 
assessment of cognition, embedded in the longitudinal study of health and 
demographic surveillance site of the South East Asia Community Observatory 
(SEACO), in Malaysia. In total, 200 adults aged ≥50 years are selected for an 
in-depth health and cognitive assessment including the Mini Mental State 
Examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, blood pressure, anthropometry, 
gait speed, hand grip strength, Depression Anxiety Stress Score and dried blood 
spots.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results will inform the feasibility, response 
rates and operational challenges for establishing an ageing study focused on 
cognitive function in similar middle-income country settings. Knowing the burden 
of cognitive impairment and dementia and risk factors for disease will inform 
local health priorities and management, and place these within the context of 
increasing life expectancy.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol is approved by the Monash 
University Human Research Ethics Committee. Informed consent is obtained from 
all the participants. The project's analysed data and findings will be made 
available through publications and conference presentations and a data sharing 
archive. Reports on key findings will be made available as community briefs on 
the SEACO website.

Vision represents one of the main senses for humans to interact with their 
environment. Our sight relies on the presence of fully functional light 
sensitive cells - rod and cone photoreceptors - allowing us to see under dim 
(rods) and bright (cones) light conditions. Photoreceptor degeneration is one of 
the major causes for vision impairment in industrialized countries and it is 
highly predominant in the population above the age of 50. Thus, with the 
continuous increase in life expectancy it will make retinal degeneration reach 
an epidemic proportion. To date, there is no cure established for photoreceptor 
loss, but several therapeutic approaches, spanning from neuroprotection, 
pharmacological drugs, gene therapy, retinal prosthesis, and cell (RPE or 
photoreceptor) transplantation, have been developed over the last decade with 
some already introduced in clinical trials. In this review, we focus on current 
developments in photoreceptor transplantation strategies, its major 
breakthroughs, current limitations and the next challenges to translate such 
cell-based approaches toward clinical application.

The most common site for cancer to spread is bone. At post-mortem, bony 
metastases have been found in 70% of patients dying from breast and prostate 
cancer. Due to the prevalence of cancer, bone metastasis and the associated 
management represents a huge burden on NHS resources. In patients with 
metastasis, around 56% of these involve the lower limb long bones. Due to the 
huge forces placed upon long bones during weight bearing, there is a high risk 
of fracture through areas of metastasis. It is reported that 23% of pathological 
fractures occur in the femoral subtrochanteric region. This area is subjected to 
forces up to four times the body weight, resulting in poor union rate for these 
fractures, and significant morbidity associated with difficulty in mobilising, 
and in patient nursing. As cancer treatments improve, the life expectancy in 
this subgroup of patients is likely to increase. Therefore medium-to-long-term 
management of these fractures, beyond the palliative, will become essential. We 
aim to evaluate the current management for metastatic malignant femoral disease, 
with particular focus on the prophylactic augmentation of diseased femorii using 
intramedullary nails.

Cancer care continues to stress the US healthcare system with increases in life 
expectancy, cancer prevalence, and survivors' complex needs. These challenges 
are compounded by socioeconomic, racial, and cultural disparities that are 
associated with poor clinical outcomes. One innovative and resource-wise 
strategy to address this demand on the system is expanded use of telehealth. 
This paradigm has the potential to decrease healthcare and patient out-of-pocket 
costs and improve patient adherence to recommended treatment and/or 
surveillance.

Clinical prediction and the idea of a population.

Armstrong D(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London, 
London, UK.

Using an analysis of the British Medical Journal over the past 170 years, this 
article describes how changes in the idea of a population have informed new 
technologies of medical prediction. These approaches have largely replaced older 
ideas of clinical prognosis based on understanding the natural histories of the 
underlying pathologies. The 19th-century idea of a population, which provided a 
denominator for medical events such as births and deaths, was constrained in its 
predictive power by its method of enumerating individual bodies. During the 20th 
century, populations were increasingly constructed through inferential 
techniques based on patient groups and samples seen to possess variable 
characteristics. The emergence of these new virtual populations created the 
conditions for the emergence of predictive algorithms that are used to foretell 
our medical futures.

BACKGROUND: Transcriptional changes that contribute to the organism's longevity 
and prevent the age-dependent decline of biological functions are not well 
understood. Here, we overexpressed pro-longevity gene encoding 
glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc) and analyzed age-dependent 
changes in transcriptome that associated with the longevity, stress resistance, 
locomotor activity, circadian rhythmicity, and fertility.
RESULTS: Here we reproduced the life extension effect of neuronal overexpression 
of the Gclc gene and investigated its influence on the age-depended dynamics of 
transcriptome and biological functions such as fecundity, spontaneous locomotor 
activity and circadian rhythmicity, as well as on the resistance to oxidative, 
proteotoxic and osmotic stresses. It was shown that Gclc overexpression reduces 
locomotor activity in the young and middle ages compared to control flies. Gclc 
overexpression slowed down the age-dependent decline of locomotor activity and 
circadian rhythmicity, and resistance to stress treatments. Gclc level 
demonstrated associations with the expression of genes involved in a variety of 
cellular processes including Jak-STAT, MAPK, FOXO, Notch, mTOR, TGF-beta 
signaling pathways, translation, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, 
proteasomal degradation, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, 
regulation of circadian rhythms, differentiation of neurons, synaptic plasticity 
and transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that Gclc overexpression induces transcriptional 
changes associated with the lifespan extension and uncovered pathways that may 
be associated with the age-dependent decline of biological functions.

BACKGROUND: Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight, so initial 
treatment is aimed at reducing weight and increasing physical activity. Even 
modest weight loss can improve control of blood glucose. If drug treatment is 
necessary, the drug of first choice is metformin. However, some people cannot 
tolerate metformin, which causes diarrhoea in about 10%, and it cannot be used 
in people with renal impairment. This review appraises three of the newest class 
of drugs for monotherapy when metformin cannot be used, the sodium-glucose 
co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.
OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
dapagliflozin (Farxiga, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Luton, UK), canagliflozin 
(Invokana, Janssen, High Wycombe, UK) and empagliflozin (Jardiance, Merck & Co., 
Darmstadt, Germany), in monotherapy in people who cannot take metformin.
SOURCES: MEDLINE (1946 to February 2015) and EMBASE (1974 to February 2015) for 
randomised controlled trials lasting 24 weeks or more. For adverse events, a 
wider range of studies was used. Three manufacturers provided submissions.
METHODS: Systematic review and economic evaluation. A network meta-analysis was 
carried out involving the three SGLT2 inhibitors and key comparators. Critical 
appraisal of submissions from three manufacturers.
RESULTS: We included three trials of dapagliflozin and two each for 
canagliflozin and empagliflozin. The trials were of good quality. The 
canagliflozin and dapagliflozin trials compared them with placebo, but the two 
empagliflozin trials included active comparators. All three drugs were shown to 
be effective in improving glycaemic control, promoting weight loss and lowering 
blood pressure (BP).
LIMITATIONS: There were no head-to-head trials of the different flozins, and no 
long-term data on cardiovascular outcomes in this group of patients. Most trials 
were against placebo. The trials were done in patient groups that were not 
always comparable, for example in baseline glycated haemoglobin or body mass 
index. Data on elderly patients were lacking.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin are effective in 
improving glycaemic control, with added benefits of some reductions in BP and 
weight. Adverse effects are urinary and genital tract infections in a small 
proportion of users. In monotherapy, the three drugs do not appear 
cost-effective compared with gliclazide or pioglitazone, but may be competitive 
against sitagliptin (Januvia, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bracknell, UK).

It has been estimated that globally there is a death attributable to prostate 
cancer every four minutes. As life expectancy in all world regions increases, so 
too incidence of this disease of the ageing male will increase. For many men 
diagnosis occurs after presentation with symptoms of altered urinary dynamics. 
Unfortunately, these changes, whilst also associated with benign disease, are 
evident quite late in the aetiology of prostate cancer. Early detection provides 
for better management and prognosis. This Special Issue provides an up to date 
view of the advances made towards early diagnosis and prognosis. It provides 
reviews of advanced imaging techniques (e.g., multiparametric MRI and 
protocols), and of biomaterials and molecular biomarkers currently being 
explored (e.g., microRNAs, proteomics) and the technologies that are 
revolutionizing this field. It describes the multi-disciplinary approaches that 
are essential to inexpensive, deliverable and accurate platforms for prostate 
cancer diagnostics.

The number of elderly and chronically ill patients has grown significantly over 
the past few decades as life expectancy has increased worldwide, leading to 
increased demands on the health care system and significantly taxing traditional 
health care practices. Consequently, there is an urgent need to use technology 
to innovate and more constantly and intensely monitor, report and analyze 
critical patient physiological parameters beyond conventional clinical settings 
in a more efficient and cost effective manner. This paper presents a 
technological platform called PlaIMoS which consists of wearable sensors, a 
fixed measurement station, a network infrastructure that employs IEEE 802.15.4 
and IEEE 802.11 to transmit data with security mechanisms, a server to analyze 
all information collected and apps for iOS, Android and Windows 10 mobile 
operating systems to provide real-time measurements. The developed architecture, 
designed primarily to record and report electrocardiogram and heart rate data, 
also monitors parameters associated with chronic respiratory illnesses, 
including patient blood oxygen saturation and respiration rate, body 
temperature, fall detection and galvanic resistance.

The hazard ratios resulting from a Cox's regression hazards model are hard to 
interpret and to be converted into prolonged survival time. As the main goal is 
often to study survival functions, there is increasing interest in summary 
measures based on the survival function that are easier to interpret than the 
hazard ratio; the residual mean time is an important example of those measures. 
However, because of the presence of right censoring, the tail of the survival 
distribution is often difficult to estimate correctly. Therefore, we consider 
the restricted residual mean time, which represents a partial area under the 
survival function, given any time horizon τ, and is interpreted as the residual 
life expectancy up to τ of a subject surviving up to time t. We present a class 
of regression models for this measure, based on weighted estimating equations 
and inverse probability of censoring weighted estimators to model potential 
right censoring. Furthermore, we show how to extend the models and the 
estimators to deal with delayed entries. We demonstrate that the restricted 
residual mean life estimator is equivalent to integrals of Kaplan-Meier 
estimates in the case of simple factor variables. Estimation performance is 
investigated by simulation studies. Using real data from Danish Monitoring 
Cardiovascular Risk Factor Surveys, we illustrate an application to additive 
regression models and discuss the general assumption of right censoring and left 
truncation being dependent on covariates. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons,

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of panitumumab in combination with 
mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin) vs bevacizumab in 
combination with mFOLFOX6 as first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in Spain.
METHODS: A semi-Markov model was developed including the following health 
states: Progression free; Progressive disease: Treat with best supportive care; 
Progressive disease: Treat with subsequent active therapy; Attempted resection 
of metastases; Disease free after metastases resection; Progressive disease: 
after resection and relapse; and Death. Parametric survival analyses of 
patient-level progression free survival and overall survival data from the PEAK 
Phase II clinical trial were used to estimate health state transitions. 
Additional data from the PEAK trial were considered for the dose and duration of 
therapy, the use of subsequent therapy, the occurrence of adverse events, and 
the incidence and probability of time to metastasis resection. Utility 
weightings were calculated from patient-level data from panitumumab trials 
evaluating first-, second-, and third-line treatments. The study was performed 
from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective including only direct 
costs. A life-time horizon was applied. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and 
scenario sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the 
model.
RESULTS: Based on the PEAK trial, which demonstrated greater efficacy of 
panitumumab vs bevacizumab, both in combination with mFOLFOX6 first-line in 
wild-type RAS mCRC patients, the estimated incremental cost per life-year gained 
was €16,567 and the estimated incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year 
gained was €22,794. The sensitivity analyses showed the model was robust to 
alternative parameters and assumptions.
LIMITATIONS: The analysis was based on a simulation model and, therefore, the 
results should be interpreted cautiously.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the PEAK Phase II clinical trial and taking into account 
Spanish costs, the results of the analysis showed that first-line treatment of 
mCRC with panitumumab + mFOLFOX6 could be considered a cost-effective option 
compared with bevacizumab + mFOLFOX6 for the Spanish NHS.

Treatment of Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy in Older Adults with Diabetes 
Mellitus.

Scheinberg N, Salbu RL, Goswami G, Cohen K.

OBJECTIVE: To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, screening and diagnosis, 
and optimal treatment of diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) and its 
implications in older adults.
DATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, DATA SYNTHESIS: A search of 
PubMed using the Mesh terms "diabetes," "type 1," "insulin-dependent," "T1DM," 
and "diabetic autonomic neuropathy" was performed to find relevant primary 
literature. Additional search terms "epidemiology," "geriatric," and "risk" were 
employed. All English-language articles from 2005 to 2015 appearing in these 
searches were reviewed for relevance. Related articles suggested in the PubMed 
search and clinical guidelines from the American Diabetes Association and the 
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists were reviewed. These uncovered 
further resources for risk stratification, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and 
treatment of DAN. DAN is highly prevalent in the diabetes population and 
increases the risk of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet, often goes 
undiagnosed and untreated. Treatment of DAN is complex in the older adult 
because of poor tolerability of many pharmacologic treatment options; therefore, 
great care must be taken when selecting therapy as to avoid unwanted adverse 
effects.
CONCLUSION: With increasing life-expectancy of patients with diabetes mellitus, 
awareness of DAN and its implications to older adults is needed in primary care. 
Consistent screening and appropriate treatment of DAN in older adults with 
diabetes mellitus is essential in helping to maintain functional status and 
avoid adverse events.

The burden of disease framework facilitates the assessment of the health impact 
of diseases through the use of summary measures of population health such as 
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). However, calculating, interpreting and 
communicating the results of studies using this methodology poses a challenge. 
The aim of the Burden of Communicable Disease in Europe (BCoDE) project is to 
summarize the impact of communicable disease in the European Union and European 
Economic Area Member States (EU/EEA MS). To meet this goal, a user-friendly 
software tool (BCoDE toolkit), was developed. This stand-alone application, 
written in C++, is open-access and freely available for download from the 
website of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). With 
the BCoDE toolkit, one can calculate DALYs by simply entering the age group- and 
sex-specific number of cases for one or more of selected sets of 32 communicable 
diseases (CDs) and 6 healthcare associated infections (HAIs). Disease 
progression models (i.e., outcome trees) for these communicable diseases were 
created following a thorough literature review of their disease progression 
pathway. The BCoDE toolkit runs Monte Carlo simulations of the input parameters 
and provides disease-specific results, including 95% uncertainty intervals, and 
permits comparisons between the different disease models entered. Results can be 
displayed as mean and median overall DALYs, DALYs per 100,000 population, and 
DALYs related to mortality vs. disability. Visualization options summarize 
complex epidemiological data, with the goal of improving communication and 
knowledge transfer for decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with chronic low-grade 
inflammation, several medical comorbidities and a decreased life expectancy. 
Metabolic-inflammatory changes have been postulated as one of the main links 
between BD and medical comorbidity, although there are few studies exploring 
possible mechanisms underlying this relationship. Therefore, the aims of the 
current narrative review were 1) synthesize the evidence for 
metabolic-inflammatory changes that may facilitate the link between medical 
comorbidity and BD and 2) discuss therapeutic and preventive implications of 
these pathways.
METHODS: The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant 
studies.
RESULTS: Identified studies suggested that there is an increased risk of medical 
comorbidities, such as autoimmune disorders, obesity, diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease in patients with BD. The association between BD and 
general medical comorbidities seems to be bidirectional and potentially mediated 
by immune dysfunction. Targeting the metabolic-inflammatory-mood pathway may 
potential yield improved outcomes in BD; however, further study is needed to 
determine which specific interventions may be beneficial.
LIMITATIONS: The majority of identified studies had cross-sectional designs, 
small sample sizes and limited measurements of inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment and prevention of general medical comorbidities in mood 
disorders should include preferential prescribing of metabolically neutral 
agents and adjunctive lifestyle modifications including increased physical 
activity, improved diet and decreased substance abuse. In addition, the use of 
anti-inflammatory agents could be a relevant therapeutic target in future 
research.

BACKGROUND: Opioid agonist therapy using methadone, an effective treatment of 
opioid use disorders (OUD) for people who inject drugs (PWID), is recommended by 
the World Health Organization as essential to curtail the growing HIV epidemic. 
Yet, despite increasing prevalence of OUD and HIV, methadone therapy has not yet 
been implemented in Russia. The aim of this modeling study was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of methadone therapy for Russian adults with a diagnosed OUD.
METHODS/DESIGN: We modeled the projected program implementation costs and 
estimated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted over a 10-year period, 
associated with the provision of methadone therapy for a hypothetical, 
unreplenished cohort of Russian adults with an OUD (n = 249,000), in comparison 
to the current therapies at existing addiction treatment facilities. Our model 
compared four distinct scenarios of treatment coverage in the cohort ranging 
from 3.1 to 55%.
RESULTS: Providing methadone therapy to as few as 3.1% of adults with an OUD 
amounted to an estimated almost 50,000 DALYs averted over 10 years at a cost of 
just over USD 17 million. Further expanding service coverage to 55% resulted in 
an estimated almost 900,000 DALYs averted, at a cost of about USD 308 million.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that implementing opioid agonist therapy with 
methadone to treat OUD at existing facilities in Russia is highly 
cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Injury represents one of the greatest public health challenges of 
our time with over 5 million deaths and 100 million people temporarily or 
permanently disabled every year worldwide. The effectiveness of trauma systems 
in decreasing injury mortality and morbidity has been well demonstrated. 
However, the organisation of trauma care varies significantly across trauma 
systems and we know little about which components of trauma systems contribute 
to their effectiveness. The objective of the study described in this protocol is 
to systematically review evidence of the impact of trauma system components on 
clinically significant outcomes including mortality, function and disability, 
quality of life, and resource utilization.
METHODS: We will perform a systematic review of studies evaluating the 
association between at least one trauma system component (e.g. accreditation by 
a central agency, interfacility transfer agreements) and at least one injury 
outcome (e.g. mortality, disability, resource use). We will search MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, COCHRANE central, and BIOSIS/Web of Knowledge databases, thesis 
holdings, key injury organisation websites and conference proceedings for 
eligible studies. Pairs of independent reviewers will evaluate studies for 
eligibility and extract data from included articles. Methodological quality will 
be evaluated using elements of the ROBINS-I tool and the Cochrane risk of bias 
tool for non-randomized and randomized studies, respectively. Strength of 
evidence will be evaluated using the GRADE tool.
DISCUSSION: We expect to advance knowledge on the components of trauma systems 
that contribute to their effectiveness. This may lead to recommendations on 
trauma system structure that will help policy-makers make informed decisions as 
to where resources should be focused. The review may also lead to specific 
recommendations for future research efforts.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited stage 
small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) prevents brain metastases and improves 
survival, with the potential for neurocognitive toxicity. RTOG0933 demonstrated 
that hippocampal avoidance (HA) during whole brain radiotherapy preserves 
neurocognition. This study's objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
HA-PCI in LS-SCLC through decision analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the clinical 
course of LS-SCLC who received HA-PCI or conventional PCI (C-PCI). A 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY was used. Incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio was calculated (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed 
to determine the parameter thresholds and to assess the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario, HA-PCI is more cost-effective than C-PCI, 
with an ICER of $47,107/QALY. HA-PCI was preferred over C-PCI provided that the 
risk of developing brain metastases was not increased by at least 14%, or if 
neurocognitive dysfunction rates were reduced by at least 40%. HA-PCI was the 
cost-effective strategy in 68% of tested iterations in probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that HA-PCI is more cost-effective than 
C-PCI in LS-SCLC. Our results support the use of HA-PCI in this patient 
population, should results from RTOG0933 be confirmed by the ongoing NRGCC003 
trial.
