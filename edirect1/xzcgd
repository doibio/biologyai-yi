Coronary artery dissection and intramural hematoma after blunt chest trauma are 
rare, but life-threatening, complications. Coronary intramural hematoma 
extension is even rarer. A 31-year-old man was transferred to our hospital for 
worsening left chest pain during while he was admitted at a nearby hospital due 
to blunt chest trauma. Bedside echocardiography showed akinesis of the left 
ventricular apex and anterior wall as well as hypokinesis of the mid-to-basal 
anteroseptal wall and mid-to-basal lateral and posterior walls of the left 
ventricle. Computed tomography coronary angiography revealed intramural hematoma 
in the left main (LM) coronary and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) 
arteries. Percutaneous coronary intervention, with bare metal stent implantation 
from the LM coronary artery to the proximal LAD artery, was performed to treat 
the occlusion caused by the hematoma. After stenting, the hematoma that 
compressed the LM coronary artery shifted the left circumflex (LCX) artery, and 
the intramural hematoma developed and extended to the LCX artery. To resolve 
this occlusion, a drug-eluting stent was successfully implanted in the LCX 
artery. The patient was discharged without complications. At 2-month follow-up, 
he remained asymptomatic, with no recurrence of cardiovascular symptoms. Delayed 
chest pain after trauma should be suspected during coronary dissection, and on 
treatment, care must be taken to extend the hematoma.

Increased life expectancy, due to the rise in life quality and the decline in 
mortality rates, is leading to a society in which the population aged 60 and 
over is growing more rapidly than the entire population. Although various models 
and model organisms have been employed to investigate the mechanism of aging, 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are useful candidates to study human 
aging and age-related human diseases. This work discusses how iPSCs can be used 
as an alternative to the model organisms such as yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, 
Drosophila melanogaster, or the mouse. The main focus is the reprogramming 
technology of somatic cells which is thought to provide an important perspective 
for rejuvenation strategies. The effects and relationships between aging and 
cell reprogramming are discussed, and studies related to aging and cell 
reprogramming are critically reviewed. We believe that for future studies, 
different parameters and detailed quantitative experiments should be performed 
in order to clearly understand the effect of aging on human cell reprogramming 
with respect to programming efficiency and differentiation capacity. This way, 
new insights will be provided to prevent or even reverse the aging process.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) estimates can vary substantially 
across patient subgroups when patient characteristics influence preferences, 
outcome risks, treatment effectiveness, life expectancy, or associated costs. 
However, no systematic review has reported the frequency of subgroup analysis in 
CEA, what type of heterogeneity they address, and how often heterogeneity 
influences whether cost-effectiveness ratios exceed or fall below conventional 
thresholds.
METHODS: We reviewed the CEA literature cataloged in the Tufts Medical Center 
CEA Registry, a repository describing cost-utility analyses published through 
2016. After randomly selecting 200 of 642 articles published in 2014, we 
ascertained whether each study reported subgroup results and collected data on 
the defining characteristics of these subgroups. We identified whether any of 
the CEA subgroup results crossed conventional cost-effectiveness benchmarks 
(e.g., $100,000 per QALY) and compared characteristics of studies with and 
without subgroup-specific findings.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies (19%) reported patient subgroup results. Articles 
reporting subgroup analyses were more likely to be US-based, government funded 
(v. drug industry- or nonprofit foundation-funded) studies, with a focus on 
primary or secondary (v. tertiary) prevention (P < 0.05 for comparisons). One or 
more patient characteristics were used to stratify CEA results 68 times within 
the 38 studies, with most stratifications using one characteristic (n = 47), 
most commonly age (n = 35). Among the 23 stratifications reported alongside 
average ratios in US studies, 13 produced subgroup ratios that crossed a 
conventional CEA ratio benchmark.
CONCLUSIONS: Most CEAs do not report any subgroup results, and those that do 
most often stratify only by patient age. Over half of the subgroup analyses 
reported could lead to different value-based decision making for at least some 
patients.

Cement Augmentation of the Cervical Spine - a Technique Enhancing Stability of 
Anterior Cervical Plating.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of this study is to describe a new technique for 
cement augmentation of primary anterior cervical screw fixation in the sub-axial 
cervical spine. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seven patients underwent anterior cervical 
spine surgery for trauma (two) or tumor infiltration (five) between 2008 and 
2015. The tumor cases underwent corpectomy and anterior plating, with the trauma 
cases undergoing anterior cervical decompression and fusion using iliac crest 
bone graft. All surgeries were performed through the standard anterior approach. 
0.2-0.25 ml of Kyphon cement were introduced into the screw holes before the 
screws were locked into the plate of the anterior construct. Karnofsky Index, 
Spinal Instability Neoplastic score (SINS) were calculated and radiographic 
follow-up performed. RESULTS Median follow-up was 7 months (range 7 weeks-39 
months). There were no complications from cement leakage or construct failure 
during the follow-up period. There were no wound infections or approach-related 
complications. We did not have to re-operate on any patient, cervical spine 
remained stable until the end of follow up. DISCUSSION Until now a limited 
number of papers on cement augmentation of cervical spine mainly dealt with 
revision surgeries, when cement was used as rescue technique to re-establish 
stability of previous fixation or cement augmentation was performed in form of 
vertebroplasty following plate fixation. Our technique intends to prevent 
revision surgeries and to anchor all screws in holes which are evenly filled 
with bone cement. CONCLUSIONS This technique of cement augmentation is a useful 
adjunct in those few patients where a secondary posterior surgery would be 
high-risk due to the general health of the patient, or when life expectancy is 
limited. We have shown that anterior alone reconstruction of the cervical spine 
with cement augmentation of screws did provide sufficient and sufficiently long 
stability of the cervical spine which prevented catastrophic collapse and 
quadriplegia in patients in poor general condition. Key words: cement 
augmentation, cervical spine, corpectomy, tumor, stabilization, fusion.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Adolescents with depression identified in primary 
care settings often have limited treatment options beyond antidepressant (AD) 
therapy. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a brief cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) program among depressed adolescents who declined or quickly 
stopped using ADs.
METHODS: A total of 212 youth with depression were randomly assigned to 
treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus brief individual CBT. Clinical outcomes 
included depression-free days (DFDs) and estimated quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). Costs were adjusted to 2008 US dollars. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) comparing CBT to TAU were calculated over 12- and 24-month 
follow-up periods.
RESULTS: Youth randomly assigned to CBT had 26.8 more DFDs (P = .044) and 0.067 
more QALYs (P = .044) on average compared with TAU over 12 months. Total costs 
were $4976 less (P = .025) by the end of the 24-month follow-up among youth 
randomly assigned to CBT. Total costs per DFD were -$51 (ICER = -$51; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: -$394 to $9) at 12 months and -$115 (ICER = -$115; 95% 
CI: -$1090 to -$6) at 24 months. Total costs per QALY were -$20â282 (ICER = 
-$20â282; 95% CI: -$156â741 to $3617) at 12 months and -$45â792 (ICER = 
-$45â792; 95% CI: -$440â991 to -$2731) at 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Brief primary care CBT among youth declining AD therapy is 
cost-effective by widely accepted standards in depression treatment. CBT becomes 
dominant over TAU over time, as revealed by a statistically significant cost 
offset at the end of the 2-year follow-up.

Understanding the composition of a genetically-encoded (GE) library is 
instrumental to the success of ligand discovery. In this manuscript, we 
investigate the bias in GE-libraries of linear, macrocyclic and chemically 
post-translationally modified (cPTM) tetrapeptides displayed on the M13KE 
platform, which are produced via trinucleotide cassette synthesis (19 codons) 
and NNK-randomized codon. Differential enrichment of synthetic DNA {S}, ligated 
vector {L} (extension and ligation of synthetic DNA into the vector), naÃ¯ve 
libraries {N} (transformation of the ligated vector into the bacteria followed 
by expression of the library for 4.5âhours to yield a "naÃ¯ve" library), and 
libraries chemically modified by aldehyde ligation and cysteine macrocyclization 
{M} characterized by paired-end deep sequencing, detected a significant drop in 
diversity in {L}âââ{N}, but only a minor compositional difference in {S}âââ{L} 
and {N}âââ{M}. Libraries expressed at the N-terminus of phage protein pIII 
censored positively charged amino acids Arg and Lys; libraries expressed between 
pIII domains N1 and N2 overcame Arg/Lys-censorship but introduced new bias 
towards Gly and Ser. Interrogation of biases arising from cPTM by aldehyde 
ligation and cysteine macrocyclization unveiled censorship of sequences with 
Ser/Phe. Analogous analysis can be used to explore library diversity in new 
display platforms and optimize cPTM of these libraries.

BACKGROUND: Thousands of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) in low-income 
countries have limited access to marketed levodopa preparations. Mucuna pruriens 
(MP), a levodopa-containing leguminous plant growing in tropical areas, may be a 
sustainable alternative therapy for indigent patients. Single-dose intake of MP 
proved noninferior to marketed levodopa preparations.
METHODS: Fourteen PD patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias received 
MP powder (obtained from roasted seeds) and marketed levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD) 
in a randomized order and crossover design over a 16-week period. Efficacy 
measures were changes in quality of life, motor and non-motor symptoms, and time 
with good mobility without troublesome dyskinesias. Safety measures included 
tolerability, frequency of adverse events, changes in laboratory indices and 
electrocardiogram.
RESULTS: Daily intake of MP was associated with a variable clinical response, 
especially in terms of tolerability. Seven patients (50%) discontinued MP 
prematurely due to either gastrointestinal side-effects (nâ¯=â¯4) or progressive 
worsening of motor performance (nâ¯=â¯3), while nobody discontinued during the 
LD/CD phase. In those who tolerated MP, clinical response to MP was similar to 
LD/CD on all efficacy outcome measures. Patients who dropped out entered a study 
extension using MP supernatant water (median[IQR], 16 [7-20] weeks), which was 
well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall benefit provided by MP on the clinical outcome was 
limited by tolerability issues, as one could expect by the relatively rapid 
switch from LD/CD to levodopa alone in advanced PD. Larger parallel-group 
studies are needed to identify appropriate MP formulation (e.g. supernatant 
water), titration scheme and maintenance dose to minimize side-effects in the 
long-term. CLINICAL TRIALS.

OBJECTIVES: Switching to a different mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) patients after a first anti-TNF-Î± has proved to be effective. The objective 
of this study was a health economic assessment in Italy.
METHODS: The study was conducted using a pharmacoeconomic model with a 3-year 
time horizon. Effectiveness was measured as days gained in low disease activity 
(LDA; DAS28-ESR <3.2) or in remission (DAS28-ESR <2.6). The model simulated the 
response to treatments, based on the Rotation Or Change (ROC) trial, the 
probability of discontinuation and switch to a 3rd-line biologic, and the 
transition to death. Time on treatment curves for 2nd-line biologics were 
derived from published Italian real-word data. Costs were estimated based on 
published sources and Italian prices and tariffs.
RESULTS: The switch to tocilizumab after the failure of a first anti-TNF-Î± was 
more effective than a second anti-TNF-Î±, in terms of days in remission (224 vs. 
114 days) and of days in LDA (345 vs. 193 days). The cost-consequence ratio with 
tocilizumab iv was 174 euros/day in remission and 113 euros/day in LDA. With 
tocilizumab sc the ratio was 181 euros/day in remission and 117 euros/day in 
LDA. The same ratios for the anti-TNF-Î± treatments ranged from 233 to Euro 320 
euros per day in remission and from 138 to 190 euros per day in LDA.
CONCLUSIONS: The switch to a different mechanism of action, namely tocilizumab, 
after the failure of a first anti-TNF-Î± agent seems a rational strategy for RA 
patients in the Italian setting.

BACKGROUND: Influenza burden in Brazil is considerable with 4.2-6.4 million 
cases in 2008 and influenza-like-illness responsible for 16.9% of 
hospitalizations. Cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination may be assessed by 
different types of models, with limitations due to data availability, 
assumptions, and modelling approach.
OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of model complexity, the cost-utility of 
quadrivalent versus trivalent influenza vaccines in Brazil was estimated using 
three distinct models: a 1-year decision tree population model with three age 
groups (FLOU); a more detailed 1-year population model with five age groups 
(FLORA); and a more complex lifetime multi-cohort Markov model with nine age 
groups (FLORENCE).
METHODS: Analysis 1 (impact of model structure) compared each model using the 
same data inputs (i.e., best available data for FLOU). Analysis 2 (impact of 
increasing granularity) compared each model populated with the best available 
data for that model.
RESULTS: Using the best data for each model, the discounted cost-utility ratio 
of quadrivalent versus trivalent influenza vaccine was R$20,428 with FLOU, 
R$22,768 with FLORA (versus R$20,428 in Analysis 1), and, R$19,257 with FLORENCE 
(versus R$22,490 in Analysis 1) using a lifetime horizon. Conceptual differences 
between FLORA and FLORENCE meant the same assumption regarding increased 
all-cause mortality in at-risk individuals had an opposite effect on the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in Analysis 2 versus 1, and a 
proportionally higher number of vaccinated elderly in FLORENCE reduced this 
ratio in Analysis 2.
DISCUSSION: FLOU provided adequate cost-effectiveness estimates with data in 
broad age groups. FLORA increased insights (e.g., in healthy versus at-risk, 
paediatric, respiratory/non-respiratory complications). FLORENCE provided 
greater insights and precision (e.g., in elderly, costs and complications, 
lifetime cost-effectiveness).
CONCLUSION: All three models predicted a cost per quality-adjusted life year 
gained for quadrivalent versus trivalent influenza vaccine in the range of 
R$19,257 (FLORENCE) to R$22,768 (FLORA) with the best available data in Brazil 
(Appendix A).

Surgery may set the basis for a potential cure or would provide the best 
achievable quality of life in locally advanced or metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (mRCC). However, survival extension with this approach would be scarce 
and not exempt from adverse events, thus preventing its recommendation in an 
already frail patient. An evidence based analysis on the role of surgery in each 
of the possible clinical scenarios involved under this heading may provide a 
clear picture on this issue and would be of value in the decision making 
process. Areas covered: Current literature was queried in PubMed/Medline in a 
systematic fashion. Manuscripts included were selected according to the quality 
of the data provided. A narrative review strategy was adopted to summarize the 
evidence acquired. Expert commentary: A surgery-based multimodal treatment 
approach should be strongly considered after adequate counseling in locally 
advanced and mRCC, since it may provide for additional benefits in terms of 
survival. However, a critical reevaluation of its adequacy, optimal timing, and 
selection of ideal candidates is currently ongoing.

PURPOSE: ToÂ compare, using a cost-effectiveness analysis, the quality-adjusted 
life expectancy (QALE) and cost between the 2 treatment options for 
intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer: (1) radiation (RT) with androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) or (2) radical prostatectomy (RP) followed by adjuvant 
RT for patients with risk factors.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our Markov model allowed patients to transition between 
health states with yearly probabilities of developing cancer recurrence and/or 
toxicity. Probabilities were assigned according to favorable intermediate, 
unfavorable intermediate, or high-risk prostate cancer groups. The primary 
analysis examined outcomes for patients aged 65Â years, whereas secondary 
analyses explored the effects of younger age, elevated baseline cardiovascular 
risk, and the use of salvage therapy. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Across all primary and secondary analyses, and using a wide-range of 
assumptions, RTÂ +Â ADT was the preferred treatment strategy for men with 
intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer. The QALE was higher after RTÂ +Â ADT 
by 0.5 to 1.14 quality-adjusted life years, compared with RP. Radiation plus ADT 
was cost-effective in all situations, falling beneath a threshold of $100,000 
per quality-adjusted life year. Among all risk groups, a greater proportion of 
patients undergoing RP experienced single or multiple treatment toxicities.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiation plus ADT may result in improved QALE compared with RP for 
intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer. Although biochemical failure is 
similar between treatment groups, there is a higher rate of developing multiple 
toxicities among patients treated with upfront RP.

and cause a huge economic burden. A nurse-led collaborative care intervention 
has been set up in order to improve self-management of patients with these 
mental disorders in primary care in Hamburg, Germany. The aim of this study was 
to determine the cost-utility of this nurse-led intervention from the health 
care payer perspective.
METHODS: This analysis was part of a 12-month cluster-randomized controlled 
trial aiming to increase perceived self-efficacy of primary care patients with 
anxiety, depressive or somatic symptoms by collaborative nurse-led 
self-management support compared with routine care. A cost-effectiveness 
analysis using quality-adjusted life years was performed. Net-monetary benefit 
regressions adjusted for baseline differences for different willingness-to-pay 
thresholds were conducted and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were 
constructed.
RESULTS: In total, nâ¯=â¯325 patients (intervention group: nâ¯=â¯134; control group: 
nâ¯=â¯191) with a mean age of 40 from 20 primary care practices were included in 
the analysis. The adjusted differences in quality-adjusted life years and mean 
total costs between intervention group and control group were +0.02 and +â¬1145, 
respectively. Neither of the two differences was statistically significant. The 
probability for cost-effectiveness of the complex nurse-led intervention was 49% 
for a willingness-to-pay of â¬50,000 per additional quality-adjusted life year. 
The probability for cost-effectiveness did not exceed 65%, independent of the 
willingness-to-pay.
CONCLUSION: The complex nurse-led intervention promoting self-management for 
primary care patients with anxiety, depressive or somatic symptoms did not prove 
to be cost-effective relative to routine care from a health care payer 
perspective.

Atypical femur fractures: a distinctive tract of adult hypophosphatasia.

Marini F(1), Brandi ML(1).

Florence, Italy.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a congenital, rare and heterogeneous bone disorder, 
characterized by a deficit of calcified tissue mineralization, leading to 
skeletal deformities and osteomalacia in adults, rickets in infants and 
children, and fragility fractures and premature loss of dentition in children 
and adults. The disease is caused by a reduced or absent expression and activity 
of the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) enzyme, derived from 
inactivating mutations of the alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) gene. Six different 
clinical variants have been reported, defined by the onset age and characterized 
by different degrees of severity. The adult form of HPP presents a wide range of 
clinical manifestations, many of which are non-specific, mild, and often 
overlapping with other metabolic bone diseases. Consequently, many cases of 
adult HPP are, commonly, undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, and, subsequently, wrongly 
or non-treated with severe consequences for patients and a very negative impact 
on their quality of life and life expectancy, as well as with costs due to the 
administration of wrong therapies and treatments of their side effects. The 
occurrence of a fragility atypical femur fracture in the adulthood can be 
suspected as a clinical indication of an undiagnosed adult mild form of HPP; and 
the presence of at least one of this kind of fracture can help in the diagnosis 
of adult HPP, together with conventional HPP biochemical signs.

The loss of knee extension, even if minimal, is disabling and considerably 
affects the individual's quality of life. This loss of extension can be a 
consequence of prior surgery, including a previous anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstruction. Although this loss of extension may be treated through an 
isolated arthroscopic procedure, a more severe case may warrant an invasive 
approach. In these cases, a posterior capsulotomy of the knee may be done if all 
conservative measures have been exhausted. This procedure has been proven to be 
safe and effective in the re-establishment of full extension in the setting of a 
minor flexion contracture of the knee. The purpose of this Technical Note was to 
describe our preferred technique when performing an open posterior capsulotomy 
of the knee for the treatment of minimal extension deficit.

Improved understanding of sex and gender-specific differences in the aetiology, 
mechanisms and epidemiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD) could help 
nephrologists better address the needs of their patients. Population-based 
studies indicate that CKD epidemiology differs by sex, affecting more women than 
men, especially with regard to stage G3 CKD. The effects of longer life 
expectancy on the natural decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with age, 
as well as potential overdiagnosis of CKD through the inappropriate use of GFR 
equations, might be in part responsible for the greater prevalence of CKD in 
women. Somewhat paradoxically, there seems to be a preponderance of men among 
patients starting renal replacement therapy (RRT); the protective effects of 
oestrogens in women and/or the damaging effects of testosterone, together with 
unhealthier lifestyles, might cause kidney function to decline faster in men 
than in women. Additionally, elderly women seem to be more inclined to choose 
conservative care instead of RRT. Dissimilarities between the sexes are also 
apparent in the outcomes of CKD. In patients with predialysis CKD, mortality is 
higher in men than women; however, this difference disappears for patients on 
RRT. Although access to living donor kidneys among men and women seems equal, 
women have reduced access to deceased donor transplantation. Lastly, 
health-related quality of life while on RRT is poorer in women than men, and 
women report a higher burden of symptoms. These findings provide insights into 
differences in the underlying pathophysiology of disease as well as societal 
factors that can be addressed to reduce disparities in access to care and 
outcomes for patients with CKD.

AIMS: Dulaglutide is a new once weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor 
agonist administered via a disposable auto-injection pen for the management of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective of this study was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of dulaglutide vs insulin glargine for the management of T2DM 
from a Japanese healthcare perspective, in accordance with recently approved 
Japanese Cost-Effectiveness Guidelines.
METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (version 9) was used to estimate the 
long-term costs and effects of treatment with dulaglutide and insulin glargine. 
Direct comparative data from the Araki 2015 trial (NCT01584232) was used to 
inform the analysis. Costs associated with treatment and complications were 
derived from Japanese sources wherever possible and inflated to 2015 Japanese 
Yen (JPY). Utilities were based upon a European systematic review of diabetes 
utilities and adjusted for use in a Japanese population. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (OWSA and PSA) were conducted on all inputs 
and key modeling assumptions.
RESULTS: Dulaglutide 0.75âmg was associated with higher quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), life years (LYs), and total costs, compared to insulin glargine, 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 416,280 JPY/QALY 
gained. Treatment with dulaglutide increased the time alive and free from 
diabetes-related complications by 4 months. OWSA and PSA indicated that results 
were robust to plausible variations in input parameters and modeling 
assumptions.
LIMITATIONS: Key limitations of this study are similar to other cost-utility 
analyses of diabetes, including the extrapolation of short-term clinical trial 
data into lifelong durations. In addition, due to the lack of robust published 
Japanese data, some values were derived from non-Japanese sources.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that dulaglutide 0.75âmg may be a 
cost-effective treatment alternative to insulin glargine for patients with T2DM 
in Japan.

Parental age and offspring mortality: Negative effects of reproductive ageing 
may be counterbalanced by secular increases in longevity.

As parental ages at birth continue to rise, concerns about the effects of 
fertility postponement on offspring are increasing. Due to reproductive ageing, 
advanced parental ages have been associated with negative health outcomes for 
offspring, including decreased longevity. The literature, however, has neglected 
to examine the potential benefits of being born at a later date. Secular 
declines in mortality mean that later birth cohorts are living longer. We 
analyse mortality over ages 30-74 among 1.9 million Swedish men and women born 
1938-60, and use a sibling comparison design that accounts for all 
time-invariant factors shared by the siblings. When incorporating cohort 
improvements in mortality, we find that those born to older mothers do not 
suffer any significant mortality disadvantage, and that those born to older 
fathers have lower mortality. These findings are likely to be explained by 
secular declines in mortality counterbalancing the negative effects of 
reproductive ageing.

BACKGROUND: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between 
normal cognition and dementia.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of vascular risk 
factors, vascular diseases, cerebrovascular disease and brain atrophy in a large 
hospital-based cohort of MCI types including 471 amnestic MCI (a-MCI), 693 
amnestic MCI multiple domain (a-MCImd), 322 single non-memory MCI (snm-MCI), and 
202 non amnestic MCI multiple domain (na-MCImd). For comparison, 1,005 
neurologically and cognitively healthy subjects were also evaluated.
METHOD: Several vascular risk factors and vascular diseases were assessed. All 
participants underwent neurological, neuropsychological and behavioural 
assessments as well as carotid ultrasonography and standard brain MRI. 
Multinomial logistic regression models on the MCI cohort with the NCH group and 
a-MCI type as reference categories were used to assess the effects of the 
variables evaluated on the estimated probability of one of the four MCI types.
RESULTS: This study demonstrates that cerebrovascular disease contributes 
substantially to the risk of non-memory MCI types and a-MCImd type, and that 
brain atrophy is present in all MCI types and is greater in multiple domain 
types particularly in the na-MCI type.
CONCLUSION: Improving detection and control of cerebrovascular disease in aging 
individuals should be mandatory. Since the incidence of MCI and dementia will be 
expected to rise because of the progressive life expectancy, a better management 
of cerebrovascular disease could indeed prevent or delay the onset of MCI, or 
could delay progression of MCI to dementia.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) can be conceptualized as a continuum: 
patients progress from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due 
to AD, followed by increasing severity of AD dementia. Prior research has 
measured transition probabilities among later stages of AD, but not for the 
complete spectrum.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate annual progression rates across the AD continuum and 
evaluate the impact of a delay in MCI due to AD on the trajectory of AD dementia 
and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Patient-level longitudinal data from the National Alzheimer's 
Coordinating Center for n=18,103 patients with multiple visits over the age of 
65 were used to estimate annual, age-specific transitional probabilities between 
normal cognition, MCI due to AD, and AD severity states (defined by Clinical 
Dementia Rating score). Multivariate models predicted the likelihood of death 
and institutionalization for each health state, conditional on age and time from 
the previous evaluation. These probabilities were used to populate a transition 
matrix describing the likelihood of progressing to a particular disease state or 
death for any given current state and age. Finally, a health state model was 
developed to estimate the expected effect of a reduction in the risk of 
transitioning from normal cognition to MCI due to AD on disease progression 
rates for a cohort of 65-year-old patients over a 35-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Annual transition probabilities to more severe states were 8%, 22%, 
25%, 36%, and 16% for normal cognition, MCI due to AD, and mild/moderate/severe 
AD, respectively, at age 65, and increased as a function of age. Progression 
rates from normal cognition to MCI due to AD ranged from 4% to 10% annually. 
Severity of cognitive impairment and age both increased the likelihood of 
institutionalization and death. For a cohort of 100 patients with normal 
cognition at age 65, a 20% reduction in the annual progression rate to MCI due 
to AD avoided 5.7 and 5.6 cases of MCI due to AD and AD, respectively. This 
reduction led to less time spent in severe AD dementia health states and 
institutionalized, and increased life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: Transition probabilities from normal cognition through AD severity 
states are important for understanding patient progression across the AD 
spectrum. These estimates can be used to evaluate the clinical benefits of 
reducing progression from normal cognition to MCI due to AD on lifetime health 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: According to the recommendations of the World Health Organization 
Commission On Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) for intersectoral action on 
health, the well-being of and equity in health within a population are achieved 
via a complex fusion of policies and actions. In this study, following the 
CSDH's approach and considering set-theoretic relations, we aimed to unravel 
this complexity and answer the kinds of questions that are outside the scope of 
conventional variable-oriented approach.
METHODS: A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of 131 countries was 
conducted to examine the configurational effects of five macro-level structural 
conditions on life expectancy at birth. The potential causal conditions were 
level of country wealth, income inequality, quality of governance, education, 
and health system. The data collected from different international data sources 
were recorded during 2004-2015.
RESULTS: The intermediate solution of the truth table analysis indicated a 
configuration of conditions including high level of governance, education, 
wealth, and affluent health system to be consistently sufficient for high life 
expectancy. On the other hand, four configurations, each containing two or three 
conditions, were consistent with being usually sufficient to cause low life 
expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: We were able to configurationally explore the cases and specify the 
combinations of potentially causal conditions which were usually sufficient to 
explain high or low life expectancy in different countries. As a result, 
particular cases were identified for further research. In addition, research may 
provide support for the CSDH's recommendations emphasizing the importance of 
intersectoral action for health.

Relative survival has been used as a measure of the temporal evolution of the 
excess risk of death of a cohort of patients diagnosed with cancer, taking into 
account the mortality of a reference population. Once the excess risk of death 
has been estimated, three probabilities can be computed at time T: 1) the crude 
probability of death associated with the cause of initial diagnosis (disease 
under study), 2) the crude probability of death associated with other causes, 
and 3) the probability of absolute survival in the cohort at time T. This paper 
presents the WebSurvCa application (https://shiny.snpstats.net/WebSurvCa/), 
whereby hospital-based and population-based cancer registries and registries of 
other diseases can estimate such probabilities in their cohorts by selecting the 
mortality of the relevant region (reference population).

BACKGROUND: Escalating health care spending is a concern in Western countries, 
given the lack of evidence of a direct connection between spending and 
improvements in health. We aimed to determine the association between spending 
on health care and social programs and health outcomes in Canada.
METHODS: We used retrospective data from Canadian provincial expenditure 
reports, for the period 1981 to 2011, to model the effects of social and health 
spending (as a ratio, social/health) on potentially avoidable mortality, infant
