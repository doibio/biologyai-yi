OBJECTIVE: Surgical evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) in cancer 
patients is often contraindicated owing to refractory thrombocytopenia. Middle 
meningeal artery embolization (MMAE) recently emerged as a potential alternative 
to surgical evacuation for patients with chronic SDH. The goal of this study was 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MMAE for chronic SDH in cancer patients 
with refractory thrombocytopenia.
METHODS: A multiinstitutional registry was reviewed for clinical and 
radiographic outcomes of cancer patients with transfusion-refractory 
thrombocytopenia and baseline platelet count < 75 K/µl, who underwent MMAE for 
chronic SDH.
RESULTS: MMAE was performed on a total of 31 SDHs in 22 patients, with a mean ± 
SD (range) platelet count of 42.1 ± 18.3 (9-74) K/µl. At the longest follow-up, 
24 SDHs (77%) had reduced in size, with 15 (48%) showing > 50% reduction. Two 
patients required surgical evacuation after MMAE. There was only 1 procedural 
complication; however, 16 patients (73%) ultimately died of cancer-related 
complications. Median survival was significantly longer in the 16 patients with 
improved SDH than the 6 patients with worsened SDH after MMAE (185 vs 24 days, p 
= 0.029). Length of procedure, technical success rate, SDH size reduction, and 
complication rate were not significantly differ between patients who underwent 
transfemoral and transradial approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Transfemoral or transradial MMAE is a potential therapeutic option 
for thrombocytopenic cancer patients with SDH. However, treatment benefit may be 
marginal for patients with high disease burden and limited life expectancy. A 
prospective trial is warranted to address these questions.

INTRODUCTION: Despite having very high life expectancy, Japan has relatively 
poor self-rated health, compared to other high-income countries. We studied 
trends and socioeconomic inequalities in self-rated health in Japan using 
nationally representative data.
METHODS: The Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions was analyzed, every 3 
years (n ≈ 0.6-0.8 million/year) from 1986 to 2016. Whereas previous studies 
dichotomized self-rated health as an outcome, we used four categories: very 
good, good, fair, and bad/very bad. Proportional odds ordinal logistic 
regression models are used, with ordinal scale self-rated health as an outcome, 
and age category, survey year and occupational class or educational level as 
independent variables.
RESULTS: In 2016, the age-adjusted percentages for self-rated health categorized 
as very good, good, fair, and bad/very bad, were 24.0, 17.1, 48.7, and 10.2% 
among working-age men, and 21.6, 17.5, 49.4, and 11.5% among working-age women, 
respectively. With 1986 as the reference year, the odds ratios (ORs) of less 
good self-rated health were lowest in 1995 (0.69; 95% Confidence Interval [95% 
CI]: 0.66-0.71 of working-age men), and highest in 2010 (1.23 [95% CI: 
1.19-1.27]). The ORs of male, lower non-manual workers (compared to upper 
non-manual) increased from 1.12 (95% CI: 1.07-1.17) in 2010 to 1.20 (95% CI: 
1.15-1.26) in 2016. Between 2010 and 2016, the ORs of working-age men with 
middle and low levels of education (compared to a high level of education) 
increased from 1.22 (95% CI: 1.18-1.27) to 1.34 (95% CI: 1.29-1.38), and from 
1.47 (95% CI: 1.39-1.56) to 1.75 (95% CI: 1.63-1.88), respectively. The ORs of 
working-age women with middle and low levels of education also increased from 
1.22 (95% CI: 1.17-1.28) to 1.32 (95% CI: 1.26-1.37), and from 1.74 (95% CI: 
1.61-1.88) to 2.03 (95% CI: 1.87-2.21) during the same period.
CONCLUSION: Japan has the unique feature that approximately 50% of the survey 
respondents rated their self-rated health as fair, but with important variations 
over time and between socioeconomic groups. In-depth studies of the role of 
socioeconomic conditions may shed light on the reasons for the high prevalence 
of poor self-rated health in Japan.

The plant soil feedback (PSF) framework has been instrumental in understanding 
the impacts of soil microbes on plant fitness and species coexistence. PSFs 
develop when soil microbial communities are altered due to the identity and 
density of a particular plant species, which can then enhance or inhibit the 
local survival and growth of that plant species as well as different plant 
species. The recent extension of the PSF framework to aboveground microbiota, 
termed here as plant phyllosphere feedbacks (PPFs), can also help to determine 
the impact of aboveground microbes on plant fitness and species interactions. 
However, experimental tests of PPFs during early plant growth are nascent and 
the prevalence of PPFs across diverse plant species remains unknown. 
Additionally, it is unclear whether plant host characteristics, such as 
functional traits or phylogenetic distance, may help to predict the strength and 
direction of PPFs. To test for the prevalence of litter-mediated PPFs, recently 
senesced plant litter from 10 native Asteraceae species spanning a range of life 
history strategies was used to inoculate seedlings of both conspecific and 
heterospecific species. We found that exposure to conspecific litter 
significantly reduced the growth of four species relative to exposure to 
heterospecific litter (i.e., significant negative PPFs), three species 
experienced marginally significant negative PPFs, and the PPF estimates for all 
10 species were negative. However, neither plant functional traits, nor 
phylogenetic distance were predictive of litter feedbacks across plant species 
pairs, suggesting that other mechanisms or traits not measured may be driving 
conspecific negative PPFs. Our results indicate that negative, litter-mediated 
PPFs are common among native Asteraceae species and that they may have 
substantial impacts on plant growth and plant species interactions, particularly 
during early plant growth.

CML Chapter.

The discovery of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib in the early 
2000's revolutionized the treatment and prognosis of patients with chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML) [Hochhaus et al. in N Engl J Med 376:917-927, 2017]. The 
treatment of patients with CML has changed dramatically since the approval of 
imatinib and other TKIs. Before the TKI era, newly diagnosed patients would 
undergo HLA typing to try to identify a well-matched donor, and then proceed 
quickly to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). With the 
introduction of imatinib followed a few years later by dasatinib, nilotinib, 
then bosutinib, treatment approaches changed in a dramatic way. Transplantation 
is no longer an upfront treatment option for newly diagnosed CML patients, and 
in fact, it is very rarely used in the management of a patient with CML 
currently. The management of CML patients has been a model of personalized 
medicine or targeted therapy that is being emulated in the treatment of many 
other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors such as lung cancer [Soverini et 
al. in Mol Cancer 17:49, 2018]. The Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph) which leads to 
the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene and its product the BCR-ABL protein is 
the cause of CML. With effective targeting of this protein with the available 
TKIs, the disease is completely controllable if not curable for most patients. 
Life expectancy for patients with CML is essentially normal. Quality of life 
becomes an important goal including the potential for pregnancy, and ultimately 
the chance to discontinue all TKI therapy permanently. The three cases outlined 
below serve to highlight some of the important issues in the management of 
patients with CML in the post-TKI era.

Age-specific fecundity under pathogenic threat in an insect: Terminal investment 
versus reproductive restraint.

The terminal investment hypothesis predicts that as an organism's prospects for 
survival decrease, through age or when exposed to a pathogenic infection, it 
will invest more in reproduction, which should trade-off against somatic 
maintenance (including immunity) and therefore future survival. Attempts to test 
this hypothesis have produced mixed results, which, in addition, mainly rely on 
the assessment of changes in reproductive effort and often overlooking its 
impact on somatic defences and survival. Alternatively, animals may restrain 
current reproduction to sustain somatic protection, increasing the chance of 
surviving for additional reproductive opportunities. We tested both of these 
hypotheses in females of the yellow mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor, an 
iteroparous insect with reproductive tactics similar to that of long-lived 
organisms. To achieve this, we mimicked pathogenic bacterial infections early or 
late in the life of breeding females by injecting them with a suspension of 
inactivated Bacillus cereus, a known natural pathogen of T. molitor, and 
measured female age-specific fecundity, survival, body mass and immunity. 
Inconsistent with a terminal investment, females given either an early or 
late-life immune challenge did not exhibit reduced survival or enhance their 
reproductive output. Female fecundity declined with age and was reduced by the 
early but not the late immune challenge. Both early and late-life fecundity 
correlated positively with life expectancy. Finally, young and old females 
exhibited similar antibacterial immune responses, suggesting that they both 
restrained reproduction to sustain immunity. Our results clearly demonstrate 
that age-specific reproduction of T. molitor females under pathogenic threat is 
inconsistent with a terminal investment. In contrast, our results instead 
suggest that females used a reproductive restraint strategy to sustain immunity 
and therefore subsequent reproductive opportunities. However, as infections were 
mimicked only, the fitness benefit of this reproductive restraint could not be 
shown.

OBJECTIVES: Interventions aimed at reducing falls and physical inactivity could 
alleviate the economic burden attributable to these factors. The study aimed to 
analyze the cost-effectiveness of a group-delivered version of the 
Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise Program compared with an individually 
delivered program version.
DESIGN: An economic evaluation conducted alongside the LiFE-is-LiFE randomized 
non-inferiority trial.
INTERVENTIONS: Group and individually delivered version of a program consisting 
of strength and balance exercises integrated into everyday activities to prevent 
falls.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 309 community-dwelling older adults (aged ≥70 years) 
at risk of falling recruited around Heidelberg and Stuttgart (Germany).
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of the group program was assessed over 6 months 
using different effect measures [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs, EQ-5D-5L), 
physical activity (mean number of steps/day), and falls] and cost perspectives 
(societal and payer's). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were determined, 
and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed.
RESULTS: From a societal perspective, mean costs, the number of falls, and the 
number of steps/day were somewhat higher in the group program, whereas QALYs 
were almost identical between the 2 interventions. From the payer's perspective, 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the group compared to the 
individual program were €56,733 per QALY and €4755 per fall prevented. Based on 
the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, the cost-effectiveness of the group 
program had to be rated as uncertain for both effect measures and perspectives. 
In contrast, it demonstrated cost-effectiveness for increasing physical activity 
at willingness-to-pay values per additional 1000 steps/day of €1600 (societal 
perspective) or €600 (payer's perspective).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Compared to the individual program, the group 
program might be cost-effective for increasing physical activity in older adults 
but was unlikely to be cost-effective with regard to QALY or for preventing 
falls. The cost-effectiveness should be evaluated long-term and compared to a 
regular care group.

AIMS: Temporomandibular disorders are a cluster of orofacial conditions that are 
characterized by pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and surrounding 
muscles/tissues. Animal models of painful temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) 
are valuable tools to investigate the mechanisms responsible for symptomatic 
temporomandibular joint and associated structures disorders. We tested the 
hypothesis that a predisposing and a precipitating factor are required to 
produce painful TMD in rats, using the ratgnawmeter, a device that determines 
temporomandibular pain based on the time taken for the rat to chew through two 
obstacles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Increased time in the ratgnawmeter correlated with 
nociceptive behaviors produced by TMJ injection of formalin (2.5%), confirming 
chewing time as an index of painful TMD. Rats exposed only to predisposing 
factors, carrageenan-induced TMJ inflammation or sustained inhibition of the 
catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme by OR-486, showed no changes in 
chewing time. However, when combined with a precipitating event, i.e., 
exaggerated mouth opening produced by daily 1-h jaw extension for 7 consecutive 
days, robust function impairment was produced.
KEY FINDINGS: These results validate the ratgnawmeter as an efficient method to 
evaluate functional TMD pain by evaluating chewing time, and this protocol as a 
model with face and construct validities to investigate symptomatic TMD 
mechanisms.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that a predisposition factor must be present 
in order for an insult to the temporomandibular system to produce painful 
dysfunction. The need for a combined contribution of these factors might explain 
why not all patients experiencing traumatic events, such as exaggerated mouth 
opening, develop TMDs.

BACKGROUND: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) combine the impact of 
morbidity and mortality, allowing for comprehensive comparisons of the 
population. The aim was to estimate the DALYs due to Covid-19 in Malta (March 
2020-21) and investigate its impact in relation to other causes of disease at a 
population level.
METHODS: Mortality and weekly hospital admission data were used to calculate 
DALYs, based on the European Burden of Disease Network consensus Covid-19 model. 
Covid-19 infection duration of 14 days was considered. Sensitivity analyses for 
different morbidity scenarios, including post-acute consequences were presented.
RESULTS: An estimated 70,421 people were infected (with and without symptoms) by 
Covid-19 in Malta (March 2020-1), out of which 1636 required hospitalisation and 
331 deaths, contributing to 5478 DALYs. These DALYs positioned Covid-19 as the 
fourth leading cause of disease in Malta. Mortality contributed to 95% of DALYs, 
while post-acute consequences contributed to 60% of morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 over 1 year has impacted substantially the population 
health in Malta. Post-acute consequences are the leading morbidity factors that 
require urgent targeted action to ensure timely multidisciplinary care. It is 
recommended that DALY estimations in 2021 and beyond are calculated to assess 
the impact of vaccine roll-out and emergence of new variants.

BACKGROUND: With emerging evidence on the efficacy of adding dapagliflozin to 
standard care for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF), this study assessed the cost-effectiveness of add-on dapagliflozin to 
standard care versus standard care alone for HFrEF from the perspective of 
healthcare systems in the Asia-Pacific region.
METHODS: A Markov model was applied to project the outcomes of treatment in 
terms of lifetime medical cost and quality-adjusted life-years. The transition 
probabilities between health states in the model were obtained from the 
Dapagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction 
trial. Country-specific costs and utilities were extracted for modeling. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio against a country-specific 
willingness-to-pay threshold was applied to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
treatment. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to ensure the 
robustness of the study results. Costs are presented in 2020 United States 
dollars.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for add-on dapagliflozin 
versus standard care alone were $5277, $9980, $12,305, $16,705, and $23,227 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained in Korea, Australia, Taiwan, Japan, and 
Singapore, respectively. When using add-on dapagliflozin to standard care versus 
standard care alone, ~ 100% of simulations were cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of one gross domestic product per capita of the 
given Asia-Pacific country; however, the probability of being cost-effective for 
using add-on dapagliflozin decreased when the time horizon for simulation was 
restricted to 18 months and when the cardiovascular mortality for the two 
treatments (43.8% and 33.0%, respectively) was assumed to be the same. The 
cost-effectiveness results were most sensitive to cardiovascular mortality of 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding dapagliflozin to standard care is cost-effective for HFrEF 
in healthcare systems in the Asia-Pacific region, which supports the rational 
use of dapagliflozin for HFrEF in this region.

BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with a wide 
range of diseases, unsafe behavior and shorter life expectancy. However, there 
is scarce evidence on effective interventions for children or adolescents who 
report multiple ACEs, including abuse, neglect and household dysfunction.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the mental health outcomes of a 
multimodal program designed for adolescents with multiple ACEs.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-four girls (aged 13-16 years, mean ACE score > 5) were 
randomized to an intervention group or a care-as-usual control group.
METHODS: The intervention included mindfulness-based practices, expressive arts 
and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Integrative) group 
treatment. We used questionnaires for adolescents to assess trauma (SPRINT, 
CPSS) and attention/awareness-related outcomes (MAAS-A) at baseline (T1), 
post-intervention (T2) and two-months post-discharge (T3).
RESULTS: Linear mixed effects model analyses showed significant Group by Time 
interactions on all the scales (F = 11.0, p = 0.015; F = 12.5 p < 0.001; and 
F = 6.4, p = 0.001, for SPRINT, CPSS and MAAS-A, respectively). After completing 
the program, the intervention group showed significant reduction in 
trauma-related outcomes (SPRINT, Δ%(T2-T1) = -73%, p < 0.001; CPSS, 
Δ%(T2-T1) = -26%, p < 0.001) while attention/awareness-related outcomes were 
improved by 57% (p < 0.001). These changes remained stable two months after 
discharge. SPRINT and CPSS scales were highly correlated (r = 0.833, p < 0.001) 
and outcomes from both trauma-related scales negatively correlated with 
mindfulness scores (MAAS-A/SPRINT, r = -0.515, p = 0.007; MAAS-A/CPSS, 
r = -0.553, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Results presented here support this multimodal group intervention 
as a feasible and promising program for reducing the psychological burden in 
adolescents with a history of multiple ACEs.

The incidence of rare diseases is approximately two cases per 10,000 people. 
Today, in most cases, orphan diseases are caused by genetic disorders, less 
often - some forms of oncological, oncohematological, infectious disorders. 
These conditions have a severe and chronic course, accompanied by a decrease in 
quality and a reduction in the life expectancy of patients. Aim - describe a 
clinical case of an rare disease that is referred to as Zellweger spectrum 
disorders. Literature review and analysis of clinical-anamnestic and 
laboratory-instrumental methods of research of a 6.5 years old girl. The given 
clinical case, namely Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSD), is a hereditary 
autosomal recessive disease characterized by nonspecific clinical manifestations 
and phenotype, which complicates timely diagnosis and delays symptomatic, and in 
some cases prognostically favorable treatment. Molecular genetic research makes 
it possible to finally confirm this disease. Therefore, at the slightest 
suspicion of this pathology, it is worth investigating the level of long-chain 
fatty acids, plasmalogen of erythrocytes, intermediate metabolites of bile acid 
synthesis, or carrying out genetic sequencing. Further studies of this condition 
are carried out in the world in order to obtain new methods of treatment and 
improve the quality of life of patients. The presented clinical case of a rare 
disease, which belongs to ZSD, confirms the need for alertness of family doctors 
and pediatricians in order to timely diagnose and correct rare diseases in 
children.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease with an 
increasing incidence associated with increased life expectancy. The application 
of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of OA has become a research 
hotspot.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of XGS externally applied to 
osteoarthritic joints and analyze its effect on pain in monosodium iodoacetate 
(MIA)-induced OA rats. This study also evaluates potential mechanisms behind the 
anti-osteoarthritic effects of XGS.
METHODS: A total of 24 Sprague Dawley rats were evenly and randomly divided into 
three separate groups, including the normal control (NC), OA and XGS groups. MIA 
(50 μL, 10 mg/mL) was injected into the left knee joints of the rats to induce 
OA. After 7 days, The rats of XGS group were given XGS (0.45 g) that was 
externally applied to the left knee joint, were fixed with gauze, and 
continuously administered XGS for 28 days. Morphological changes in tissues and 
organs were examined using H&E staining. Biochemical indicators were measured 
using an automatic biochemical analyzer. Inflammatory cytokines were detected 
using ELISA kits and immunohistochemistry. RNA-based high-throughput sequencing 
(RNA-seq) was performed to detect differential expression of mRNAs in normal and 
MIA-induced OA rats.
RESULTS: Stride of the left leg was extended in rats, matrix increased on 
cartilage tissue surfaces, and inflammatory cytokines were reduced when treated 
with XGS. RNA-seq results revealed that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is 
activated in the OA model. The qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of Tnn, 
Col6a6, Igf1 and Lamb1 were up-regulated by XGS.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, this work demonstrated the potential therapeutic effects 
of XGS in rats with OA induced by MIA. The XGS may be considered an alternative 
therapy to manage OA.

BACKGROUND: A greater understanding of the factors that are associated with 
favourable health may help increase longevity and healthy life expectancy. We 
examined sociodemographic, psychosocial, lifestyle and environmental exposures 
associated with multiple health indicators.
METHODS: UK Biobank recruited > 500,000 participants, aged 37-73, between 2006 
and 2010. Health indicators examined were 81 cancer and 443 non-cancer illnesses 
used to classify participants' health status; long-standing illness; and 
self-rated health. Exposures were sociodemographic (age, sex, ethnicity, 
education, income and deprivation), psychosocial (loneliness and social 
isolation), lifestyle (smoking, alcohol intake, sleep duration, BMI, physical 
activity and stair climbing) and environmental (air pollution, noise and 
residential greenspace) factors. Associations were estimated using logistic and 
ordinal logistic regression.
RESULTS: In total, 307,378 participants (mean age = 56.1 years [SD = 8.07], 
51.9% female) were selected for cross-sectional analyses. Low income, being 
male, neighbourhood deprivation, loneliness, social isolation, short or long 
sleep duration, low or high BMI and smoking were associated with poor health. 
Walking, vigorous-intensity physical activity and more frequent alcohol intake 
were associated with good health. There was some evidence that airborne 
pollutants (PM2.5, PM10 and NO2) and noise (Lden) were associated with poor 
health, though findings were not consistent across all models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the multifactorial nature of health, the 
importance of non-medical factors, such as loneliness, healthy lifestyle 
behaviours and weight management, and the need to examine efforts to improve the 
health outcomes of individuals on low incomes.

Since 2013, the process of pricing of innovative drugs by the French National 
Health Insurance has considered both cost-effectiveness and budget impact. CAR-T 
cell therapies were first subject to economic evaluation from 2019 in France. We 
aim to describe the process and results of the economic evaluation of 
tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel as well as the challenges these 
evaluations raised. Evaluations submitted by the firms were reviewed by HAS and 
submitted to the Committee of Economic Evaluation and Public Health (CEESP). The 
CEESP issued opinions related to: (1) the methodological quality of economic 
evidence and, (2) the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the drugs. The 
CEESP invalidated the estimated incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) of 
tisagenlecleucel due to the insufficient clinical evidence and methodological 
quality to extrapolate the long-term progression of the disease after treatment 
and compare tisagenlecleucel with alternatives. The CEESP concluded that 
tisagenlecleucel was not proven cost-effective. The estimated ICUR of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel at €114,509/QALY vs. chemotherapies was associated with 
an acceptable level of methodological quality despite being based on a weak 
indirect comparison and limited data on quality of life. The CEESP considered 
axicabtagene ciloleucel ICUR to be "very high" and questioned the 
societal/community willingness-to-pay of the claimed price. The primary source 
of uncertainty surrounding the ICUR estimates of both drugs was the lack of 
hindsight on effectiveness. The economic evaluation of CAR-T cell therapies 
highlights the risk of inefficient resource allocation driven by limited 
clinical data. It calls for payment schemes accounting for this risk and 
effective collection of post-marketing data.

Estimation of Utility Values for Computing Quality-adjusted Life Years 
Associated With Homelessness.

Affairs Central Office, Tampa, FL.

BACKGROUND: There is a lack of data-driven evidence about the burden of 
homelessness, and lack of a holistic measure of effectiveness for evaluating 
interventions targeting homelessness. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) can 
help holistically capture the burden of homelessness, and facilitate the 
valuation and comparison of interventions designed to address homelessness.
OBJECTIVE: This study estimated utility values required to compute the QALYs 
associated with homelessness, and also examined individual-level characteristics 
that affect these values.
RESEARCH DESIGN: The study is cross-sectional and derived from a large national 
survey conducted during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
SUBJECTS: A sample of 6607 middle- and low-income adults in the United States.
MEASURES: A self-completion standard gamble survey was used to estimate utility 
values associated with homelessness. Linear regression was used to analyze the 
association between individual-level characteristics and these utility values.
RESULTS: The study estimated the average utility value associated with 
homelessness as 43.4% among the study participants. This implies that 1 year of 
life as a homeless individual is perceived to be equivalent to less than half a 
year of life as a stably housed individual in good health. The study also found 
that individuals who have experienced homelessness and financial distress value 
life as a homeless person considerably less than those who have not had these 
experiences.
CONCLUSIONS: The method developed in this study can be used to estimate QALYs in 
studies evaluating homelessness interventions, thereby establishing the societal 
value of these interventions and informing policy and budgetary decision-making. 
Future studies estimating the utility values associated with homelessness in the 
general population, as well as specific homeless groups, are required to provide 
more generalizable evidence.

The human gut microbiome has been extensively studied, but its diversity scaling 
(changes or heterogeneities) along the digestive tract (DT) as well as their 
inter-individual heterogeneities have not been adequately addressed to the best 
of our knowledge. Here we fill the gap by applying the diversity-area 
relationship (DAR), a recent extension to the classic species-area relationship 
(SAR) in biogeography, by reanalyzing a dataset of over 2000 16s-rRNA microbiome 
samples obtained from 10 DT sites of over 200 individuals. We sketched out the 
biogeography "maps" for each of the 10 DT sites by cross-individual DAR 
analysis, and the intra-DT distribution pattern by cross-DT-site DAR analysis. 
Regarding the inter-individual biogeography, it was found that all DT sites have 
the invariant (constant) scaling parameter-all sites possessing the same 
diversity change rate across individuals, but most sites have different 
potential diversities, which include the portions of diversity that may be 
absent locally but present regionally. In the case of this study, the potential 
diversity of each DT site covers the total diversity of the respective site from 
all individuals in the cohort. In terms of the genus richness, an average 
individual hosts approximately 20% of the population-level genus richness (total 
bacterial genus of a human population). In contrast, in terms of community 
biodiversity, the percentages of individual over population may exceed 90%. This 
suggests that the differences between individuals in their DT microbiomes are 
predominantly in the composition of bacterial species, rather than how their 
abundances are distributed (i.e., biodiversity). Regarding the intra-DT 
patterns, the scaling parameter (z) is larger-suggesting that the intra-DT 
biodiversity changes are larger than inter-individual changes. The higher 
intra-DT heterogeneity of bacteria diversity, as suggested by larger intra-DT z 
than the inter-individual heterogeneity, should be expected since the intra-DT 
heterogeneity reflects the functional differentiations of the DT tract, while 
the inter-individual heterogeneity (z) reflects the difference of the same DT 
site across individuals. On average, each DT site contains 21-36% of the genus 
diversity of the whole DT, and the percentages are even higher in terms of 
higher taxon levels.

Marine mammals vary greatly in size and lifespan across species. This study 
determined whether measures of adult body weight, length and relative telomere 
length were related to lifespan. Skin tissue samples (n = 338) were obtained 
from 23 marine mammal species, including four Mysticeti, 19 Odontoceti and one 
dugong species, and the DNA extracted to measure relative telomere length using 
real-time PCR. Life span, adult body weight, and adult body length of each 
species were retrieved from existing databases. The phylogenetic signal analysis 
revealed that body length might be a significant factor for shaping evolutionary 
processes of cetacean species through time, especially for genus Balaenoptera 
that have an enormous size. Further, our study found correlations between 
lifespan and adult body weight (R 2 = 0.6465, p < 0.001) and adult body length 
(R 2 = 0.6142, p ≤0.001), but no correlations with relative telomere length (R 2 
= -0.0476, p = 0.9826). While data support our hypothesis that larger marine 
mammals live longer, relative telomere length is not a good predictor of species 
longevity.
