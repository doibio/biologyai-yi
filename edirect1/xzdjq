BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal vaccination policy for US adults is evolving, but 
previous research has shown that programs to increase vaccine uptake are 
economically favorable, despite parameter uncertainty. Using value of 
information (VOI) analysis and prior analyses, we examine the value of further 
research on vaccine uptake program parameters.
METHODS: In US 50-64-year-olds, current vaccine recommendations with and without 
an uptake program were analyzed. In older adults, current recommendations and an 
alternative strategy (polysaccharide vaccine for all, adding conjugate vaccine 
only for the immunocompromised) with and without uptake programs were examined. 
Uptake program parameters were derived from a clinical trial (absolute uptake 
increase 12.3% [range 0-25%], per-person cost $1.78 [range $0.70-$2.26]), with 
other parameters obtained from US databases. VOI analyses incorporated 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis outputs into R-based regression techniques.
RESULTS: In 50-64-year-olds, an uptake program cost $54,900/QALY gained compared 
to no uptake program. For ages ≥65, the program cost $287,000/QALY gained with 
the alternative strategy and $765,000/QALY with current recommendations. In 
younger adults, population-level expected value of perfect information (EVPI) 
was $59.7 million at $50,000/QALY gained and $2.8 million at $100,000/QALY 
gained. In older adults, EVPI values ranged from ~$1 million to $34.5 million at 
$100,000 and $200,000/QALY thresholds. The population expected value of partial 
perfect information (EVPPI) for combined uptake program cost and uptake 
improvement parameters in the younger population was $368,700 at $50,000/QALY 
and $43,900 at $100,000/QALY gained thresholds. In older adults, population 
EVPPI for vaccine uptake program parameters was $0 at both thresholds, reaching 
a maximum value of $445,000 at a $225,000/QALY threshold. Other model parameters 
comprised larger components of the global EVPI.
CONCLUSION: VOI results do not support further research on pneumococcal vaccine 
uptake programs in adults at commonly cited US cost-effectiveness benchmarks. 
Further research to reduce uncertainty in other aspects of adult pneumococcal 
vaccination is justifiable.

BACKGROUND: The in vivo kinematic benefit of an asymmetrical polyethylene insert 
is still unknown in comparison with that of a symmetrical insert with the same 
femoral component design. The purpose of this study was to analyze the kinematic 
differences between symmetrical and asymmetrical polyethylene inserts and to 
detect the kinematic benefit in the asymmetrical polyethylene insert. The 
hypotheses are that greater axial rotation and more posterior rollback are 
observed in the asymmetrical polyethylene insert.
METHODS: The patients were randomly allocated to the following two groups: total 
knee arthroplasty with a symmetrical insert and with an asymmetrical insert. 
In vivo knee kinematics was analyzed in asymmetrical (17 knees) and symmetrical 
(16 knees) inserts using an image matching technique. The symmetrical 
polyethylene insert had the same geometry on both sides, whereas the 
asymmetrical polyethylene insert had a flat surface on the postero-lateral side. 
The anterior/posterior position and axial rotation were compared between the two 
polyethylene inserts.
RESULTS: The femoral component was significantly positioned posteriorly at 70° 
(p = 0.016) and 80° (p = 0.040) of knee flexion and externally rotated at 80° of 
knee flexion (p = 0.040) in the asymmetrical polyethylene insert as compared to 
the position of the symmetrical polyethylene insert. Femoral rollback and axial 
rotation from full extension to maximum flexion were greater in the asymmetrical 
polyethylene insert, although the difference was not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In the asymmetrical polyethylene insert, slight kinematic benefit 
with greater axial rotation and more posterior rollback was observed in 
comparison with the symmetrical polyethylene insert. Further research should be 
required whether the kinematic benefit of an asymmetrical polyethylene insert 
will lead to better patient satisfaction and function.

Factors which indicate lower life expectancy also induce switching to a faster 
life strategy, that is, a higher investment in current reproduction at the 
expense of future reproduction and body maintenance. We tested a hypothesis 
according to which impairment of individual health serves as a signal for 
switching to a faster life strategy using online-gathered data from 32,911 
subjects. Worse health was associated with lower age at menarche and earlier 
initiation of sexual life in women and higher sexual desire and earlier 
reproduction in both sexes. Individuals with worse health also exhibited lower 
sexual activity, lower number of sexual partners, and lower total number of 
children. These results suggest that impaired health shifts individuals towards 
a faster life strategy but also has a negative (physiological) effect on 
behaviours related to sexual life. Signs of a faster life strategy were also 
found in Rh-negative men in good health, indicating that even just genetic 
predisposition to worse health could serve as a signal for switching to a faster 
life strategy. We suggest that improved public health in developed countries and 
the resulting shift to a slower life strategy could be the ultimate cause of the 
phenomenon of demographic transition.

Against the background of increasing life expectancy over time, several 
hypotheses have been proposed on the way morbidity has been developing. In type 
2 diabetes (T2D), previous research suggests that morbidity compression could be 
ruled out due to increasing prevalence and life expectancy with T2D over time. 
Understanding how the health state in individuals with T2D is developing would 
help identify whether morbidity expansion or a dynamic equilibrium pattern 
applies for this disease. This study aims to answer the following questions: (1) 
How do the number and the prevalence of T2D concordant comorbidities develop 
over time? (2) What does this imply in terms of morbidity development in T2D in 
Germany? The study used claims data from a statutory health insurance provider 
in Lower Saxony, Germany. Period prevalence of T2D concordant comorbidities was 
examined for the periods 2005-2007, 2010-2012 and 2015-2017 in 240,241, 295,868 
and 308,134 individuals with T2D respectively. The effect of time period on the 
number and prevalence of comorbidities was examined by means of (ordered) 
logistic regression. The age-adjusted predicted probabilities of more severe 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) decreased over the three periods while those of 
less severe CVDs and other vascular diseases increased significantly in men and 
women and among all examined age-groups. Predicted probability of having at 
least one more comorbidity over time also increased significantly among all 
examined groups. While less and more severe CVDs exhibited different 
developmental patterns, the results of the study point towards morbidity 
expansion in T2D. Future studies should focus on mechanisms that contribute to 
these trends.

Through assignment method, the total score of disability in multiple dimensions 
is obtained, and it is divided into five functional states-severe disability, 
partial disability, moderate disability, mild disability, and health-according 
to the score, and the probability of death is constructed. Using the Chinese 
Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) database tracking survey data, by 
constructing a multistate transition probability matrix, the empirical 
calculation of the multistate disability transfer probability, with the help of 
the sixth national census data, we estimated maintenance time of each state, 
life expectancy, etc. The results show that the 3 year transfer probability of 
the initial healthy elderly is the highest, and the mortality rate is also the 
lowest. It can be found that the disability state transition probability 
measurement based on the data is more accurate than the model estimation; the 
disability scale and life expectancy estimated based on the multistate 
transition probability matrix are more reliable.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a widespread genetic disease associated with severe 
disability and multi-organ damage, resulting in a reduced life expectancy. None 
of the existing clinical treatments provide a solution for all patients. Gene 
therapy and fetal haemoglobin (HbF) reactivation through genetic approaches have 
obtained promising, but early, results in patients. Furthermore, the search for 
active molecules to increase HbF is still ongoing. The delta-globin gene 
produces the delta-globin of haemoglobin A2 (HbA2). Although expressed at a low 
level, HbA2 is fully functional and could be a valid anti-sickling agent in SCD. 
To evaluate the therapeutic potential of a strategy aimed to over-express the 
delta-globin gene in vivo, we crossed transgenic mice carrying a single copy of 
the delta-globin gene, genetically modified to be expressed at a higher level 
(activated), with a humanised mouse model of SCD. The activated delta-globin 
gene gives rise to a consistent production of HbA2, effectively improving the 
SCD phenotype. For the first time in vivo, these results demonstrate the 
therapeutic potential of delta-globin, which could lead to novel approaches to 
the cure of SCD.

Patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer often suffer from 
malnutrition, which can have an impact on quality of life, increase the toxicity 
of chemotherapy and reduce overall survival. Options available to the clinician 
to manage a patient's nutritional status include screening and assessment of 
malnutrition at diagnosis, monitoring during the 'cancer journey', early 
detection of precachexia and the ongoing use of a multidisciplinary team 
(oncologists, other medical specialists and nutritionists). Because malnutrition 
is frequently overlooked and under treated in patients with advanced or 
metastatic gastric cancer, this narrative review focuses on the clinical meaning 
of nutritional status in gastric cancer and provides general guidance regarding 
nutritional care management for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric 
cancer.

Plain Language Summary: Lay abstract Patients with gastric cancer that has 
spread to other parts of the body often suffer from malnutrition. This can 
impact patients’ lives, increase side effects from cancer treatment and reduce 
life expectancy. This article provides guidance for healthcare providers on 
nutritional care for patients with gastric cancer. Key ways healthcare providers 
can contribute to nutritional care include: looking for malnutrition when a 
patient is diagnosed with gastric cancer; watching carefully for malnutrition 
during cancer treatment; keeping a lookout for early signs of extreme weight 
loss and muscle wasting; and involving a team of healthcare providers with a 
broad range of expertise in patients’ nutritional care.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of high dose genistein 
aglycone in Sanfilippo syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type III). High doses of 
genistein aglycone have been shown to correct neuropathology and hyperactive 
behaviour in mice, but efficacy in humans is uncertain. This was a single 
centre, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled study with open-label 
extension phase. Randomised participants received either 160 mg/kg/day genistein 
aglycone or placebo for 12 months; subsequently all participants received 
genistein for 12 months. The primary outcome measure was the change in heparan 
sulfate concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with secondary outcome 
measures including heparan sulfate in plasma and urine, total glycosaminoglycans 
in urine, cognitive and adaptive behaviour scores, quality of life measures and 
actigraphy. Twenty-one participants were randomised and 20 completed the 
placebo-controlled phase. After 12 months of treatment, the CSF heparan sulfate 
concentration was 5.5% lower in the genistein group (adjusted for baseline 
values), but this was not statistically significant (P = .26), and CSF heparan 
sulfate increased in both groups during the open-label extension phase. 
Reduction of urinary glycosaminoglycans was significantly greater in the 
genistein group (32.1% lower than placebo after 12 months, P = .0495). Other 
biochemical and clinical parameters showed no significant differences between 
groups. High dose genistein aglycone (160 mg/kg/day) was not associated with 
clinically meaningful reductions in CSF heparan sulfate and no evidence of 
clinical efficacy was detected. However, there was a statistically significant 
reduction in urine glycosaminoglycans. These data do not support the use of 
genistein aglycone therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis type III. High dose 
genistein aglycone does not lead to clinically meaningful reductions in 
biomarkers or improvement in neuropsychological outcomes in 
mucopolysaccharidosis type III.

IMPORTANCE: More than half of the adult population in the United States has ever 
had a family member incarcerated, an experience more common among Black 
individuals. The impacts of family incarceration on well-being are not fully 
understood.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the associations of incarceration of a family member with 
perceived well-being and differences in projected life expectancy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationally representative 
cross-sectional study used data from the 2018 Family History of Incarceration 
Survey to examine how experiences of family member incarceration were associated 
with a holistic measure of well-being, including physical, mental, social, 
financial, and spiritual domains. Well-being was used to estimate change in life 
expectancy and was compared across varying levels of exposure to immediate and 
extended family member incarceration using logistic regression models to adjust 
for individual and household characteristics. Data were analyzed from October 
2019 to April 2020.
EXPOSURES: Respondents' history of family member incarceration, including 
immediate and extended family members.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was self-reported life-evaluation, 
a measure of overall well-being from the 100 Million Healthier Lives Adult 
Well-being Assessment. Respondents were considered thriving with a current life 
satisfaction score of 7 or greater and a future life optimism score of 8 or 
greater, each on a scale of 0 to 10. Other outcomes included physical health, 
mental health, social support, financial well-being, and spiritual well-being, 
each measured with separate scales. Additionally, life expectancy projections 
were estimated using population-level correlations with the Life Evaluation 
Index. All percentages were weighted to more closely represent the US 
population.
RESULTS: Of 2815 individuals included in analysis, 1472 (51.7%) were women, 1765 
(62.8%) were non-Hispanic White, and 868 (31.5%) were aged 35 to 54 years. A 
total of 1806 respondents (45.0%) reported having an immediate family member who 
was incarcerated. Compared with respondents with no family incarceration, any 
family member incarceration was associated with lower well-being overall 
(thriving: 69.5% [95% CI, 65.0%-75.0%] vs 56.9% [95% CI, 53.9%-59.9%]) and in 
every individual domain (eg, physical thriving: 51.1% [95% CI, 46.2-56.0] vs 
35.5% [95% CI, 32.6%-38.3%]) and with a mean (SE) estimated 2.6 (0.03) years 
shorter life expectancy. Among those with any family incarceration, Black 
respondents had a mean (SE) estimated 0.46 (0.04) fewer years of life expectancy 
compared with White respondents.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that family member health and 
well-being may be an important avenue through which incarceration is associated 
with racial disparities in health and mortality. Decarceration efforts may 
improve population-level well-being and life expectancy by minimizing 
detrimental outcomes associated with incarceration among nonincarcerated family 
members.

Botryosphaeria dothidea is one of the most important diseases which can cause 
poplar canker. In our previous study, the endophytic Bacillus subtilis N6-34 
screened from poplar tissue was found to be an antagonistic strain against B. 
dothidea. In order to ascertain the colonization rule of B. subtilis N6-34 in 
poplar plants, colonization of B. subtilis N6-34 labeled with a green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) was investigated in poplar plants and the rhizosphere 
soil. To confirm the inhibitory effect of the strain N6-34 on pathogenic fungi, 
real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR experiment with Fusarium oxysporum as the 
target strain was carried out. Firstly, a plasmid (pHT01-P43GFPmut3a) containing 
gfp gene was successfully transformed into wild B. subtilis N6-34, which has the 
similar characteristics with the strain N6-34 in cell growth and antifungal 
activity. The poplar pot experiments were carried out to examine the 
colonization rules and colonization quantity in poplar plants and rhizosphere 
soil. Observation with a confocal laser scanning microscope showed that 
GFP-labeled B. subtilis N6-34 (N6-34-GFP) could colonize in primary root, 
lateral root and adventitious root. With the extension of inoculation time, the 
colonization quantity of N6-34-GFP in the rhizosphere soil and poplar plants 
showed a trend of first increasing, then stabilizing for a period of time and 
then decreasing. The real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR result showed a 
gradual decrease in the number of F. oxysporum with increasing inoculation time. 
Therefore, N6-34-GFP exhibited colonization in the rhizosphere soil and 
different parts of poplar plants. In addition, the strain N6-34 could inhibit 
the growth of pathogenic fungi. The ability of B. subtilis N6-34 to colonize in 
the rhizosphere soil and poplar plants and to inhibit fungal growth in vitro 
suggest a potential application of this strain as a biological control agent.

BACKGROUND: The effect of nanoemulsions prepared with grape seed and cinnamon 
essential oils on the shelf-life of flathead mullet (Mugil cephalus) fillets was 
evaluated by determining physicochemical (pH, free fatty acids, peroxide value, 
total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), and thiobarbituric acid reactive 
substances (TBARs)), sensory and microbiological (mesophilic aerobic bacteria, 
total psychrophilic bacteria, and Enterobacteriaceae counts) properties during 
14 day storage at 2 °C.
RESULTS: The nanoemulsions showed good stability and low average droplet size. 
The results indicated that nanoemulsion treatments significantly prolonged the 
shelf-life of the fillets. Treatment inhibited increases in pH and TVB-N, and 
retarded lipid oxidation and hydrolysis. Sensory assessment revealed that 
treatment induced shelf-life extension from 10 to 14 days, compared with 
controls. Microbiological analyses showed nanoemulsion treatment caused 
shelf-life extension from 10 to 12 days with reduction of microbiological 
contamination by up to 1 log cfu g-1 in mesophilic and 1.5 log cfu g-1 in 
psychrotrophic bacteria.
CONCLUSION: Considering the results, grape seed and cinnamon essential oil 
nanoemulsions could be considered as novel antimicrobial and antioxidant 
materials for shelf-life extension of flathead mullet fillets during cold 
storage. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid shift from center-based 
rehabilitation to telerehabilitation for chronic respiratory disease and lung 
transplantation due to infection control precautions. Clinical experience with 
this delivery model on a large scale has not been described.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe usage and satisfaction of 
providers and lung transplant (LTx) candidates and recipients and functional 
outcomes following the broad implementation of telerehabilitation with remote 
patient monitoring during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: This study was a program evaluation of providers, LTx candidates, and 
early LTx recipients who used a web-based, remote monitoring app for at least 
four weeks between March 16 and September 1, 2020, to participate in 
telerehabilitation. Within-subjects analysis was performed for physical 
activity, Self-efficacy For Exercise (SEE) scale score, aerobic and resistance 
exercise volumes, 6-minute walk test results, and Short Physical Performance 
Battery (SPPB) results.
RESULTS: In total, 78 LTx candidates and 33 recipients were included (57 [51%] 
males, mean age 58 [SD 12] years, 58 [52%] with interstitial lung disease, 34 
[31%] with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). A total of 50 (64%) LTx 
candidates and 17 (51%) LTx recipients entered ≥10 prescribed exercise sessions 
into the app during the study time frame. In addition, 35/42 (83%) candidates 
agreed the app helped prepare them for surgery and 18/21 (85%) recipients found 
the app helpful in their self-recovery. The strongest barrier perceived by 
physiotherapists delivering the telerehabilitation was patient access to home 
exercise and monitoring equipment. Between the time of app registration and ≥4 
weeks on the waiting list, 26 LTx candidates used a treadmill, with sessions 
increasing in mean duration (from 16 to 22 minutes, P=.002) but not speed (from 
1.7 to 1.75 mph, P=.31). Quadriceps weight (pounds) for leg extension did not 
change (median 3.5, IQR 2.4-5 versus median 4.3, IQR 3-5; P=.08; n=37). On the 
Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity questionnaire (RAPA), 57% of LTx 
candidates scored as active, which improved to 87% (P=.02; n=23). There was a 
decrease in pretransplant 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from 346 (SD 84) meters 
to 307 (SD 85) meters (P=.002; n=45) and no change in the SPPB result (12 [IQR 
9.5-12] versus 12 [IQR 10-12]; P=.90; n=42). A total of 9 LTx recipients used a 
treadmill that increased in speed (from 1.9 to 2.7 mph; P=.003) between hospital 
discharge and three months posttransplant. Quadriceps weight increased (3 [IQR 
0-3] pounds versus 5 [IQR 3.8-6.5] pounds; P<.001; n=15). At three months 
posttransplant, 76% of LTx recipients scored as active (n=17), with a high total 
SEE score of 74 (SD 11; n=12). In addition, three months posttransplant, 6MWD 
was 62% (SD 18%) predicted (n=8).
CONCLUSIONS: We were able to provide telerehabilitation despite challenges 
around exercise equipment. This early experience will inform the development of 
a robust and equitable telerehabilitation model beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

While a substantial amount of literature addresses the relationship between 
natural resources and economic growth, relatively little is known regarding the 
relationship between natural resource endowment and health at the population 
level. We construct a 5-year cross-country panel to assess the impact of natural 
resource rents on changes in life expectancy at birth as a proxy indicator for 
population health during the period 1970-2015. To estimate the causal effects of 
interest, we use global commodity prices as instrumental variables for natural 
resource rent incomes in two-stage-least squares regressions. Controlling for 
country and year fixed effects, we show that each standard deviation increase in 
resource rents results in life expectancy increase of 6.72% (CI: 2.01%, 11.44%). 
This corresponds to approximately one additional year of life expectancy gained 
over five years. We find a larger positive effect of rents on life expectancy in 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared to other world regions. We do not find 
short-term effects of rents on economic growth, but show that increases in 
resource rents result in sizeable increases in government revenues in the short 
run, which likely translate into increased spending across government sectors. 
This suggests that natural resources can help governments finance health and 
other development-oriented programs needed to improve population health.

The efficient and accurate calculation of how ionic quantum and thermal 
fluctuations impact the free energy of a crystal, its atomic structure, and 
phonon spectrum is one of the main challenges of solid state physics, especially 
when strong anharmonicy invalidates any perturbative approach. To tackle this 
problem, we present the implementation on a modular Python code of the 
stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) method. This technique 
rigorously describes the full thermodynamics of crystals accounting for nuclear 
quantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations. The approach requires the 
evaluation of the Born-Oppenheimer energy, as well as its derivatives with 
respect to ionic positions (forces) and cell parameters (stress tensor) in 
supercells, which can be provided, for instance, by first principles 
density-functional-theory codes. The method performs crystal geometry relaxation 
on the quantum free energy landscape, optimizing the free energy with respect to 
all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure. It can be used to determine the 
phase diagram of any crystal at finite temperature. It enables the calculation 
of phase boundaries for both first-order and second-order phase transitions from 
the Hessian of the free energy. Finally, the code can also compute the 
anharmonic phonon spectra, including the phonon linewidths, as well as phonon 
spectral functions. We review the theoretical framework of the SSCHA and its 
dynamical extension, making particular emphasis on the physical inter pretation 
of the variables present in the theory that can enlighten the comparison with 
any other anharmonic theory. A modular and flexible Python environment is used 
for the implementation, which allows for a clean interaction with other 
packages. We briefly present a toy-model calculation to illustrate the potential 
of the code. Several applications of the method in superconducting hydrides, 
charge-density-wave materials, and thermoelectric compounds are also reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis japonica remains an important public health concern 
due to its potential to cause severe outcomes and long-term sequelae. An 
integrated control strategy implemented in the Peoples' Republic of China has 
been shown to be effective to control or interrupt the transmission of 
schistosomiasis. The objective of this study is to estimate the disease burden 
of schistosomiasis and assess the cost-effectiveness of the integrated control 
strategy focused on different major interventions at three stages for 
schistosomiasis control in a lake setting, to provide reference for policy 
making or planning.
METHODS: Annual cost data of schistosomiasis control during 2009-2019 were 
obtained from the control program implementers in Jiangling County, Hubei 
Province, China. Economic costs are provided in constant 2009 Chinese Yuan 
(CNY). Epidemiological data of schistosomiasis were collected from the Jiangling 
county station for schistosomiasis control. Disease burden of schistosomiasis 
was assessed by calculating years of life lost (YLLs) owing to premature death, 
years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 
DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. We then conducted a 
rudimentary cost-effectiveness analysis by determining the ratio by dividing the 
difference between the average cost of integrated control strategy at 
transmission control (2013-2016) or transmission interruption (2017-2019) and 
the average cost at stage of infection control (2009-2012) with the difference 
between the DALYs of schistosomiasis at different control stages. Descriptive 
statistics on the costs and DALYs were used in the analysis.
RESULTS: The total economic costs for schistosomiasis control in Jiangling 
County from 2009 to 2019 were approximately CNY 606.88 million. The average 
annual economic costs for schistosomiasis prevention and control at stages of 
infection control (2009-2012), transmission control (2013-2016), and 
transmission interruption (2017-2019) were approximately CNY 41.98 million, CNY 
90.19 million and CNY 26.06 million respectively. The overall disease burden 
caused by schistosomiasis presented a downward trend. Meanwhile, the disease 
burden of advanced cases showed an upward trend with the DALY increased from 
943.72 to 1031.59 person-years. Most disease burden occurred in the age group 
over 45 years old (especially the elderly over 60 years old). Taking the 
infection control stage as the control, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of integrated control strategy was CNY 8505.5 per case averted, CNY 60 131.6 per 
DALY decreased at transmission control stage and CNY -2217.6 per case averted, 
CNY -18 116.0 per DALY decreased at transmission interruption stage.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of schistosomiasis decreased significantly with 
the implementation of the integrated prevention and control strategy. 
Surveillance and management on elder population should be strengthened to 
decrease diseases burden. There remains a need for well-conducted studies that 
examine the long-term cost-effectiveness of the integrated control strategy for 
schistosomiasis. GRAPHIC ABSTARCT.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: With increased life expectancy, the incidence of 
colorectal cancer in oldest-old patients has been rising. Advanced age is a risk 
factor for adverse outcomes after surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the 
short- and long-term outcomes of curative resection for colorectal cancer in 
nonagenarians.
METHODS: Patients who had undergone curative resection for colorectal cancer 
(CRC) at Stage I to III from January 2010 to December 2019 were included. Cases 
of emergent surgery were excluded. The clinical characteristics were documented 
retrospectively, and factors affecting the long-term outcome were analyzed using 
multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Fifty patients met the selection criteria. Most of them were women 
(58.0%), and the median age was 92 years. Among these patients, 29 (58.0%) had a 
poor performance status (ASA-PS≥3). Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 42.0% 
of the patients, and 50% of the patients had postoperative complications 
classified as Clavien-Dindo grade 2 or severer, including 3 patients (6.0%) with 
grade 3 disease. No postoperative mortality occurred. The 30-day, 180-day, 
1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 100%, 80.4%, 71.0%, 46.3%, and 
33.8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that a preoperative poor 
performance status (ASA-PS≥3) (HR: 3.067; 95% CI: 1.220-7.709; p = 0.017) was an 
independent prognostic factor for OS.
CONCLUSION: Curative elective resections for CRC in nonagenarians were performed 
safely without postoperative mortality. The preoperative performance status was 
significantly associated with OS after curative elective resection of colorectal 
cancer in nonagenarians. Our results suggest that excellent long-term outcomes 
can be achieved in a selected group with a good performance status.

Aging leads to a gradual decline in physical activity and disrupted energy 
homeostasis. The NAD+-dependent SIRT6 deacylase regulates aging and metabolism 
through mechanisms that largely remain unknown. Here, we show that SIRT6 
overexpression leads to a reduction in frailty and lifespan extension in both 
male and female B6 mice. A combination of physiological assays, in vivo 
multi-omics analyses and 13C lactate tracing identified an age-dependent decline 
in glucose homeostasis and hepatic glucose output in wild type mice. In 
contrast, aged SIRT6-transgenic mice preserve hepatic glucose output and glucose 
homeostasis through an improvement in the utilization of two major gluconeogenic 
precursors, lactate and glycerol. To mediate these changes, mechanistically, 
SIRT6 increases hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression, de novo NAD+ synthesis, 
and systemically enhances glycerol release from adipose tissue. These findings 
show that SIRT6 optimizes energy homeostasis in old age to delay frailty and 
preserve healthy aging.

In 2017, we released GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) 
webserver to facilitate the widely used analyses based on the bulk gene 
expression datasets in the TCGA and the GTEx projects, providing the biologists 
and clinicians with a handy tool to perform comprehensive and complex data 
mining tasks. Recently, the deconvolution tools have led to revolutionary trends 
to resolve bulk RNA datasets at cell type-level resolution, interrogating the 
characteristics of different cell types in cancer and controlled cohorts became 
an important strategy to investigate the biological questions. Thus, we present 
GEPIA2021, a standalone extension of GEPIA, allowing users to perform multiple 
interactive analysis based on the deconvolution results, including cell 
type-level proportion comparison, correlation analysis, differential expression, 
and survival analysis. With GEPIA2021, experimental biologists could easily 
explore the large TCGA and GTEx datasets and validate their hypotheses in an 
enhanced resolution. GEPIA2021 is publicly accessible at 
http://gepia2021.cancer-pku.cn/.
