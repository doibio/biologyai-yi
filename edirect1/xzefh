PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a very 
low-protein diet (VLPD) supplemented with ketoanalogues of essential amino acids 
compared with a conventional low-protein diet (LPD) in Vietnam.
METHODS: The study was conducted from payer (base case), patient, and societal 
perspectives. A Markov model simulated costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) for patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4 or 5 (CKD4+) who were 
followed up during their lifetimes. Patients received a VLPD (0.3- to 0.4-g/kg/d 
diet) supplemented with ketoanalogues (5 kg/d [1 tablet]) versus LPD (0.6 
g/kg/d, mixed proteins). In each model cycle, patient transitions among the 
health states-CKD4+ (nondialysis), dialysis, and death-were based on transition 
probabilities taken from the published literature. The time horizon covered the 
cohort's lifetime. Utilities and costs were estimated from literature review and 
projected for the lifespan considered in the model. Probabilistic and 
deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed.
FINDINGS: The ketoanalogue-supplemented VLPD increased survival and QALYs 
compared with the LPD. From a payer's perspective, total cost of care in Vietnam 
was ₫216,854,268 (€8684/$9242) per patient with LPD versus ₫200,928,819 
(€8046/$8563) per patient with a supplemented VLPD (sVLPD) (difference, 
-₫15,925,449 [-€638/-$679]). From a patient's perspective, total cost of care in 
Vietnam was ₫217,872,043 (€8724/$9285) per patient with LPD versus ₫116,015,672 
(€4646/$4944) per patient with sVLPD (difference, -₫101,856,371 [-€4,079/ 
-$4341]). From a societal perspective, total cost of care in Vietnam was 
₫434,726,312 (€17,408/-$18,527) per patient with LPD versus ₫316,944,491 
(€12,692/ $13,508) per patient with sVLPD (difference, -₫117,781,820 [-€4716 
€/$5020).
IMPLICATIONS: Ketoanalogue-supplemented VLPD lowered costs compared with LPD in 
all 3 perspectives considered.

Due to increasing life expectancy and the associated demographic changes, more 
and more people are dependent on care. To identify a possible need for dental 
treatment, chewing function tests as assessment instruments have proven their 
effectiveness. In this article, the reader is given an overview of existing 
chewing function tests and their implementation. It is important that a patient 
with pain should be presented to a dentist immediately, regardless of whether 
a chewing function test is performed. Furthermore, chewing function tests are 
not a substitute for routine dental examinations, but they could provide 
information to (dental) laypersons as to whether an appointment should be 
arranged in a dental practice or whether a dental consultation is necessary.

Publisher: Durch die steigende Lebenserwartung und den damit verbundenen 
demografischen Wandel sind immer mehr Menschen auf Pflege angewiesen. Um erste 
Hinweise auf einen möglichen notwendigen zahnärztlichen Behandlungsbedarf zu 
geben, haben sich im zahnmedizinischen Bereich Kaufunktionstests als 
Assessmentinstrumente bewährt. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird dem Leser eine 
Übersicht über vorhandene Kaufunktionstests und deren Durchführung gegeben. An 
dieser Stelle ist darauf hinzuweisen, dass ein Patient mit Schmerzen unabhängig 
von einem Kaufunktionstest unverzüglich einer Zahnärztin/einem Zahnarzt 
vorgestellt werden sollte. Weiterhin ersetzen Kaufunktionstests keine 
zahnärztlichen Routineuntersuchungen, könnten jedoch auch (zahn-)medizinischen 
Laien Hinweise darauf geben, ob ein Termin in einer Zahnarztpraxis vereinbart 
werden sollte oder ein zahnärztliches Konsil notwendig ist.

BACKGROUND: Women with inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have 
increased lifetime risks for developing breast and/or ovarian cancer and may 
develop these cancers around the age of 30 years. Therefore, prevention of 
breast and ovarian cancer in these women may need to start relatively early in 
life. In this study we systematically evaluate the long-term effectiveness and 
cost effectiveness of different prevention strategies for breast and ovarian 
cancer in women with BRCA-1/2 mutation in Germany.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model simulating lifetime breast and ovarian 
cancer development in BRCA-1/2 carriers was developed. Different strategies 
including intensified surveillance (IS), prophylactic bilateral mastectomy 
(PBM), and prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (PBSO) alone or in 
combination at different ages were evaluated. German clinical, epidemiological, 
and economic (in 2022 Euro) data were used. Outcomes included cancer incidences, 
mortality, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and discounted 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). We adopted the German health-care 
system perspective and discounted costs and health effects with 3% annually.
RESULTS: All intervention strategies are more effective and less costly than IS 
alone. Prevention with PBM plus PBSO at age 30 maximizes life expectancy with 
6.3 LYs gained, whereas PBM at age 30 with delayed PBSO at age 35 improves 
quality of life with 11.1 QALYs gained, when compared to IS alone. A further 
delay of PBSO was associated with lower effectiveness. Both strategies are cost 
effective with ICERs significantly below 10,000 EUR/LYG or QALY.
CONCLUSION: Based on our results, PBM at age 30 plus PBSO between age 30 and 40 
prolongs life and is cost effective in women with BRCA-1/2 mutations in Germany. 
Serial preventive surgeries with delayed PBSO potentially improve quality of 
life for women. However, delaying PBM and/or PBSO further may lead to increased 
mortality and reduced QALYs.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the temporal trends in the burden of overall and 
type-specific cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in youths and young adults and its 
attributable risk factors is important for effective and targeted prevention 
strategies and measures. We aimed to provide a standardized and comprehensive 
estimation of the prevalence, incidence, disability-adjusted life years (DALY), 
and mortality rate of CVDs and its associated risk factors in youths and young 
adults aged 15-39 years at global, regional, and national levels.
METHODS: We applied Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2019 analytical tools to calculate the age-standardized incidence, 
prevalence, DALY, and mortality rate of overall and type-specific CVDs (i.e., 
rheumatic heart disease, ischemic heart disease, stroke, hypertensive heart 
disease, non-rheumatic valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, 
atrial fibrillation and flutter, aortic aneurysm, and endocarditis) among youths 
and young adults aged 15-39 years by age, sex, region, sociodemographic index 
and across 204 countries/territories from 1990 to 2019, and proportional DALY of 
CVDs attributable to associated risk factors.
RESULTS: The global age-standardized DALY (per 100,000 population) for CVDs in 
youths and young adults significantly decreased from 1257.51 (95% confidence 
interval 1257.03, 1257.99) in 1990 to 990.64 (990.28, 990.99) in 2019 with an 
average annual percent change (AAPC) of - 0.81% (- 1.04%, - 0.58%, P < 0.001), 
and the age-standardized mortality rate also significantly decreased from 19.83 
(19.77, 19.89) to 15.12 (15.08, 15.16) with an AAPC of - 0.93% 
(- 1.21%, - 0.66%, P < 0.001). However, the global age-standardized incidence 
rate (per 100,000 population) moderately increased from 126.80 (126.65, 126.95) 
in 1990 to 129.85 (129.72, 129.98) in 2019 with an AAPC of 0.08% (0.00%, 0.16%, 
P = 0.040), and the age-standardized prevalence rate significantly increased 
from 1477.54 (1477.03, 1478.06) to 1645.32 (1644.86, 1645.78) with an AAPC of 
0.38% (0.35%, 0.40%, P < 0.001). In terms of type-specific CVDs, the 
age-standardized incidence and prevalence rate in rheumatic heart disease, 
prevalence rate in ischemic heart disease, and incidence rate in endocarditis 
increased from 1990 to 2019 (all P < 0.001). When stratified by sociodemographic 
index (SDI), the countries/territories with low and low-middle SDI had a higher 
burden of CVDs than the countries/territories with high and high-middle SDI. 
Women had a higher prevalence rate of CVDs than men, whereas men had a higher 
DALY and mortality rate than women. High systolic blood pressure, high body mass 
index, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were the main attributable risk 
factors for DALY of CVDs for all included countries and territories. Household 
air pollution from solid fuels was an additional attributable risk factor for 
DALY of CVDs in low and low-middle SDI countries compared with middle, 
high-middle, and high SDI countries. Compared with women, DALY for CVDs in men 
was more likely to be affected by almost all risk factors, especially for 
smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial global burden of CVDs in youths and young 
adults in 2019. The burden of overall and type-specific CVDs varied by age, sex, 
SDI, region, and country. CVDs in young people are largely preventable, which 
deserve more attention in the targeted implementation of effective primary 
prevention strategies and expansion of young-people's responsive healthcare 
systems.

The majority of work-life research has been anchored around work-life 
conflict/facilitation and balance constructs, though these constructs have 
largely been examined in isolation from one another. The purpose of the current 
study is to provide a direct replication and longitudinal extension of Grawitch 
et al.'s cross-sectional study exploring work-life balance satisfaction's 
relation to interdomain conflict and facilitation. We conducted a three-wave 
longitudinal study (0, 1 and 6 months) to test the causal assumptions of the 
original study. In addition to exploring relationships between bidirectional 
conflict/facilitation and work-non-work balance (WLB) satisfaction variables, 
the pathways by which work-life constructs influence work and non-work life 
satisfaction were examined. Time 1 results largely replicated those from 
Grawitch et al. Time 2 and Time 3 models demonstrated consistency in the 
relationships between satisfaction with work and non-work life and work-life 
balance and general stability across time points. Work-life conflict and 
life-work facilitation demonstrated the strongest indirect effects from Time 1 
to Time 3 satisfaction constructs. Theoretical and practical implications are 
discussed in light of these findings.

Background Population growth, aging, and major alterations in epidemiologic 
trends inadvertently modulate the status of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) 
epidemiology. This investigation predicted RHD burden pattern and temporal 
trends to provide epidemiologic evidence. Methods and Results Prevalence, 
mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years data for RHD were obtained from 
the GBD (Global Burden of Disease) study. We performed decomposition analysis 
and frontier analysis to assess variations and burden in RHD from 1990 to 2019. 
In 2019, there were >40.50 million RHD cases worldwide, along with nearly 
0.31 million RHD-related deaths and 10.67 million years of healthy life lost to 
RHD. The RHD burden was commonly concentrated within lower sociodemographic 
index regions and countries. RHD primarily affects women (22.52 million cases in 
2019), and the largest age-specific prevalence rate was at 25 to 29 years in 
women and 20 to 24 years in men. Multiple reports demonstrated prominent 
downregulation of RHD-related mortality and disability-adjusted life-years at 
the global, regional, and national levels. Decomposition analysis revealed that 
the observed improvements in RHD burden were primarily due to epidemiological 
alteration; however, it was negatively affected by population growth and aging. 
Frontier analysis revealed that the age-standardized prevalence rates were 
negatively linked to sociodemographic index, whereas Somalia and Burkina Faso, 
with lower sociodemographic index, showed the lowest overall difference from the 
frontier boundaries of mortality and disability-adjusted life-years. Conclusions 
RHD remains a major global public health issue. Countries such as Somalia and 
Burkina Faso are particularly successful in managing adverse outcomes from RHD 
and may serve as a template for other countries.

AIMS: To support decision-making in children undergoing aortic valve replacement 
(AVR), by providing a comprehensive overview of published outcomes after 
paediatric AVR, and microsimulation-based age-specific estimates of outcome with 
different valve substitutes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic review of published literature reporting 
clinical outcome after paediatric AVR (mean age <18 years) published between 
1/1/1990 and 11/08/2021 was conducted. Publications reporting outcome after 
paediatric Ross procedure, mechanical AVR (mAVR), homograft AVR (hAVR), and/or 
bioprosthetic AVR were considered for inclusion. Early risks (<30d), late event 
rates (>30d) and time-to-event data were pooled and entered into a 
microsimulation model. Sixty-eight studies, of which one prospective and 67 
retrospective cohort studies, were included, encompassing a total of 5259 
patients (37 435 patient-years; median follow-up: 5.9 years; range 1-21 years). 
Pooled mean age for the Ross procedure, mAVR, and hAVR was 9.2 ± 5.6, 13.0 ± 
3.4, and 8.4 ± 5.4 years, respectively. Pooled early mortality for the Ross 
procedure, mAVR, and hAVR was 3.7% (95% CI, 3.0%-4.7%), 7.0% (5.1%-9.6%), and 
10.6% (6.6%-17.0%), respectively, and late mortality rate was 0.5%/year 
(0.4%-0.7%/year), 1.0%/year (0.6%-1.5%/year), and 1.4%/year (0.8%-2.5%/year), 
respectively. Microsimulation-based mean life-expectancy in the first 20 years 
was 18.9 years (18.6-19.1 years) after Ross (relative life-expectancy: 94.8%) 
and 17.0 years (16.5-17.6 years) after mAVR (relative life-expectancy: 86.3%). 
Microsimulation-based 20-year risk of aortic valve reintervention was 42.0% (95% 
CI: 39.6%-44.6%) after Ross and 17.8% (95% CI: 17.0%-19.4%) after mAVR.
CONCLUSION: Results of paediatric AVR are currently suboptimal with substantial 
mortality especially in the very young with considerable reintervention hazards 
for all valve substitutes, but the Ross procedure provides a survival benefit 
over mAVR. Pros and cons of substitutes should be carefully weighed during 
paediatric valve selection.

Much less is known about the sex gap in lifespan variation, which reflects 
inequalities in the length of life, than about the sex gap in life expectancy 
(average length of life). We examined the contributions of age groups and causes 
of death to the sex gap in lifespan variation for 28 European countries, grouped 
into five European regions. In 2010-15, males in Europe displayed a 
6.8-year-lower life expectancy and a 2.3-year-higher standard deviation in 
lifespan than females, with clear regional differences. Sex differences in 
lifespan variation are attributable largely to higher external mortality among 
males aged 30-39, whereas sex differences in life expectancy are due 
predominantly to higher smoking-related and cardiovascular disease mortality 
among males aged 60-69. The distinct findings for the sex gap in lifespan 
variation and the sex gap in life expectancy provide additional insights into 
the survival differences between the sexes.

mAbs have been instrumental for targeted cancer therapies. However, their 
relatively large size and physicochemical properties result in a heterogenous 
distribution in the tumor microenvironment, usually restricted to the first cell 
layers surrounding blood vessels, and a limited ability to penetrate the brain. 
Nanobodies are tenfold smaller, resulting in a deeper tumor penetration and the 
ability to reach cells in poorly perfused tumor areas. Nanobodies are rapidly 
cleared from the circulation, which generates a fast target-to-background 
contrast that is ideally suited for molecular imaging purposes but may be less 
optimal for therapy. To circumvent this problem, nanobodies have been formatted 
to noncovalently bind albumin, increasing their serum half-life without majorly 
increasing their size. Finally, nanobodies have shown superior qualities to 
infiltrate brain tumors as compared to mAbs. In this review, we discuss why 
these features make nanobodies prime candidates for targeted therapy of cancer.

BACKGROUND: Researchers are increasingly interested in better methods for 
assessing the pace of aging in older adults, including vocal analysis. The 
present study sought to determine whether paralinguistic vocal attributes 
improve estimates of the age and risk of mortality in older adults.
METHODS: To measure vocal age, we curated interviews provided by male US World 
War II Veterans in the Library of Congress collection. We used diarization to 
identify speakers and measure vocal features and matched recording data to 
mortality information. Veterans (N=2,447) were randomly split into testing 
(n=1,467) and validation (n=980) subsets to generate estimations of vocal age 
and years of life remaining. Results were replicated to examine out-of-sample 
utility using Korean War Veterans (N=352).
RESULTS: WWII Veterans' average age was 86.08 at the time of recording and 91.28 
at the time of death. Overall, 7.4% were prisoners of war, 43.3% were Army 
Veterans, and 29.3% were drafted. Vocal-age estimates (mean absolute 
error=3.255) were within five years of chronological age, 78.5% of the time. 
With chronological age held constant, older vocal-age estimation was correlated 
with shorter life expectancy (aHR = 1.10, 95% C.I.=[1.06-1.15], P<0.001), even 
when adjusting for age at vocal assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: Computational analyses reduced estimation error by 71.94% 
(approximately eight years) and produced vocal age estimates that were 
correlated with both age and predicted time until death when age was held 
constant. Paralinguistic analyses augment other assessments for individuals when 
oral patient histories are recorded.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a particularly aggressive and high-grade brain 
cancer, with poor prognosis and life expectancy, in urgent need of novel 
therapies. These severe outcomes are compounded by the difficulty in 
distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues using conventional 
imaging techniques. Metallic nanoparticles (NPs) are advantageous due to their 
diverse optical and physical properties, such as their targeting and imaging 
potential. In this work, the uptake, distribution, and location of silica coated 
gold nanoparticles (AuNP-SHINs) within multicellular tumour spheroids (MTS) 
derived from U87-MG glioblastoma cells was investigated by surface enhanced 
Raman scattering (SERS) optical mapping. MTS are three-dimensional in vitro 
tumour mimics that represent a tumour in vivo much more closely than that of a 
two-dimensional cell culture. By using AuNP-SHIN nanotags, it is possible to 
readily functionalise the inner gold surface with a Raman reporter, and the 
outer silica surface with an antibody for tumour specific targeting. The 
nanotags were designed to target the biomarker tenascin-C overexpressed in 
U87-MG glioblastoma cells. Immunochemistry indicated that tenascin-C was 
upregulated within the core of the MTS, however limitations such as NP size, 
quiescence, and hypoxia, restricted the penetration of the nanotags to the core 
and they remained in the outer proliferating cells of the spheroids. Previous 
examples of MTS studies using SERS demonstrated the incubation of NPs on a 2D 
monolayer of cells, with the subsequent formation of the MTS from these 
pre-incubated cells. Here, we focus on the localisation of the NPs after 
incubation into pre-formed MTS to establish a better understanding of targeting 
and NP uptake. Therefore, this work highlights the importance for the 
investigation and translation of NP uptake into these 3D in vitro models.

The approval of CDK4/6 inhibitors has dramatically improved care for the 
treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, but navigating the 
rapidly-expanding treatment evidence base is challenging. In this narrative 
review, we provide best-practice recommendations for the first-line treatment of 
HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer in Canada based on relevant literature, 
clinical guidelines, and our own clinical experience. Due to statistically 
significant improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival, 
ribociclib + aromatase inhibitor is our preferred first-line treatment for de 
novo advanced disease or relapse ≥12 months after completion of adjuvant 
endocrine therapy and ribociclib or abemaciclib + fulvestrant is our preferred 
first-line treatment for patients experiencing early relapse. Abemaciclib or 
palbociclib may be used when alternatives to ribociclib are needed, and 
endocrine therapy can be used alone in the case of contraindication to CDK4/6 
inhibitors or limited life expectancy. Considerations for special 
populations-including frail and fit elderly patients, as well as those with 
visceral disease, brain metastases, and oligometastatic disease-are also 
explored. For monitoring, we recommend an approach across CDK4/6 inhibitors. For 
mutational testing, we recommend routinely performing ER/PR/HER2 testing to 
confirm the subtype of advanced disease at the time of progression and to 
consider ESR1 and PIK3CA testing for select patients. Where possible, engage a 
multidisciplinary care team to apply evidence in a patient-centric manner.

The United States population is living longer and healthier than ever. This 
enables our communities-and our society-to continue to benefit from our 
knowledge, experience, and energy as we age. The public health system is 
foundational for increasing life expectancy, and now it has the opportunity to 
further support older adult health and well-being. Trust for America's Health 
(TFAH), in partnership with The John A. Hartford Foundation, launched the 
age-friendly public health systems initiative in 2017 with the goal of raising 
awareness within the public health sector of its many potential roles in healthy 
aging. TFAH has worked with state and local departments of health to build 
capacity and expertise in older adult health and has provided guidance and 
technical assistance to expand this work across the U.S. TFAH now envisions a 
public health system that has healthy aging as a core function. This paper aims 
to describe why the public health sector should adopt healthy aging policies and 
practices, how this is being operationalized at the state and local levels, and 
the value of age-friendly public health systems within the age-friendly 
ecosystem.

The ham mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae and the red-legged ham beetle Necrobia 
rufipes are harmful pests to several high-valued stored products. The regulatory 
phase-out of the fumigant methyl bromide necessitates the search for alternative 
fumigants. Propylene oxide (PPO) and ethyl formate (EF) were therefore evaluated 
in the laboratory for controlling these pests of dry-cured hams. 
Concentration-mortality studies at 25 °C of PPO and EF found that the mobile 
stages of the mites were very susceptible to low concentrations of 10 mg/L and 
less of each gas, while mite eggs were very tolerant and required 20 mg/L for 
PPO and 80 mg/L of EF for 100% mortality. Mixed life stage cultures of mites and 
beetles were treated for 24 h with either PPO or EF at 1× and 2× the estimated 
99% lethal doses and confirmed effectiveness for controlling simulated pest 
populations. The sorptive properties of each gas in chambers with ham pieces, 
dog food kibbles, or fish meal were minimal for a reduction in mite toxicity 
when compared to treatments in empty chambers. There was no evidence that any 
desorbed gas occurred at a level toxic to mite eggs in any of the fumigated 
commodities. These fumigation studies with ham pests support further work with 
PPO and EF on any changes in the sensory quality of dry-cured hams for human 
taste and for commercial-scale fumigations toward regulatory approval.

BACKGROUND: Some authors have estimated that the incidence of testicular germ 
cell tumors in individuals with trisomy 21 is more than fivefold higher than 
that in the general population.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to estimate the incidence of urological 
tumors in patients with Down's syndrome.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a search strategy in MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, LILACS, 
and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception 
to nowadays. We assessed the risk of bias and performed a meta-analysis. Also, 
the heterogeneity between trials was evaluated by the I2 test. We completed the 
subgroup analysis based on the type of urological tumor (testis, bladder, 
kidney, upper urological tract, penile, retroperitoneum).
RESULTS: We found 350 studies by the search strategy. After carefully reviewing, 
full-text studies were included. 16,248 individuals with Down's syndrome were 
included, and 42 patients presented with urological tumors. There was a total 
incidence of 0.1%, 95%CI (0.06-0.19), I2 61%. The most common urological tumor 
reported was testicular. We found six studies describing 31 events and an 
overall incidence of 0.19%, 95%CI (0.11-0.33), I2: 51%. Other studies reported 
kidney, penile, upper urinary tract, bladder, and retroperitoneum tumors with a 
very low incidence, 0.02%, 0.06%, 0.03%, 0.11%and 0.07%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Regarding non-testicular urological tumors, we found incidences as 
low as 0.02% in kidney cancer or 0.03% in the upper-urothelial tract tumors. It 
is also lower than the general population. Compared to the age of onset of 
patients, it is also lower than the general population, perhaps related to a 
shorter life expectancy. As a limitation, we found a high heterogeneity and a 
lack of information regarding non-testicular tumors.
CONCLUSION: There was a very low incidence of urological tumors in people with 
Down's syndrome. Testis tumor was the most frequently described in all cohorts 
and within a normal distribution range.

Algal cell proliferation has posed significant problems for traditional water 
treatment facilities; these problems are attributed to surface hydrophilicity 
and electrostatic repulsion. Biological aerated filters (BAFs) have been 
extensively used in wastewater treatment to remove pollutants such as algal 
cells by utilizing the adsorption and separation capabilities of the filter 
media. In this study, a BAF was supplemented with biological filter medium 
(Marchantia polymorpha) to assess its effectiveness of pretreating aquaculture 
wastewater. In terms of process performance, steady and consistent treatment was 
achieved by the BAF with M. polymorpha (BAF2) under an algal cell density as 
high as 1.65 × 108 cell/L, with average removal rates for NH4+-N and algae cells 
of 74.4% and 81.9%, respectively. The photosynthetic activity parameters 
(rETRmax, α, Fv/Fm, and Ik) of the influent and effluent were quantitatively 
assessed, and M. polymorpha was found to remove algae by disrupting the 
photosynthetic system of the algal cells. Furthermore, the addition of the M. 
polymorpha filter medium enhanced the community structure of the functional 
microbes in the BAF system. The highest microbial community richness and 
diversity were observed in the BAF2. Meanwhile, M. polymorpha promoted an 
increase in the abundance of denitrifying bacteria, including Bdellovibrio and 
Pseudomonas. Overall, this work offers a unique perspective on the aquaculture 
wastewater pretreatment process and BAF design.

Cardiovascular disease in type 1 diabetes, an underestimated danger: 
Epidemiological and pathophysiological data.

Cardiovascular disease (CV) is a common complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D) 
and a leading cause of death. T1D patients are more likely to develop CV disease 
(CVD) early in life and show a reduction of life expectancy of at least 11 
years. Patients with a young age of T1D onset have a substantially higher CV 
risk. The reasons for increased atherosclerosis in T1D patients are not entirely 
explained. In addition to the typical CV risk factors, long-term hyperglycemia 
has a significant impact by inducing oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, 
monocyte adhesion, arterial wall thickening and endothelial dysfunction. 
Additionally, CVD in T1D is also associated with nephropathy. However, CVD risk 
is still significantly increased in T1D patients, in good glycemic control 
without additional CV risk factors, indicating the involvement of supplementary 
potential factors. By increasing oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, and 
endothelial dysfunction, hypoglycemia and glucose variability may exacerbate 
CVD. Moreover, significant qualitative and functional abnormalities of 
lipoproteins are present in even well-controlled T1D patients and are likely to 
play a role in the development of atherosclerosis and the promotion of CVD. 
According to recent research, immune system dysfunction, which is typical of 
auto-immune T1D, may also promote CVD, likely via inflammatory pathways. In 
addition, T1D patients who are overweight or obese exhibit an additional CV risk 
due to pathophysiological mechanisms that are similar to those seen in T2D.

No evidence for the effect of entrainment's phase on duration reproduction and 
precision of regular intervals.

Perception of time is not always veridical; rather, it is subjected to 
distortions. One such compelling distortion is that the duration of regularly 
spaced intervals is often overestimated. One account suggests that excitatory 
phases of neural entrainment concomitant with such stimuli play a major role. 
However, assessing the correlation between the power of entrained oscillations 
and time dilation has yielded inconclusive results. In this study, we evaluated 
whether phase characteristics of neural oscillations impact time dilation. For 
this purpose, we entrained 10-Hz oscillations and experimentally manipulated the 
presentation of flickers so that they were presented either in-phase or 
out-of-phase relative to the established rhythm. Simultaneous 
electroencephalography (EEG) recordings confirmed that in-phase and out-of-phase 
flickers had landed on different inhibitory phases of high-amplitude alpha 
oscillations. Moreover, to control for confounding factors of expectancy and 
masking, we created two additional conditions. Results, supplemented by the 
Bayesian analysis, indicated that the phase of entrained visual alpha 
oscillation does not differentially affect flicker-induced time dilation. 
Repeating the same experiment with regularly spaced auditory stimuli replicated 
the null findings. Moreover, we found a robust enhancement of precision for the 
reproduction of flickers relative to static stimuli that were partially 
supported by entrainment models. We discussed our results within the framework 
of neural oscillations and time-perception models, suggesting that inhibitory 
cycles of visual alpha may have little relevance to the overestimation of 
regularly spaced intervals. Moreover, based on our findings, we proposed that 
temporal oscillators, assumed in entrainment models, may act independently of 
excitatory phases in the brain's lower level sensory areas.

BACKGROUND: Few guidelines address fracture prevention medication use in nursing 
home (NH) residents with dementia.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify factors that influence prescriber 
decision-making for deprescribing of bisphosphonates for older NH residents with 
dementia.
METHODS: We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with prescribers who care 
for older adults with dementia in NHs.
MAIN MEASURES: Interview prompts addressed experiences treating fractures, 
benefits, and harms of bisphosphonates, and experiences with deprescribing. 
Coding was guided by the social-ecological framework including patient-level 
(intrapersonal) and external (interpersonal, system, community, and policy) 
influences.
RESULTS: Most prescribers were physicians (83%); 75% were female and 75% were 
White. Most (75%) spent less than half of their clinical effort in NHs and half 
were in the first decade of practice. Among patient-level influences, 
prescribers uniformly agreed that a prior bisphosphonate treatment course of 
several years, emergence of adverse effects, and changing goals of care or 
limited life expectancy were compelling reasons to deprescribe. External 
influences were frequently discussed as barriers to deprescribing. At the 
interpersonal level, prescribers noted that family/informal caregivers are 
diverse in their involvement in decision-making, and frequently concerned about 
the adverse effects of bisphosphonates, but perceive deprescribing as 
"withdrawing care." At the health system level, prescribers felt that frequent 
transitions make it difficult to determine duration of prior treatment and to 
implement deprescribing. At the policy level, prescribers highlighted the lack 
of guidelines addressing residents with limited mobility and dementia or 
criteria for deprescribing, including uncertainty in the setting of prior 
fractures and lack of bone densitometry in NHs.
CONCLUSION: Systems-level barriers to evaluating bone densitometry and treatment 
history in NHs may impede person-centered decision-making for fracture 
prevention. Further research is needed to evaluate the residual benefits of 
bisphosphonates in medically complex residents with limited mobility and 
dementia to inform recommendations for deprescribing versus continued use.
