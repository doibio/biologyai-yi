to healthy aging, this study examined changes in physical, nutritional, 
psychological and social functions in older adults who participated in annual 
health checkups over the period.
METHODS: Data sources were participants in annual health checkups conducted from 
2002 to 2012 and respondents to biannual monitoring surveys conducted from 2003 
to 2011. The target population was all older adults aged 70 years and over 
living in Kusatsu. The average participation rate over the period was 34.7% for 
the annual health checkups and 95.0% for the monitoring surveys. First, we 
examined the representativeness of the participants in annual health checkups by 
comparing them with the responders to monitoring surveys in terms of their 
higher-level functional capacity, as measured by the Tokyo Metropolitan 
Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence (TMIG-IC) (Analysis 1). Second, we 
examined changes in the physical (4 measures), nutritional (3 measures), and 
psychological and social (4 measures) functions of participants in annual health 
checkups over the period. In this analysis, we standardized the data for each 
year on 11 measures to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.0 using the 
2002 data as the standard, and conducted statistical tests for the slopes of the 
linear approximate equation (intercept=0) (Analysis 2).
RESULTS: In Analysis 1, the TMIG-IC scores for participants in the annual health 
checkups were significantly higher in both sexes than were those for responders 
to the monitoring surveys. However, there were no significant year×group 
interactions in the scores. The difference in scores between the two groups was 
small for participants in their seventies, but large for participants in their 
eighties or over. Analysis 2 showed that all physical functions improved 
significantly over the period in both sexes, and the slopes of the linear 
approximate equation were steeper for maximal and usual gait speeds (slope=0.050 
and 0.048, respectively, in men; 0.067 and 0.060, respectively, in women) than 
for other measures. In women, in addition to physical function, scores on the 
Mini-Mental State Examination (slope=0.053), Geriatric Depression Scale 
(slope=0.027), and Social Roll Scale (slope=0.019) also increased significantly.
CONCLUSION: Although participants in annual health checkups were biased toward 
better functioning, the degree of the bias did not change significantly over the 
period. During the same period, physical function for both sexes, and 
psychological and social functions for women, improved significantly. It may be 
concluded that functional improvement in older adults contributed to the healthy 
longevity in Kusatsu.

In clinical practice, the combination of congenital heart disease (CHD) with 
malformations of other organs occurs in about 10 % of cases, including 
chromosomal disease with heart defects, which are observed mainly with certain 
syndromes. In the Bakoulev SCCS (Moscow, Russian Federation), from 01.2005 to 
01.2011, complete atrioventricular septal defect (CAVSD) repair was performed on 
163 patients (5.6 ± 3.0 months) with Down Syndrome (DS) using the single-patch 
(n = 40) and the two-patch (n = 123) methods. The control group consisted of 214 
infants aged 6.49 ± 3.03 months with CAVSD and normal karyotype. A retrospective 
cohort study was made, as well as a comparative analysis of the immediate (up to 
30 days) and long-term (12-75 months, at the average of 56 ± 15) results of the 
repair of CAVSD in infants with DSand normal karyotype/chromosome set (NK). 
During the hospital treatment period, we registered the following complications: 
pulmonary hypertensive crises in 6 % (n = 9) of patients with DS and in 10 % (n 
= 21) of infants with NK, infectious complications in 21% (n = 34) of patients 
with DS and in 8% (n = 17) of infants with NK. Squeal structures in groups were 
differentiated. The doses and duration of cardiotonic support in the NK patients 
were significantly higher in comparison with the DS patients (7.5 ± 2.1 days vs 
3.4 ± 1.15 days, p < 0.05). Respiratory infections on the background of 
immunodeficiency were found more often in the DS group (21% in DS vs 8% in NK, p 
< 0.05), demanding higher postoperative pulmonary ventilation time in DS 
patients in comparison with normal infants was required (DS 5.1 ± 2.8 days vs NK 
1.7 ± 0.8 days, p < 0.05). In DS infants, abnormalities of the left AV valve 
(doubling of the mitral valve, single papillary muscle, closely spaced groups of 
papillary muscles, leaflet or chordal dysplasia, hypoplastic valve ring) occur 
as statistically significant (8% DS vs 12% NK; p < 0.05) which is rarer than in 
children having the same defect, but without Down syndrome. Concerning the 
long-term results, there was no significant difference (Gehan-Wilcoxon test) in 
actuarial freedom from reoperation after repair of CAVSD between DS and NK 
groups (p < 0.13). However, the presence of Down Syndrome in patients 
significantly increases the risk of severe co-morbidities that have a 
significant impact on the recovery period, as well as on life expectancy even 
after successful CHD correction.

The dynamics of architectural complexity on coral reefs under climate change.

One striking feature of coral reef ecosystems is the complex benthic 
architecture which supports diverse and abundant fauna, particularly of reef 
fish. Reef-building corals are in decline worldwide, with a corresponding loss 
of live coral cover resulting in a loss of architectural complexity. 
Understanding the dynamics of the reef architecture is therefore important to 
envision the ability of corals to maintain functional habitats in an era of 
climate change. Here, we develop a mechanistic model of reef topographical 
complexity for contemporary Caribbean reefs. The model describes the dynamics of 
corals and other benthic taxa under climate-driven disturbances (hurricanes and 
coral bleaching). Corals have a simplified shape with explicit diameter and 
height, allowing species-specific calculation of their colony surface and 
volume. Growth and the mechanical (hurricanes) and biological erosion 
(parrotfish) of carbonate skeletons are important in driving the pace of 
extension/reduction in the upper reef surface, the net outcome being quantified 
by a simple surface roughness index (reef rugosity). The model accurately 
simulated the decadal changes of coral cover observed in Cozumel (Mexico) 
between 1984 and 2008, and provided a realistic hindcast of coral colony-scale 
(1-10 m) changing rugosity over the same period. We then projected future 
changes of Caribbean reef rugosity in response to global warming. Under severe 
and frequent thermal stress, the model predicted a dramatic loss of rugosity 
over the next two or three decades. Critically, reefs with managed parrotfish 
populations were able to delay the general loss of architectural complexity, as 
the benefits of grazing in maintaining living coral outweighed the bioerosion of 
dead coral skeletons. Overall, this model provides the first explicit 
projections of reef rugosity in a warming climate, and highlights the need of 
combining local (protecting and restoring high grazing) to global (mitigation of 
greenhouse gas emissions) interventions for the persistence of functional reef 
habitats.

Overweight and obesity have become a global health problem. Obesity and 
excessive weight gain during pregnancy have a serious impact on maternal, fetal 
and neonatal outcomes. Pre-conceptional obesity and excessive weight gain during 
pregnancy are associated with weight gain in women following childbirth leading 
to associated risks such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes. Long-term risks for the offspring are an increased risk for early 
cardiovascular events, metabolic syndrome and decreased life expectancy as 
adults. German health care has not yet adequately responded to this development. 
There are no clinical guidelines for obesity before, during or after pregnancy, 
there are no concerted actions amongst midwives, obstetricians, health advisors, 
politicians and the media. Research projects on effective interventions are 
lacking although health care concepts would be urgently needed to reduce future 
metabolic and cardiovascular risks for women and children as well as to minimize 
the associated costs for the society.

Publisher: Adipositas ist inzwischen ein globales gesundheitliches Problem. 
Adipositas und starke Gewichtszunahme in der Schwangerschaft haben in 
Industrieländern zu einer Zunahme von Komplikationen während der Gravidität 
geführt, die mütterliches und kindliches Outcome beeinträchtigen. Nicht nur die 
präkonzeptionelle Adipositas, sondern auch die übermäßige Gewichtszunahme 
während der Gravidität sind verantwortlich für eine Gewichtszunahme von Frauen 
nach der Geburt sowie den assoziierten Risiken wie metabolisches Syndrom, 
kardiovaskuläre Erkrankungen und Diabetes, aber auch für Langzeitrisiken der 
Kinder wie Adipositas, höhere Morbidität und frühere Sterblichkeit als 
Erwachsene. In Deutschland hat man bisher nicht adäquat auf diese Entwicklung 
reagiert – es gibt weder klinische Richtlinien für die Schwangerschaft, noch 
konzertierte Aktionen von Hebammen, Geburtsmedizinern, Gesundheitsberatern, 
Politik und Medien. Untersuchungsprojekte über effektive Interventionen fehlen. 
Dies alles wäre jedoch erforderlich, um die gesundheitlichen Risiken für Frauen 
und Kinder sowie die damit verbundenen Kosten für das Gesundheitssystem und 
letztlich für unsere Gesellschaft einzuschränken.

As issues of environment and energy draw keen interest around the globe due to 
such problems as global warming and the energy crisis, LED with high optical 
efficiency is brought to the fore as the next generation lighting. In addition, 
as the national income level gets higher and life expectancy is extended, 
interest in the enhancement of life quality is increasing. Accordingly, the 
trend of lightings is changing from mere adjustment of light intensity to system 
lighting in order to enhance the quality of one's life as well as reduce energy 
consumption. Thus, this study aims to design LED context lighting system that 
automatically recognizes the location and acts of a user in residential areas 
and creates an appropriate lighting environment. The proposed system designed in 
this study includes three types of processing: first, the creation of a lighting 
environment index suitable for the user's surroundings and lighting control 
scenarios and second, it measures and analyzes the optical characteristics that 
change depending on the dimming control of lighting and applies them to the 
index. Lastly, it adopts PIR, piezoelectric, and power sensor to grasp the 
location and acts of the user and create a lighting environment suitable for the 
current context.

Purpose : To assess the comparative effectiveness of thoracic endovascular 
aortic repair (TEVAR) vs. open surgical repair (OSR) of complicated acute type B 
aortic dissections (cABAD) using decision analysis. Methods : A decision 
analysis comparing TEVAR and OSR for cABAD included variables extracted from the 
best-available evidence. Main outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
presented with the 95% credibility intervals (CI), and number of reinterventions 
over the remaining lifetime. Different clinical scenarios, including age, 
gender, and risk profile were analyzed. Parameter uncertainty was analyzed using 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results : In the reference case, a cohort of 
55-year-old men, TEVAR was preferred over OSR: 7.07 QALYs (95% CI 6.77 to 7.38) 
vs. 6.34 QALYs (95% CI 6.04 to 6.66) for OSR. The difference of 0.73 QALYs (95% 
CI 0.29 to 1.17) is equal to 8.5 months in perfect health. TEVAR was more 
effective in all analyzed cases and age groups. Perioperative mortality was the 
most important variable affecting the difference between OSR and TEVAR, followed 
by the relative risk and percentage of aortic-related complications. Total 
expected reinterventions were 0.43/patient (TEVAR) and 0.35/patient (OSR). 
Conclusion : The results of this decision model for the treatment of cABAD 
suggest that TEVAR is preferred over OSR. Although a higher number of 
reinterventions is expected, the total effectiveness of TEVAR is higher for all 
age groups. OSR should be reserved for patients whose aortic anatomy is 
unsuitable for endovascular repair.

[Treatment-resistant schizophrenia].

[Article in French]

Yahyaten OB.

Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that causes severe cognitive, behavioral 
and social dysfunction, responsible for a shortening of the life expectancy of 
patients, with an increased risk of suicide, cardiovascular disease and cancer. 
The management of patient with schizophrenia is global and atypical 
antipsychotics, antagonizing dopamine pathway, are the first line 
pharmacological treatment. Clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic 
discovered, is currently still the most effective molecule against 
schizophrenia, while causing less extrapyramidal side effects. Its particular 
pharmacological behavior towards serotonergic, muscarinic and NMDA receptors, 
seems essential to its action. However, clozapine is responsible for 
immunological and metabolic lethal adverse events, preventing its wider use. 
Clozapine is therefore reserved for resistant schizophrenia cases. Monitoring 
patients with different scales such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and 
the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale showed that there were forms of 
ultra-resistant schizophrenia. The treatment in this case, must be customized to 
the patient's symptomatology, but the combination of clozapine with other 
pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments, shows yet only small 
improvements.

OBJECTIVES: Low protein diets (LPDs) are milestones in chronic kidney disease 
(CKD). Concerns over compliance and safety limit their use. The aim of this 
study was to test the feasibility and main results of a multiple-choice approach 
to LPDs, adapted to patient preferences.
METHODS: From December 2007 to January 2013, all CKD patients (stages 4/5; 
progressive stage 3) without contraindications (malnutrition, short life 
expectancy), were offered two main LPDs (proteins 0.6 g/kg daily): Vegan 
supplemented (LPD-KA) or with "aproteic" commercial food (LPD-ACF). LPDs 
followed a qualitative approach based on forbidden and allowed food; one to 
three free meals per week, and flexible control policy (1-3 mo). Start of 
dialysis, death, and combined outcome (death-dialysis) were analyzed by 
Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox model. Comparison with dialysis in patients with 
glomerular filtration rate (GRF) <15 mL/min, (corresponding to "early" dialysis 
start) employed standardized mortality rates, with respect to the Italian and 
the United States Dialysis Registry.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five patients (222 patient-years) started at least a 
trial of LPD-KA, 122 (177 patients-years) LPD-ACF; only 3 patients with GFR <30 
mL/min denied an LPD trial. Patients who chose LPD-KA were younger than those on 
LPD-ACF (63 versus 74 y), had less comorbidity (82% versus 93%), higher 
proteinuria (1.4 versus 0.7 g/d) and lower GFR (17 versus 23 mL/min) (P < 
0.001). Median daily protein intake was 0.7 g/kg on both diets (Maroni-Mitch 
formula). The combined outcome (death or dialysis) was not influenced by the 
diet chosen (Cox analysis). Relative risk for death on the diet (patients with 
GFR <15 mL/min) was 0.5 with respect to the Italian Registry and 0.3 to the 
United States Dialysis Registry. The diets had comparable costs (1 y on 
dialysis: 50 patient-years on LPD).
CONCLUSIONS: The choice of diet is strictly linked to patient characteristics, 
thus supporting a multiple-choice offer. Once corrected for baseline data, both 
LPDs led to similar results, suggesting at least survival equivalence with 
dialysis, at lesser cost.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy in individuals with schizophrenia continues to 
increase. It is not clear whether cognitive deficits associated with 
schizophrenia remain as strong predictors of function in older and younger 
individuals. Thus, we assessed the relationship between cognition and functional 
competence in individuals with schizophrenia across 7 decades of life.
METHODS: We analyzed data obtained in 232 community-dwelling participants with 
schizophrenia (age range: 19-79 years). Cognition was assessed using the 
Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia 
Consensus Cognitive Battery. Functional competence was assessed using the UCSD 
Performance-based Skills Assessment, which includes measures of Comprehension 
and Planning of Recreational Activities Skills, Financial Skills, Communication 
Skills, Transportation Skills, and Household Management Skills. To assess the 
effects of Global Cognition on functional competence, we performed hierarchical 
multivariate linear or logistic regression analyses controlling for age, 
education, gender, and negative symptoms.
RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 49.1 (SD = 13.2, range = 19-79 years), 161 
(69%) were male, and 55 (24%) were aged ≥60. Global Cognition was a predictor of 
Comprehension and Planning Skills (Exp(β) = 1.048), Financial Skills (Exp(β) = 
1.104), Communication Skills (ΔR (2) = .31) and Transportation Skills (Exp(β) = 
1.066), but not Household Management Skills after adjusting for age, education, 
gender, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
CONCLUSION: Cognition remains a strong predictor of functional competence across 
the lifespan. These findings suggest that treating cognitive impairment 
associated with schizophrenia could improve individuals' function independent of 
their age.

PURPOSE: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors face an increased risk of 
treatment-related lung cancer. Screening with low-dose computed tomography 
(LDCT) may allow detection of early stage, resectable cancers. We developed a 
Markov decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model to estimate the merits of 
annual LDCT screening among HL survivors.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Population databases and HL-specific literature informed 
key model parameters, including lung cancer rates and stage distribution, 
cause-specific survival estimates, and utilities. Relative risks accounted for 
radiation therapy (RT) technique, smoking status (>10 pack-years or current 
smokers vs not), age at HL diagnosis, time from HL treatment, and excess 
radiation from LDCTs. LDCT assumptions, including expected stage-shift, 
false-positive rates, and likely additional workup were derived from the 
National Lung Screening Trial and preliminary results from an internal phase 2 
protocol that performed annual LDCTs in 53 HL survivors. We assumed a 3% 
discount rate and a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: Annual LDCT screening was cost effective for all smokers. A male smoker 
treated with mantle RT at age 25 achieved maximum QALYs by initiating screening 
12 years post-HL, with a life expectancy benefit of 2.1 months and an 
incremental cost of $34,841/QALY. Among nonsmokers, annual screening produced a 
QALY benefit in some cases, but the incremental cost was not below the WTP 
threshold for any patient subsets. As age at HL diagnosis increased, earlier 
initiation of screening improved outcomes. Sensitivity analyses revealed that 
the model was most sensitive to the lung cancer incidence and mortality rates 
and expected stage-shift from screening.
CONCLUSIONS: HL survivors are an important high-risk population that may benefit 
from screening, especially those treated in the past with large radiation fields 
including mantle or involved-field RT. Screening may be cost effective for all 
smokers but possibly not for nonsmokers despite a small life expectancy benefit.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Angiogenic blockade with irradiation may enhance the 
therapeutic ratio of radiation therapy (RT) through vascular normalization. We 
sought to determine the safety and toxicity profile of continuous daily-dosed 
sunitinib when combined with hypofractionated stereotactic RT (fSRT) for 
recurrent high-grade gliomas (rHGG).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients had malignant high-grade glioma that 
recurred or progressed after primary surgery and RT. All patients received a 
minimum of a 10-day course of fSRT, had World Health Organization performance 
status of 0 to 1, and a life expectancy of >3 months. During fSRT, sunitinib was 
administered at 37.5 mg daily. The primary endpoint was acute toxicity, and 
response was assessed via serial magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Eleven patients with rHGG were enrolled. The fSRT doses delivered 
ranged from 30 to 42 Gy in 2.5- to 3.75-Gy fractions. The median follow-up time 
was 40 months. Common acute toxicities included hematologic disorders, fatigue, 
hypertension, and elevated liver transaminases. Sunitinib and fSRT were well 
tolerated. One grade 4 mucositis toxicity occurred, and no grade 4 or 5 
hypertensive events or intracerebral hemorrhages occurred. One patient had a 
nearly complete response, and 4 patients had stable disease for >9 months. Two 
patients (18%) remain alive and progression-free >3 years from enrollment. The 
6-month progression-free survival was 45%.
CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib at a daily dose of 37.5 mg given concurrently with 
hypofractionated stereotactic reirradiation for rHGG yields acceptable 
toxicities and an encouraging 6-month progression-free survival.

INTRODUCTION: Proteomics is increasingly employed in both neurological and 
oncological research, and applied widely in every area of neuroscience research 
including brain cancer. Astrocytomas are the most common glioma and can occur in 
most parts of the brain and occasionally in the spinal cord. Patients with 
high-grade astrocytomas have a life expectancy of <1 year even after surgery, 
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted proteins from tumors and normal brain 
tissues and then evaluated the protein purity by Bradford test and 
spectrophotometry method. In this study, we separated proteins by the 
two-dimensional (2DG) gel electrophoresis method, and the spots were analyzed 
and compared using statistical data.
RESULTS: On each analytical 2D gel, an average of 800 spots was observed. In 
this study, 164 spots exhibited up-regulation of expression level, whereas the 
remaining 179 spots decreased in astrocytoma tumor relative to normal tissue. 
RESULTS demonstrate that functional clustering and principal component analysis 
(PCA) has considerable merits in aiding the interpretation of proteomic data. 
Proteomics is a powerful tool in identifying multiple proteins that are altered 
following a neuropharmacological intervention in a disease of the central 
nervous system (CNS).
CONCLUSION: 2-D gel and cluster analysis have important roles in the diagnostic 
management of astrocytoma patients, providing insight into tumor biology. The 
application of proteomics to CNS research has invariably been very successful in 
yielding large amounts of data.

BACKGROUND: Curative treatment for prostate cancer is associated with risks 
which may adversely influence quality of life. Furthermore, there is a 
considerable rate of overdiagnosis of tumors which would be non-life-threatening 
if left untreated. Efforts have been made to reduce overtreatment.
DISCUSSION: Beside the traditional conservative symptomatic management 
especially in elderly patients with meaningful comorbidity, several 
prostate-sparing or deferred treatment options are currently discussed. For all 
of them, insufficient data on efficacy and safety are available.
RESULTS: Because of the required long-term follow-up of large sample sizes, 
conclusive data will not become available in the near future. Therefore, these 
treatment options have to be considered experimental to a large degree. This 
applies both to focally ablative techniques and to active surveillance of 
prostate cancer in patients with a long further life expectancy. Only in 
carefully selected patients with favorable tumor-associated risk profiles and 
high risk of medium-term competing mortality may active surveillance be 
considered a valid and relatively safe treatment option.

As the importance of providing patient-centered palliative care for patients 
with advanced illnesses gains attention, standard dialysis delivery may be 
inconsistent with the goals of care for many patients with ESRD. Many dialysis 
patients with life expectancy of <1 year may desire a palliative approach to 
dialysis care, which focuses on aligning patient treatment with patients' 
informed preferences. This commentary elucidates what comprises a palliative 
approach to dialysis care and describes its potential and appropriate use. It 
also reviews the barriers to integrating such an approach into the current 
clinical paradigm of care and existing infrastructure and outlines system-level 
changes needed to accommodate such an approach.

BACKGROUND: The burden of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke varies between 
regions and over time. With differences in prognosis, prevalence of risk 
factors, and treatment strategies, knowledge of stroke pathological type is 
important for targeted region-specific health-care planning for stroke and could 
inform priorities for type-specific prevention strategies. We used data from the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to 
estimate the global and regional burden of first-ever ischaemic and haemorrhagic 
stroke during 1990-2010.
METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, LILACS, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, 
Global Health Database, the WHO library, and regional databases from 1990 to 
2012 to identify relevant studies published between 1990 and 2010. We applied 
the GBD 2010 analytical technique (DisMod-MR) to calculate regional and 
country-specific estimates for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke incidence, 
mortality, mortality-to-incidence ratio, and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) lost, by age group (aged <75 years, ≥ 75 years, and in total) and 
country income level (high-income and low-income and middle-income) for 1990, 
2005, and 2010.
FINDINGS: We included 119 studies (58 from high-income countries and 61 from 
low-income and middle-income countries). Worldwide, the burden of ischaemic and 
haemorrhagic stroke increased significantly between 1990 and 2010 in terms of 
the absolute number of people with incident ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke 
(37% and 47% increase, respectively), number of deaths (21% and 20% increase), 
and DALYs lost (18% and 14% increase). In the past two decades in high-income 
countries, incidence of ischaemic stroke reduced significantly by 13% (95% CI 
6-18), mortality by 37% (19-39), DALYs lost by 34% (16-36), and 
mortality-to-incidence ratios by 21% (10-27). For haemorrhagic stroke, incidence 
reduced significantly by 19% (1-15), mortality by 38% (32-43), DALYs lost by 39% 
(32-44), and mortality-to-incidence ratios by 27% (19-35). By contrast, in 
low-income and middle-income countries, we noted a significant increase of 22% 
(5-30) in incidence of haemorrhagic stroke and a 6% (-7 to 18) non-significant 
increase in the incidence of ischaemic stroke. Mortality rates for ischaemic 
stroke fell by 14% (9-19), DALYs lost by 17% (-11 to 21%), and 
mortality-to-incidence ratios by 16% (-12 to 22). For haemorrhagic stroke in 
low-income and middle-income countries, mortality rates reduced by 23% (-18 to 
25%), DALYs lost by 25% (-21 to 28), and mortality-to-incidence ratios by 36% 
(-34 to 28).
INTERPRETATION: Although age-standardised mortality rates for ischaemic and 
haemorrhagic stroke have decreased in the past two decades, the absolute number 
of people who have these stroke types annually, and the number with related 
deaths and DALYs lost, is increasing, with most of the burden in low-income and 
middle-income countries. Further study is needed in these countries to identify 
which subgroups of the population are at greatest risk and who could be targeted 
for preventive efforts.

BACKGROUND: New WHO guidelines recommend initiation of antiretroviral therapy 
for HIV-positive adults with CD4 counts of 500 cells per μL or less, a higher 
threshold than was previously recommended. Country decision makers have to 
decide whether to further expand eligibility for antiretroviral therapy 
accordingly. We aimed to assess the potential health benefits, costs, and 
cost-effectiveness of various eligibility criteria for adult antiretroviral 
therapy and expanded treatment coverage.
METHODS: We used several independent mathematical models in four settings-South 
Africa (generalised epidemic, moderate antiretroviral therapy coverage), Zambia 
(generalised epidemic, high antiretroviral therapy coverage), India 
(concentrated epidemic, moderate antiretroviral therapy coverage), and Vietnam 
(concentrated epidemic, low antiretroviral therapy coverage)-to assess the 
potential health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of various eligibility 
criteria for adult antiretroviral therapy under scenarios of existing and 
expanded treatment coverage, with results projected over 20 years. Analyses 
assessed the extension of eligibility to include individuals with CD4 counts of 
500 cells per μL or less, or all HIV-positive adults, compared with the previous 
(2010) recommendation of initiation with CD4 counts of 350 cells per μL or less. 
We assessed costs from a health-system perspective, and calculated the 
incremental cost (in US$) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted to 
compare competing strategies. Strategies were regarded very cost effective if 
the cost per DALY averted was less than the country's 2012 per-head gross 
domestic product (GDP; South Africa: $8040; Zambia: $1425; India: $1489; 
Vietnam: $1407) and cost effective if the cost per DALY averted was less than 
three times the per-head GDP.
FINDINGS: In South Africa, the cost per DALY averted of extending eligibility 
for antiretroviral therapy to adult patients with CD4 counts of 500 cells per μL 
or less ranged from $237 to $1691 per DALY averted compared with 2010 
guidelines. In Zambia, expansion of eligibility to adults with a CD4 count 
threshold of 500 cells per μL ranged from improving health outcomes while 
reducing costs (ie, dominating the previous guidelines) to $749 per DALY 
averted. In both countries results were similar for expansion of eligibility to 
all HIV-positive adults, and when substantially expanded treatment coverage was 
assumed. Expansion of treatment coverage in the general population was also cost 
effective. In India, the cost for extending eligibility to all HIV-positive 
adults ranged from $131 to $241 per DALY averted, and in Vietnam extending 
eligibility to patients with CD4 counts of 500 cells per μL or less cost $290 
per DALY averted. In concentrated epidemics, expanded access for key populations 
was also cost effective.
INTERPRETATION: Our estimates suggest that earlier eligibility for 
antiretroviral therapy is very cost effective in low-income and middle-income 
settings, although these estimates should be revisited when more data become 
available. Scaling up antiretroviral therapy through earlier eligibility and 
expanded coverage should be considered alongside other high-priority health 
interventions competing for health budgets.

BACKGROUND: WHO's 2013 revisions to its Consolidated Guidelines on 
antiretroviral drugs recommend routine viral load monitoring, rather than 
clinical or immunological monitoring, as the preferred monitoring approach on 
the basis of clinical evidence. However, HIV programmes in resource-limited 
settings require guidance on the most cost-effective use of resources in view of 
other competing priorities such as expansion of antiretroviral therapy coverage. 
We assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative patient monitoring strategies.
METHODS: We evaluated a range of monitoring strategies, including clinical, CD4 
cell count, and viral load monitoring, alone and together, at different 
frequencies and with different criteria for switching to second-line therapies. 
We used three independently constructed and validated models simultaneously. We 
estimated costs on the basis of resource use projected in the models and 
associated unit costs; we quantified impact as disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) averted. We compared alternatives using incremental cost-effectiveness 
analysis.
FINDINGS: All models show that clinical monitoring delivers significant benefit 
compared with a hypothetical baseline scenario with no monitoring or switching. 
Regular CD4 cell count monitoring confers a benefit over clinical monitoring 
alone, at an incremental cost that makes it affordable in more settings than 
viral load monitoring, which is currently more expensive. Viral load monitoring 
without CD4 cell count every 6-12 months provides the greatest reductions in 
morbidity and mortality, but incurs a high cost per DALY averted, resulting in 
lost opportunities to generate health gains if implemented instead of increasing 
antiretroviral therapy coverage or expanding antiretroviral therapy eligibility.
INTERPRETATION: The priority for HIV programmes should be to expand 
antiretroviral therapy coverage, firstly at CD4 cell count lower than 350 cells 
per μL, and then at a CD4 cell count lower than 500 cells per μL, using 
lower-cost clinical or CD4 monitoring. At current costs, viral load monitoring 
should be considered only after high antiretroviral therapy coverage has been 
achieved. Point-of-care technologies and other factors reducing costs might make 
viral load monitoring more affordable in future.

BACKGROUND: Frozen shoulder has always been considered important because of the 
impact on the quality-of-life and long period of illness. Therefore, the use of 
noninvasive and safe techniques that can speed up the healing process of the 
disease is important.
