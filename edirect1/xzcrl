BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that papillary-thyroid-microcarcinomas (PTMi) 
and follicular-variant-papillary-thyroid-cancers (FVPTC) are less aggressive 
overall. Our observations argue against.
OBJECTIVES: To assess whether PTMi and FVPTC are indeed low-risk and could be 
safely followed without intervention.
METHODS: We prospectively collected data of subjects with PTC on pathology 
post-thyroidectomy. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with Fisher's exact test 
and differences between means were calculated using Mann Whitney's test.
RESULTS: 696 met inclusion-criteria; 436 had macrocarcinomas (PTMa) and 260 had 
PTMi. PTMa were statistically significantly more likely to present multifocal 
[44.0% vs.28.1%], with extrathyroidal extension [22.1% vs.3.4%], lymph nodes 
involvement [25.5% vs.8.8%] and local invasion [3.1% vs.0.4%] (p < 0.05 for 
all), but not with distant metastasis [3.4% vs.1.3%, p > 0.05]. Therefore, PTMi 
measuring down to 0.01 cm, harbored aggressive features. We also identified 174 
cases with FVPTC and 522 subjects with non-FVPTC. FVPTC had lower incidence of 
multifocality [40.1%, vs.60.9%], extrathyroidal extension [8.6% vs.17.4%] and 
lymphatic involvement [5.2% vs.24.0%], but not distant metastasis or local 
invasion [p > 0.05 for all]. Therefore, FVPTC measuring down to 0.5 cm, also 
harbored aggressive features.
CONCLUSIONS: PTMi and FVPTC aggressive features are substantial enough to 
require careful evaluation, independent of their original tumor size before 
defaulting to just "active surveillance."

BACKGROUND: Faecal immunochemical test (FIT)-based colorectal cancer screening 
requires successive rounds for maximum preventive effect. Advanced neoplasia can 
bleed intermittently and thus might be missed by single faecal sampling. Few 
studies have been done on two sample FIT (2-FIT) screening over multiple rounds. 
Therefore, we compared multiple rounds of one sample FIT (1-FIT) with 2-FIT 
screening with respect to participation, positive predictive value (PPV), 
diagnostic yield, and interval colorectal cancer.
METHODS: In this population-based study, a random selection of asymptomatic 
individuals aged 50-74 years in the Rotterdam-Rijnmond region, Netherlands, were 
invited by post for four rounds (every 2 years) of 1-FIT or 2-FIT screening. Key 
exclusion criteria were a history or colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel 
disease, colon imaging in the previous 2 years, and life expectancy of less than 
5 years. Per round, invitees received one or two FITs to sample either one or 
two consecutive bowel movements. OC-Sensor Micro (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd, 
Japan) FITs were used by all participants, except the fourth round of screening 
for the 1-FIT cohort, for which participants used either an OC-Sensor or a 
FOB-Gold (Sentinel Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). A faecal haemoglobin cutoff 
concentration of 10 μg/g of faeces in at least one test was used for referral 
for colonoscopy.
FINDINGS: Between 2006 and 2015, of 10 008 invited individuals for the 1-FIT 
cohort, 9787 were eligible for inclusion, of whom 7310 participated at least 
once in four successive rounds. Of 3197 invited individuals for the 2-FIT 
cohort, 3131 were eligible for inclusion, and 2269 participated at least once in 
four successive rounds. In the 1-FIT screening cohort, 74·7% (7310 of 9787) of 
invitees participated at least once versus 72·5% (2269 of 3131) of invitees in 
the 2-FIT cohort (p=0·013). Among participants who participated at least once, 
the cumulative positivity rate over four rounds was 19·2% (1407 of 7310) for the 
1-FIT cohort versus 28·5% (647 of 2269) for the 2-FIT cohort (p<0·0001). The 
cumulative PPV for advanced neoplasia was 33·0% (432 of 1308 colonoscopies) for 
the 1-FIT cohort versus 24·2% (147 of 607 colonoscopies) for the 2-FIT cohort 
(p<0·0001). The cumulative diagnostic yield of advanced neoplasia among invited 
individuals was 4·4% (432 of 9787) for 1-FIT versus 4·7% (147 of 3131) for 2-FIT 
screening (p=0·46)). FIT interval colorectal cancers were detected in eight 
(0·1%) of 7310 participants in the 1-FIT cohort and two (0·1%) of 2269 with 
2-FIT screening (p=1·00).
INTERPRETATION: Four rounds of 2-FIT screening with a low faecal haemoglobin 
cutoff level did not result in a significant increase in diagnostic yield or a 
decrease in interval colorectal cancers compared with 1-FIT, despite higher 
colonoscopy demand. Therefore, 1-FIT colorectal cancer screening programmes 
should be preferred.
FUNDING: None.

Familial Parkinson's disease (PD) protein DJ-1 mutations are linked to early 
onset PD. We have found that DJ-1 binds directly to the F1FO ATP synthase β 
subunit. DJ-1's interaction with the β subunit decreased mitochondrial 
uncoupling and enhanced ATP production efficiency while in contrast mutations in 
DJ-1 or DJ-1 knockout increased mitochondrial uncoupling, and depolarized 
neuronal mitochondria. In mesencephalic DJ-1 KO cultures, there was a 
progressive loss of neuronal process extension. This was ameliorated by a 
pharmacological reagent, dexpramipexole, that binds to ATP synthase, closing a 
mitochondrial inner membrane leak and enhancing ATP synthase efficiency. ATP 
synthase c-subunit can form an uncoupling channel; we measured, therefore, ATP 
synthase F1 (β subunit) and c-subunit protein levels. We found that ATP synthase 
β subunit protein level in the DJ-1 KO neurons was approximately half that found 
in their wild-type counterparts, comprising a severe defect in ATP synthase 
stoichiometry and unmasking c-subunit. We suggest that DJ-1 enhances 
dopaminergic cell metabolism and growth by its regulation of ATP synthase 
protein components.

Stereotypes are abundant in everyday life - and whereas their influence on 
cognitive and motor performance is well documented, a causal role in pain 
processing is still elusive. Nevertheless, previous studies have implicated 
gender-related stereotype effects in pain perception as potential mediators 
partly accounting for sex effects on pain. An influence of stereotypes on pain 
seems indeed likely as pain measures have proven especially susceptible to 
expectancy effects such as placebo effects. However, so far empirical approaches 
to stereotype effects on pain are correlational rather than experimental. In 
this study, we aimed at documenting gender-related stereotypes on pain 
perception and processing by actively manipulating the participants' awareness 
of common stereotypical expectations. We discovered that gender-related 
stereotypes can significantly modulate pain perception which was mirrored by 
activity levels in pain-associated brain areas.

As life expectancy increases worldwide, age-related neurodegenerative diseases 
will increase in parallel. The lack of effective treatment strategies may 
soon lead to an unprecedented health, social and economic crisis. Any attempt to 
halt the progression of these diseases requires a thorough knowledge of the 
pathophysiological mechanisms involved to facilitate the identification of new 
targets and the application of innovative therapeutic strategies. The metzincin 
superfamily of metalloproteinases includes matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), a 
disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) and ADAM with thrombospondin motifs 
(ADAMTS). These multigenic and multifunctional proteinase families regulate the 
functions of an increasing number of signalling and scaffolding molecules 
involved in neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, protein 
misfolding, synaptic dysfunction or neuronal death. Metalloproteinases and their 
physiological inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), 
are therefore, at the crossroads of molecular and cellular mechanisms that 
support neurodegenerative processes, and emerge as potential new therapeutic 
targets. We provide an overview of current knowledge on the role and regulation 
of metalloproteinases and TIMPs in four major neurodegenerative diseases: 
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
Huntington's disease.

The aim of the 25 and Up (25Up) study was to assess a wide range of 
psychological and behavioral risk factors behind mental illness in a large 
cohort of Australian twins and their non-twin siblings. Participants had already 
been studied longitudinally from the age of 12 and most recently in the 19Up 
study (mean age = 26.1 years, SD = 4.1, range = 20-39). This subsequent wave 
follows up these twins several years later in life (mean age = 29.7 years, 
SD = 2.2, range =  22-44). The resulting data set enables additional detailed 
investigations of genetic pathways underlying psychiatric illnesses in the 
Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study (BLTS). Data were collected between 2016 and 
2018 from 2540 twins and their non-twin siblings (59% female, including 341 
monozygotic complete twin-pairs, 415 dizygotic complete pairs and 1028 non-twin 
siblings and singletons). Participants were from South-East Queensland, 
Australia, and the sample was of predominantly European ancestry. The 25Up study 
collected information on 20 different mental disorders, including depression, 
anxiety, substance use, psychosis, bipolar and attention-deficit hyper-activity 
disorder, as well as general demographic information such as occupation, 
education level, number of children, self-perceived IQ and household 
environment. In this article, we describe the prevalence, comorbidities and age 
of onset for all 20 examined disorders. The 25Up study also assessed general and 
physical health, including physical activity, sleep patterns, eating behaviors, 
baldness, acne, migraines and allergies, as well as psychosocial items such as 
suicidality, perceived stress, loneliness, aggression, sleep-wake cycle, sexual 
identity and preferences, technology and internet use, traumatic life events, 
gambling and cyberbullying. In addition, 25Up assessed female health traits such 
as morning sickness, breastfeeding and endometriosis. Furthermore, given that 
the 25Up study is an extension of previous BLTS studies, 86% of participants 
have already been genotyped. This rich resource will enable the assessment of 
epidemiological risk factors, as well as the heritability and genetic 
correlations of mental conditions.

To explore the occurrence and development of cardiac arrest guided by the needs 
of patients with cardiac arrest. We improved the survival chain promulgated by 
American Heart Association, and made it run through the whole life cycle of 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The concept of survival cycle of CPR in 
China was launched. Considering from the whole cycle of it, moved forward or 
delayed, the cardiac arrest line was divided into pre-arrest phase, intra-arrest 
phase and post-resuscitation phase. The main content is "three-prevention" 
policies (precaution, pre-warning and early identification), "three-ways" 
strategies (standardization, diversification and individuation) and "three 
lives" general plans (demutation, transcending and extension). Survival cycle of 
CPR with Chinese characteristics was constructed with prevention, curation and 
relieve in cardiac arrest line.

The concept of a reference case, first proposed by the US Panel on 
Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, has been used to specify the required 
methodological features of economic evaluations of healthcare interventions. In 
the case of gene therapy, there is a difference of opinion on whether a specific 
methodological reference case is required. The aim of this article was to 
provide a more detailed analysis of the characteristics of gene therapy and the 
extent to which these characteristics warrant modifications to the methods 
suggested in general reference cases for economic evaluation. We argue that a 
completely new reference case is not required, but propose a tailored checklist 
that can be used by analysts and decision makers to determine which aspects of 
economic evaluation should be considered further, given the unique nature of 
gene therapy.

BACKGROUND: The popularity of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) has been 
resistant to concerns about validity and reliability. Utility-theoretic outcome 
equivalents are widely used in other areas of applied economics. Equivalence 
values can be derived for time, money, risk, and other metrics. These 
equivalence measures preserve all available information about individual 
preferences and are valid measures of individual welfare changes.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to derive alternative generalized 
equivalence measures from first principles and illustrate their application in 
an empirical comparative-effectiveness example.
METHODS: We specify a general-equilibrium model incorporating neoclassical 
utility functions, health production function, severity-duration preferences, 
and labor-market tradeoff function. The empirical implementation takes advantage 
of discrete-choice experiment methods that are widely accepted in other areas of 
applied economics and increasingly in health economics. We illustrate the 
practical significance of restrictive QALY assumptions using 
comparative-effectiveness results based on both QALYs and estimates of 
welfare-theoretic time-equivalent values for anti-tumor necrosis factor and 
prolonged corticosteroid treatments for Crohn's disease in three distinct 
preference classes.
RESULTS: The QALY difference between the two treatments is 0.2 months, while 
time-equivalent values range between 0.5 and 1.3 months for aggregate and 
class-specific differences. Thus, the QALY-based analysis understates 
welfare-theoretic values by 60%-85%.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that using disease-specific equivalence values 
offer a meaningful alternative to QALYs to compare global outcomes across 
treatments. The equivalence values approach is consistent with principles of 
welfare economics and offers several features not represented in QALYs, 
including accounting for preference nonlinearities in disease severity and 
duration, inclusion of preference-relevant nonclinical healthcare factors, 
representing preferences of clinically-relevant patient subpopulations, and 
including utility losses related to risk aversion.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy among schizophrenic patients is 20% shorter than the 
general population. Currently, long-term use of antipsychotic drugs can induce 
metabolic symptoms, including weight gain, glucose intolerance, high blood 
glucose.
AIM: This research aimed to investigate the fasting blood sugar level of a male 
patient with schizophrenia treated with flexible dose.
METHODS: This research is an experimental study, unpaired numerical comparative 
analytic with non-probability consecutive sampling by recruiting 50 research 
subjects of men with male patients with schizophrenia. Every 25 people were 
treated with aripiprazole, and another 25 subjects were treated with 
risperidone. The flexible dose on how doses are equated with bioequivalent doses 
between aripiprazole and risperidone was applied. Sampling was carried out in 
the inpatient and outpatient clinic of the psychiatric hospital Prof. Dr M. 
Ildrem Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia, in a span of 6 months from January 2018 
to July 2018. The diagnostic test used a Mini structured interview system 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases-10 (Mini-ICD 10) and the 
statistical analysis was involving Mann Whitney U Test.
RESULTS: This research showed the mean of fasting blood sugar level in week 8 in 
the group receiving treatment with aripiprazole was 88.96 with a standard 
deviation of 4.33 and in the group receiving risperidone treatment was 102.80 
with a standard deviation of 2.92. The results of the analysis using unpaired 
t-test in the two groups showed a significant difference in fasting blood sugar 
levels for men with schizophrenia in the group receiving aripiprazole treatment 
and the group receiving risperidone treatment in week 8 with a value of p < 
0.001 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This research revealed that based on the equivalence of risperidone 
and aripiprazole dosage given to the male patients with schizophrenia, the 
treatment using risperidone can significantly increase the fasting blood sugar 
level compared to the aripiprazole treatment in week 8.

BACKGROUND: The most common neonatal tumor is neuroblastoma and adrenal gland is 
the most common site of involvement. 11-26% of this tumor is seen in the thorax 
of neonates. Due to a similar appearance of the mediastinal tumor with 
pneumonia, a high index of suspicion is necessary for early diagnosis of this 
disorder.
CASE REPORT: A 17-day -old female and term neonate delivered by caesarian 
section was reported in the study. The mother had a normal pregnancy without any 
reported complications. The newborn admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit 
(NICU) in her hometown, because of respiratory distress, stridor, and tachypnea 
which was started from 7 days of life and due to lack of recovery and persistent 
respiratory symptoms, the patient referred to our hospital. In chest X-ray, 
opacity in the right upper lobe of the lung was seen. In barium study, a mass 
like lesion in the size of 35.34 mm adjacent to upper intra-thoracic esophagus 
with mild mass effect was observed and in CTS a posterior mediastinal mass with 
severe compression on the trachea and extension to the spinal canal was 
reported. Due to severe obstruction on the airway, the baby underwent emergency 
surgery and a mediastinal mass with adhesion and involvement of the ribs and 
spinal cord was resected. The final diagnosis of poorly differentiated 
neuroblastoma was confirmed by biopsy.
CONCLUSION: In every neonate with persistent respiratory distress, stridor and 
abnormal chest X-ray, diagnosis of neonatal neuroblastoma should be considered.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Advances in the medical management of HIV infection have 
increased life expectancy and reduced the mortality rate of infected 
individuals. As a result, dental and medical health-care workers have a higher 
chance to meet HIV-positive patients in their clinics. People living with HIV 
and AIDS (PLWHA) are frequently experiencing discrimination. That negative 
attitude toward HIV remains quite common among health-care professionals. The 
purpose of this study was to assess students' attitudes toward PLWHA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was a cross-sectional survey to assess 
the attitudes of senior dental students toward HIV/AIDS in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. 
Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire. Data 
analysis was done using the statistical package of social sciences. Descriptive 
statistics including means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages 
were calculated and used to present the data. A binary logistic regression model 
was constructed to estimate the effect of different predictors on the level of 
HIV-related discrimination.
RESULTS: A total of 400 individuals took part in the study. Bivariate analysis 
of HIV discrimination in relation to other variables showed that those reluctant 
to treat HIV patients, the majority (82%) showed a negative tendency toward 
HIV/AIDS patients, while 75% who were willing to treat them exhibited more 
positive attitudes, which was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). The 
discrimination was high, almost 87%, among those who feared accidental exposure 
to HIV patients; however, 73% of those who did not experience fear, felt 
nondiscriminative, which was also statistically significant (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Stigmatizing views toward PLWHA exist among senior dental students 
in Jeddah. The most significant predictors of discrimination included fear of 
accidental exposure, reluctance to provide treatment to these patients, and 
self-protective concerns.

Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) were synthesized by green protocol using 
Mimusops elengi fruit extract as a novel natural resource. The synthesized 
particles were polyhedral (mostly hexagonal) in shape between 14 - 48 nm with an 
average size of 24.75 ± 0.78 nm. Nano zinc oxide (ZnO) at concentrations of 2% 
(w/w) and 4% (w/w), were incorporated into agar matrix. Solution casting method 
was used to fabricate the bionanocomposite films with ZnONPs in agar. Surface 
morphology, particle size, crystallinity, thermal stability and functional 
groups were determined using SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA and FTIR, respectively. Loading 
of ZnONPs in composite films improved thermal stability, elongation and film 
thickness, whereas tensile strength and transparency decreased. The films were 
used for packaging of green grapes, and appearance of the fruit was observed 
during ambient storage. Grapes packaged in composite films showed fresh 
appearance up to 14 and 21 days in ambient conditions for 2% (w/w) and 4% (w/w) 
ZnONPs in films, respectively. The results showed the potential of the 
fabricated agar-ZnO nanocomposite film as a promising packaging material to 
enhance postharvest shelf-life of fresh fruits like green grapes.

Salinomycin with antibacterial and anticoccidial activities is a commercial 
polyether polyketide widely used in animal husbandry as a food additive. 
Malonyl-CoA (MCoA), methylmalonyl-CoA (MMCoA), and ethylmalonyl-CoA (EMCoA) are 
used as extension units in its biosynthesis. To understand how the salinomycin 
modular polyketide synthase (PKS) strictly discriminates among these extension 
units, the acyltransferase (AT) domains selecting MCoA, MMCoA, and EMCoA were 
structurally characterized. Molecular dynamics simulations of the AT structures 
helped to reveal the key interactions involved in enzyme-substrate recognitions, 
which enabled the engineering of AT mutants with switched specificity. The 
catalytic efficiencies ( kcat/ Km) of these AT mutants are comparable with those 
of the wild-type AT domains. These results set the stage for engineering the AT 
substrate specificity of modular PKSs.

Background Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare disease caused 
by pathogenic variants in the LMNA gene, which leads to premature aging. The 
median life expectancy is shortened to 13 years due to cardiovascular 
complications. Case report We present a boy born with a pathogenic LMNA variant 
c.433G > A, which causes atypical progeria syndrome (APS) and was previously 
described in one single patient. When investigated for poor growth prior to the 
diagnosis of APS, his laboratory tests revealed growth hormone (GH) deficiency 
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the midbrain showed partial empty sella. 
GH treatment had only a limited and transient effect. His first ischemic 
complication manifested at age 4.2 years; at the age of 7 years, he had a fatal 
haemorrhagic stroke. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
patient with APS showing partial empty sella and GH deficiency that might have 
contributed to his poor growth. GH failed to improve long-term outcome.

INTRODUCTION: While trials have demonstrated non-inferiority of direct oral 
anticoagulant drugs (DOAC) to low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) for the 
treatment of cancer associated thrombosis (CAT), it is unclear if the newer 
intervention is cost-effective.
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis using a Markov state-transition 
model over a time horizon of 60 months in a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old 
patients with active malignancy and first acute symptomatic CAT who were 
eligible to receive either rivaroxaban/edoxaban or dalteparin. We obtained 
transition probability, relative risk, cost, and utility inputs from the 
literature. We estimated the differential impact on costs and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) per patient and performed one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results.
RESULTS: Using the base-case analysis over 60 months, DOAC versus dalteparin was 
associated with an incremental cost reduction of $24,129 with an incremental 
QALY reduction of 0.04. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the cost of 
dalteparin contributed the most to the incremental cost difference; relative 
risk of death related to underlying cancer contributed the most of the 
incremental QALY difference. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed 
the base-case analysis, with a large reduction in cost but small reduction in 
QALYs.
CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban or edoxaban as compared to dalteparin is cost saving 
from a payer's perspective for the treatment of CAT. Professional organizations 
and healthcare systems may want to consider this analysis in future practice 
recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Treatment options are limited for patients with advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that progresses after treatment with sorafenib. 
Cabozantinib, an oral small molecule inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase 
receptors, recently showed improved overall survival (OS) compared with placebo 
in sorafenib-pretreated patients with advanced HCC in the CELESTIAL trial. This 
study assessed the cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib for second-line treatment 
of patients with advanced HCC from a US healthcare system perspective.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cost and utility data were extracted from the CELESTIAL 
trial and used to determine the cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib compared with 
placebo plus best supportive care. The main outcome of this study was the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by using cabozantinib compared with 
placebo plus best supportive care in sorafenib-pretreated HCC.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis using data from the CELESTIAL trial, the 
incremental QALY and ICER were 0.067 and $1,040,675 for cabozantinib compared 
with placebo and best supportive care. OS reported in the CELESTIAL trial 
(hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.92) had the strongest association with the 
ICER. In one-way sensitivity analyses, there were no scenarios in which 
cabozantinib was cost-effective. In a cost-threshold analysis, cabozantinib 
would have to be priced at least $50 per pill to be cost-effective considering a 
willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY. Although the CELESTIAL trial 
demonstrated that cabozantinib improves OS compared with placebo in patients 
with HCC that progresses after treatment with sorafenib, our analysis shows that 
cabozantinib is not a cost-effective therapy in this scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: At current costs, cabozantinib is not cost-effective for 
second-line therapy of HCC in the United States.

The positive life-prolonging effect of physical activity is often used as a 
promotion argument to motivate people to change their behaviour. Yet the 
decision of investing in health by exercising depends not only on the potential 
health effect but also on the costs of physical activity including time costs 
and the individual's (dis)utility of performing physical activity. The objective 
of this study was to investigate the trade-off between costs and benefits of 
engaging in physical activity. A web-based stated preference experiment was 
conducted to elicit individual preferences for physical activity among a 
representative sample of the Danish population, 18-60 years of age, categorised 
as moderately physically active or physically inactive. The results of the study 
suggest that perceived negative quality of life impact of physical activity is 
an important predictor of the choice of not attending physical activity, and 
hence should be acknowledged as a barrier to engaging in physical activity. 
Furthermore, we find time costs to have a significant impact on stated uptake. 
For individuals categorised as moderately active, the marginal health effect of 
physical activity is significant but minor. For inactive individuals, this 
effect is insignificant suggesting that information on long-term health effects 
does not work as motivation for engaging in exercise for this group. Instead, 
focus should be on reducing the perceived disutility of physical activity.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although endovascular thrombectomy combined with 
recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator is effective for treatment of 
acute ischemic stroke, regional disparities in implementation rates of those 
treatments have been reported. Drive and retrieve system, where a qualified 
neurointerventionist travels to another primary stroke center for endovascular 
thrombectomy, has been practiced in parts of Hokkaido, Japan. This study aims to 
simulate the cost effectiveness of the drive and retrieve system, which can be a 
method to enhance equality and cost effectiveness of treatments for acute 
ischemic stroke.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The number of patients who had acute ischemic stroke in 
2015 is estimated. Those patients are generated according to the population 
distribution, and thereafter patient transport time is analyzed in the 3 
scenarios (1) 60-minute drive scenario, (2) 90-minute drive scenario, in which 
the drive and retrieve system operates within 60-minute or 90-minute driving 
distance (3) without the system, using geographic information system. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness rate, quality-adjusted life years, and medical 
and nursing care costs are estimated from the analyzed transport time.
FINDINGS: The incremental cost-effectiveness rate by implementing the system was 
dominant. Cost reductions of $213,190 in 60-minute drive scenario, and $247,274 
in the 90-minute scenario were expected, respectively. Such benefits are the 
most significant in Soya, Emmon, Rumoi, and Kamikawahokubu medical areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The drive and retrieve system could enhance regional equality and 
cost effectiveness of ischemic stroke treatments in Hokkaido, which can be 
achieved using existing resources. Further studies are required to clarify its 
cost effectiveness from hospital perspective.

Spontaneous enterocutaneous fistulae are a rare complication in patients with 
cancer, especially following irradiation, chemotherapy or cytoreductive 
operations. They are associated with worse prognosis, higher costs of treatment 
and impaired quality of life. Proper recognition of the problem and fast 
implementation of selective therapy including water electrolyte resuscitation, 
infection control, nutritional support, control of output volume, proper wound 
care and, ultimately, surgical treatment in selected patients may result in 
better symptom relief and improved quality of life of patients. We describe a 
case of a patient with advanced rectal cancer and acute pain in the lateral 
aspect of thigh caused by the presumptive presence of an enterocutaneous 
fistula, in whom therapy with antibiotics and surgical incision enabled rapid 
pain relief and comfort of dying.
