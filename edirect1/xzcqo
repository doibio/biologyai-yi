study completion at day 30. PCE supplementation significantly decreased mean 
preprandial glucose levels only in Group II at Days 24 (Initial - Day 
24 = 13.00 mg/dL, 95% CI: 1.407-24.59, P = 0.0345) and 30 (Initial - Day 
30 = 13.67 mg/dL, 95% CI: 5.766-21.57, P = 0.0067). In cell-based assays, PCE 
enhanced glucose uptake in L6 myocytes and inhibited hepatocyte glucose 
production HepG2 cells. In cell-free assays, PCE inhibited α-amylase activity 
and α-glucosidase activity.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the therapeutic utility of PCE for 
maintaining healthy glucose metabolism and warrant further larger-scale clinical 
trials.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was retrospectively registered in the ISRCTN

Incorporating Household Spillovers in Cost Utility Analysis: A Case Study Using 
Behavior Change in COPD.

OBJECTIVES: It is important to capture all health effects of interventions in 
cost-utility analyses conducted under a societal or healthcare perspective. 
However, this is rarely done. Household spillovers (health effects on patients' 
other household members) may be particularly likely in the context of 
technologies and interventions to change behaviors that are interdependent in 
the household. Our objective was to prospectively collect outcome data from 
household members and illustrate how these can be included in a cost-utility 
analysis of a behavior change intervention in chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD).
METHODS: Data were collected from patients' household members (n = 153) 
alongside a randomized controlled trial of a COPD self-management intervention. 
The impact of the intervention on household members' EQ-5D-5L scores (primary 
outcome), was evaluated. Analyses were then carried out to estimate household 
members' quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and assess the impact of including 
these QALYs on cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The intervention had a negligible spillover on household members' 
EQ-5D-5L scores (-0.007; p = .75). There were also no statistically significant 
spillovers at the 5 percent level in household member secondary outcomes. In the 
base-case model, the inclusion of household member QALYs in the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) denominator marginally increased the ICER from 
GBP 10,271 (EUR 13,146) to GBP 10,991 (EUR 14,068) per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates it is feasible to prospectively collect and 
include household members' outcome data in cost utility analysis, although the 
study highlighted several methodological issues. In this case, the intervention 
did not impact significantly on household members' health or health behaviors, 
but inclusion of household spillovers may make a difference in other contexts.

Schizophrenia patients have significantly lower life expectancy than the general 
population. Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic to reduce the 
mortality rate in these patients. Here, we report a schizophrenic patient with 
clozapine-induced myocarditis and successful retrial. In the first trial, 
clozapine was discontinued due to myocarditis. In the second trial, the 
titration rate was slower, and sodium valproate was not coadministered with 
clozapine. The patient has not developed myocarditis over 3.5 years of 
observation. It may be possible to take clozapine for a long time even after 
clozapine-induced myocarditis, and thus improve the life expectancy of 
schizophrenia patients.

OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the evolution of regional and socioeconomic 
inequality in life expectancy (LE) at birth and the probability of living up to 
40 (LU40) and up to 60 years of age (LU60) in Brazilian municipalities between 
1991 and 2010.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the last three national census (1991, 2000 and 
2010) computed for the 5565 Brazilian municipalities. They were divided into 
centiles according to the average per capita income. Poisson regression was 
performed to calculate the ratios between the poorest and the richest centiles.
RESULTS: The average LE (+ 8.8 years), LU40 [6.7 percentage points (pp)] and 
LU60 increased (12.2 pp) between 1991 and 2010. The ratio of LE between the 1% 
of richest counties and the 1% of poorest counties decreased from 1.20 in 1991 
to 1.09 in 2010. While in the poorest municipalities there was a gain of around 
12 years of life, among the richest this increase was around 7 years.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a remarkable decrease in regional and socioeconomic 
inequality in LE, LU40 and LU60 in Brazil between 1991 and 2010.

BACKGROUND: Despite antiretroviral treatment (ART) being an efficacious 
treatment for HIV, essentially making it a chronic non-terminal illness, two 
related and frequent concerns for many people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) 
continue to be HIV-related stigma and life stress. These two variables are 
frequently associated with depression, substance use, and poorer functional 
health. Studies to date have not fully examined the degree to which these 
constructs may be associated within one model, which could reveal a more nuanced 
understanding of how HIV-related stigma and life stress affect functional health 
in PLWHA.
METHODS: The current study employed hybrid structural equation modeling to 
examine the interconnectedness and potential indirect relationships of 
HIV-related stigma and life stress to worse health through substance use and 
depression, controlling for ART adherence and age. Participants were 240 
HIV-infected individuals who completed a biopsychosocial assessment battery upon 
screening for an RCT on treating depression in those infected with HIV.
RESULTS: Both HIV-related stigma and stressful life events were directly related 
to depression, and depression was directly related to health. There were 
significant indirect effects from stigma and stress to health via depression. 
There were no significant effects involving substance use.
CONCLUSION: It is important to continue to develop ways to address stigma, 
stressful life events, and their effects on distress in those living with HIV. 
Expanding our knowledge of disease progression risk factors beyond ART adherence 
is important to be able to design adjuvant interventions, particularly because 
treatment means that people living with HIV have markedly improved life 
expectancy and that successful treatment means that HIV is not transmittable to 
others.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by short 
stature, low lean body mass, muscular hypotonia, mental retardation, behavioral 
abnormalities, dysmorphic features, and excessive appetite with progressive 
obesity. It is caused by lack of expression of genes on the paternally inherited 
chromosome 15q11.2-q13. This genetic disorder has an estimated prevalence that 
ranges between 1/10,000-1/30,000. Hypothalamic dysfunction is a common finding 
in PWS and it has been implicated in several manifestations of this syndrome 
such as hyperphagia, temperature instability, high pain threshold, sleep 
disordered breathing, and multiple endocrine abnormalities. These include growth 
hormone deficiency, central adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, 
and obesity often complicated by type 2 diabetes. The aim of this manuscript is 
to overview the current literature on metabolic and endocrine complications of 
PWS, focusing on human studies and providing insights on the physio pathological 
mechanisms. A careful management of metabolic and endocrine complications can 
contribute to improve quality of life, prevent complications, and prolong life 
expectancy of PW patients.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy for cystic fibrosis (CF) has increased in recent 
decades, more individuals with CF are becoming parents. The objectives of this 
study were to describe the parenting and reproductive health concerns of 
individuals with CF and to identify the psychosocial and educational needs 
related to parenthood with CF.
METHODS: Twenty adults with CF, including parents and non-parents, participated 
in one-on-one, semi-structured interviews about reproductive health and 
parenting. Questions pertained to reproductive health knowledge, psychosocial 
adaptation to CF related to fertility and parenthood, parenting concerns in the 
context of CF, and psychosocial care needs. We performed thematic content 
analysis on interview transcripts and descriptive statistical analysis on 
participant demographics and health variables.
RESULTS: A majority of participants (ten women and ten men, of whom half were 
parents) described their health as "stable" and "good/fair"; median FEV 1 was 
66% predicted (range, 30-105). Participants shared a range of experiences 
related to reproductive health discussions with CF care providers and expressed 
concerns about pregnancy, infertility, and adoption. Parents and non-parents 
expressed concerns about balancing roles as parent and patient, the impact of 
anticipated health decline and early mortality on children, and communication 
with children. Participants identified a need for earlier, improved education 
for potential parents and resources for parents with CF.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with CF may not receive sufficient CF-related 
reproductive health education, and they have wide-ranging concerns about the 
intersecting roles of patient and parent. Results from this study can provide 
guidance for CF care providers to improve their understanding and response to 
the needs of individuals and families affected by CF.

Background: An estimated 11,350 uterine cancer deaths are projected to occur in 
the United States in 2018. We constructed an economic model to estimate the 
annual productivity costs associated with uterine cancer death, for the year 
2014. Materials and Methods: The model calculated the number of women who would 
be alive in 2014 if they had not died of uterine cancer, and the lost earnings 
resulting from early mortality. The age-stratified number of deaths from uterine 
cancer per year (1935-2014) was obtained from the National Center for Health 
Statistics. Life expectancy by birth year was used to determine the probability 
of survival to the age the patient would have been in 2014, had she not died of 
uterine cancer. The proportion of patients employed and median annual wage and 
fringe benefits per year were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 
primary model outcome was the total annual productivity costs attributable to 
uterine cancer deaths in 2014. Results: A total of 558,717 women in the United 
States died of uterine cancer between 1935 and 2014. The model estimated that 
110,792 of these women would be alive in 2014 had they not died of uterine 
cancer; of these, 24,758 would have been part of the work force based on age and 
labor participation rate. The total productivity loss in 2014 due to uterine 
cancer was estimated at $1.35 billion. Conclusion: Uterine cancer deaths in the 
United States are associated with substantial indirect costs owing to lost 
earnings. Total productivity losses are more than half of the estimated annual 
direct costs of uterine cancer care.

Background. Although there is a large literature examining the relationship 
between a wide range of political economy exposures and health outcomes, the 
extent to which the different aspects of political economy influence health, and 
through which mechanisms and in what contexts, is only partially understood. The 
areas in which there are few high-quality studies are also unclear. Objectives. 
To systematically review the literature describing the impact of political 
economy on population health. Search Methods. We undertook a systematic review 
of reviews, searching MEDLINE, Embase, International Bibliography of the Social 
Sciences, ProQuest Public Health, Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social 
Sciences Index and Abstracts, EconLit, SocINDEX, Web of Science, and the gray 
literature via Google Scholar. Selection Criteria. We included studies that were 
a review of the literature. Relevant exposures were differences or changes in 
policy, law, or rules; economic conditions; institutions or social structures; 
or politics, power, or conflict. Relevant outcomes were any overall measure of 
population health such as self-assessed health, mortality, life expectancy, 
survival, morbidity, well-being, illness, ill health, and life span. Two authors 
independently reviewed all citations for relevance. Data Collection and 
Analysis. We undertook critical appraisal of all included reviews by using 
modified Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 
criteria and then synthesized narratively giving greater weight to the 
higher-quality reviews. Main Results. From 4912 citations, we included 58 
reviews. Both the quality of the reviews and the underlying studies within the 
reviews were variable. Social democratic welfare states, higher public spending, 
fair trade policies, extensions to compulsory education provision, microfinance 
initiatives in low-income countries, health and safety policy, improved access 
to health care, and high-quality affordable housing have positive impacts on 
population health. Neoliberal restructuring seems to be associated with 
increased health inequalities and higher income inequality with lower self-rated 
health and higher mortality. Authors' Conclusions. Politics, economics, and 
public policy are important determinants of population health. Countries with 
social democratic regimes, higher public spending, and lower income inequalities 
have populations with better health. There are substantial gaps in the 
synthesized evidence on the relationship between political economy and health, 
and there is a need for higher-quality reviews and empirical studies in this 
area. However, there is sufficient evidence in this review, if applied through 
policy and practice, to have marked beneficial health impacts. Public Health 
Implications. Policymakers should be aware that social democratic welfare state 
types, countries that spend more on public services, and countries with lower 
income inequalities have better self-rated health and lower mortality. Research 
funders and researchers should be aware that there remain substantial gaps in 
the available evidence base. One such area concerns the interrelationship 
between governance, polities, power, macroeconomic policy, public policy, and 
population health, including how these aspects of political economy generate 
social class processes and forms of discrimination that have a differential 
impact across social groups. This includes the influence of patterns of 
ownership (of land and capital) and tax policies. For some areas, there are many 
lower-quality reviews, which leave uncertainties in the relationship between 
political economy and population health, and a high-quality review is needed. 
There are also areas in which the available reviews have identified primary 
research gaps such as the impact of changes to housing policy, availability, and 
tenure.

BACKGROUND: Globally, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended as soon as 
possible after admission from an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or 
revascularisation. However, uptake is consistently poor internationally, ranging 
from 10% to 60%. The low level of uptake is compounded by variation across 
different socioeconomic groups. Policy recommendations continue to focus on 
increasing uptake and addressing inequalities in participation; however, to 
date, there is a paucity of economic evidence evaluating higher CR participation 
rates and their relevance to socioeconomic inequality.
METHODS: This study constructed a de-novo cost-effectiveness model of CR, 
utilising the results from the latest Cochrane review and national CR audit 
data. We explore the role of socioeconomic status by incorporating key 
deprivation parameters and determine the population health gains associated with 
achieving an uptake target of 65%.
RESULTS: We find that the low cost of CR and the potential for reductions in 
subsequent MI and revascularisation rates combine to make it a highly 
cost-effective intervention. While CR is less cost-effective for more deprived 
groups, the lower level of uptake in these groups makes the potential health 
gains, from achieving the target, greater. Using England as a model, we estimate 
the expenditure that could be justified while maintaining the cost-effectiveness 
of CR at £68.4 m per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing CR uptake is cost-effective and can also be implemented 
to reduce known socioeconomic inequalities. Using an estimation of potential 
population health gains and justifiable expenditure, we have produced tools with 
which policymakers and commissioners can encourage greater utilisation of CR 
services.

Injury: A LIBRE Study.

Social and emotional recovery from burn injury is a complex process impacted by 
both clinical and social factors. Because level of education (LOE) has been 
correlated to overall health, health outcomes, and life expectancy, we 
questioned whether LOE might be associated with successful social recovery after 
burn injury. The Life Impact Burn Recovery Evaluation (LIBRE) data set served as 
a novel tool to explore this question. The LIBRE project is a collaborative 
effort designed to provide a clinical yardstick for social reintegration among 
burn survivors. After institutional review board approval, 601 burn survivor 
respondents, aged 18 or over with >5% TBSA burn were surveyed and a six-scale, 
126-item LIBRE Profile was derived from their responses. LOE was collapsed into 
four categories ranging from less than high school equivalency certificate to 
graduate degree. Impact of burn injury on subsequent LOE was examined by 
splitting the sample into those burned at age 30 years or less and those burned 
at greater than 30 years of age. Regression models were run to estimate 
associations between education and scale scores with adjustment for age at 
injury, sex, marital status, work status, TBSA, and time since burn. Regression 
models were run on the entire cohort and then stratified by age at burn injury 
(≤30 vs >30). Among all subjects, we found an association between LOE and social 
recovery as measured by LIBRE scale scores. This association was contributed 
entirely from the cohort burned at age 30 or less: for those burned at greater 
than age 30, there was no association between LOE and social recovery. Of 
particular interest, the distribution of LOE among those burned at ≤ 30 was very 
similar to LOE distribution in both millennials and in the U.S. population at 
large. LOE appears to be associated with social recovery for those burned at 
younger ages but not for those burned at over age 30. More importantly, burn 
injury during schooling may have no impact on a survivor's educational 
trajectory since distribution of LOE in our ≤30 cohort mirrors that of the 
general population. LOE and age at burn injury may provide a quick screen for 
survivors at risk of difficult social reintegration, allowing providers to 
target those at risk with additional peer support and counseling.

With the increase in global life expectancy and the advance of technology, the 
creation of age-friendly environments is a priority in the design of new 
products for elderly people healthcare. This paper presents a proposal for a 
real-time health monitoring system of older adults living in geriatric 
residences. This system was developed to help caregivers to have a better 
control in monitoring the health of their patients and have closer communication 
with their patients' family members. To validate the feasibility and 
effectiveness of this proposal, a prototype was built, using a biometric 
bracelet connected to a mobile application, which allows real-time visualization 
of all the information generated by the sensors (heart rate, body temperature, 
and blood oxygenation) in the bracelet. Using these data, caregivers can make 
decisions about the health status of their patients. The evaluation found that 
the users perceived the system to be easy to learn and use, providing initial 
evidence that our proposal could improve the quality of the adult's healthcare.

The contribution of smoking-related deaths to the gender gap in life expectancy 
in Sweden between 1997 and 2016.

Aims: In recent decades, smoking-related mortality has declined among men and 
increased among women in Sweden. We estimate the contribution of smoking-related 
deaths to the narrowing of the gender gap in life expectancy in Sweden between 
1997 and 2016. Methods: We extracted population data on deaths and population 
under risk on the entire Swedish population aged 25 years and over for the 
period 1997-2016. Smoking-related mortality was assessed using an indirect 
method based on lung cancer mortality. We then estimated the contribution of 
smoking to the gender gap in life expectancy by comparing the observed life 
expectancies to life expectancies excluding smoking-related deaths. Results: The 
gender gap in life expectancy was 5.0 years in 1997 and 3.4 years in 2016. The 
gender gap narrowed by 1.6 years, of which 0.6 years were attributable to 
smoking-related deaths. Conclusions: The combination of decreasing 
smoking-related mortality among men and increasing smoking-related mortality 
among women in Sweden accounted for almost 40% of the narrowing of the gender 
gap in life expectancy during the period 1997-2016.

Life expectancy is increasing for people with intellectual disability, many of 
whom live with family. While there has been research about aging and future 
planning, there is limited evidence about the characteristics of the caregiving 
relationship. The aim of this study was to examine perspectives of caregiving 
for older people with intellectual disability and their family. A constructivist 
grounded theory approach was used, and 19 people with intellectual disability 
and 28 family members were interviewed. Caregiving was informed by transitions 
across the life course. Three interrelated concepts, Riding the Waves, Shifting 
Sands-Changing Tides, and Uncovering Horizons comprise the core components of 
the theoretical model-Navigating Ever-Changing Seas. This model informs complex, 
trans-generational relationships that impact decision-making for people with a 
long-term condition. Applications within health care indicate a need for systems 
to include individuals and their networks of care in policy, practice, research, 
and service delivery across the lifespan.

BACKGROUND: Ideally, patients' decision-making regarding surgical options should 
reflect myriad implicit values. The informed consent process is meant to ensure 
that patients' values mirror clinical decisions regarding expectations for 
outcomes, such as quality of life, life expectancy, and subsequent pain and 
suffering. However, surgeons are not always equipped to discuss patients' 
values.
METHODS: Shared decision-making is a method that could help surgeons elicit 
patients' values and subsequently improve the patient's knowledge and 
satisfaction, among other important outcomes. Yet, several barriers hinder 
implementation of shared decision-making in the clinic, such as time, 
interpersonal characteristics, and trust. To address concerns, several tools and 
approaches have been developed to increase shared decision-making in the clinic. 
This article highlights two strategies: the three-talk model and decision aids.
CONCLUSIONS: Shared decision-making is a tool that could be especially valuable 
in discussions regarding elective surgery. Further research is needed to 
determine how best to implement shared decision-making in the surgical setting. 
Without full integration of patients' values into discussions of surgical 
options, there will continue to be a disconnect between the surgical procedures, 
outcomes, and patients' values.

The Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) phase 1 dataset of the 
Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) provides an 
unprecedentedly large dataset of crop model simulations covering the global 
ice-free land surface. The dataset consists of annual data fields at a spatial 
resolution of 0.5 arc-degree longitude and latitude. Fourteen crop modeling 
groups provided output for up to 11 historical input datasets spanning 1901 to 
2012, and for up to three different management harmonization levels. Each group 
submitted data for up to 15 different crops and for up to 14 output variables. 
All simulations were conducted for purely rainfed and near-perfectly irrigated 
conditions on all land areas irrespective of whether the crop or irrigation 
system is currently used there. With the publication of the GGCMI phase 1 
dataset we aim to promote further analyses and understanding of crop model 
performance, potential relationships between productivity and environmental 
impacts, and insights on how to further improve global gridded crop model 
frameworks. We describe dataset characteristics and individual model setup 
narratives.

BACKGROUND: While older adults with pre-obesity and Class I obesity have similar 
or lower mortality risk versus those with normal weight, a heavier body mass 
index (BMI) may not translate into more healthy life years. Utilizing 
longitudinal data on 3452 older (≥60 years) Singaporeans, we assessed the 
association between BMI and years of remaining life overall with and without 
limitation in physical function and in activities of daily living (ADLs).
METHODS: Difficulty in any of nine tasks involving upper or lower extremities 
was considered as limitation in physical function, and health-related difficulty 
in any basic ADL or instrumental ADL as limitation in ADLs. We utilized 
multistate life tables, including BMI as a time-varying covariate.
RESULTS: At age 60, life expectancy (LE) was similar for those with normal 
weight, pre-obesity and obesity. However, those with obesity, versus normal 
weight, had 6.3 [95% confidence interval: 3.4-9.2] more years with limitation in 
physical function and 4.9 [3.4-6.5] less years without limitation in physical 
function. Those with pre-obesity, versus normal weight, also had 3.7 [1.9-5.3] 
more years with limitation in physical function. The same pattern across BMI 
categories was observed for years of life with and without limitation in ADLs. 
In stratified analyses, similar associations of BMI with years of life with and 
without limitation in physical function and in ADLs were observed across gender, 
ethnicity, and educational status.
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing global prevalence of obesity may result in an 
increase in years of life with limitation in physical function and in ADLs at 
older ages. Older adults, their families and healthcare systems should be 
cognizant of this issue.
