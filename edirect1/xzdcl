(p < 0.001) 53 p were SMA1B. Three copies were found in 1/6 SMA1C. Respiratory 
interventions: SRC 23 p (56.1%); SRC + NIV 8 p (19.5%); SRC + IV 10 p (24.4%). 8 
patients were already on invasive ventilation when included in the IPNM. 
Patients with invasive ventilation showed longer survival.
CONCLUSIONS: This series provides valuable information on respiratory 
intervention requirements and life expectancy in children with SMA1 before the 
implementation of novel treatments that increase the expression of the SMA 
protein.

Republic of Korea.

RATIONALE: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal-dominant disorder 
associated with a short life expectancy and various symptoms, including grip 
myotonia. Even though grip myotonia decreases quality of life, activities of 
daily living (ADLs), and work performance, very few interventions provide 
symptomatic relief.
PATIENT CONCERNS: In this case report, we present a patient with DM1 and 
gradually worsening grip myotonia. A 35-year-old woman developed grip myotonia 
at age 27. She had no underlying diseases or family history of relevant 
conditions, including DM1. She was unresponsive to medication for several years.
DIAGNOSIS: Her symptoms gradually worsened, and she was finally diagnosed with 
DM1 via genetic, neurologic, and laboratory testing in a tertiary hospital at 
age 32. She tried several medication therapies; however, she stopped medication 
at age 34 due a perceived poor response and several adverse events.
INTERVENTION: At the age of 35, she underwent 29 sessions (10 minutes per 
session) of electroacupuncture therapy on TE9 acupuncture point with 120 Hz 
electrical stimulation over 3 months.
OUTCOMES: After 3 months, relaxation time after maximal voluntary isometric 
contraction decreased from 59 to 2 seconds with treatment. Her Michigan Hand 
Outcomes Questionnaire score improved (total score, 66.6-75.9; ADL sub-score, 
59.7-73.6; function sub-score, 70-90; satisfaction sub-score, 75-91.7). Her 
Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile 2 score also improved from 4.33 to 2. 
There were no serious adverse events.
LESSONS: Electroacupuncture is a potential treatment modality and produced an 
immediate antimyotonic effect, and cumulative long-term treatment effect, in a 
patient with DM1 and grip myotonia. Other notable treatment outcomes included 
improving relaxation time, hand function, ADLs, and overall satisfaction. 
Electroacupuncture is a potential treatment modality for patients with DM1 and 
grip myotonia. Further prospective clinical studies are warranted to confirm 
this hypothesis.

Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor (WHO grade 4 
astrocytoma) with unknown causes and is associated with a reduced life 
expectancy. The available treatment options namely radiotherapy, surgery and 
chemotherapy have failed to improve life expectancy. Out of the various 
therapeutic approaches, epigenetic therapy is one of the most studied. 
Epigenetic therapy is involved in the effective treatment of GBM by inhibiting 
DNA methyltransferase, histone deacetylation and non-coding RNA. It also 
promotes the expression of the tumor suppressor gene and is involved in the 
suppression of the oncogene. Various targets are being studied to implement 
proper epigenetic regulation to control GBM effectively. Zinc is one of the 
micronutrients which is considered to maintain epigenetic regulation by 
promoting the proper DNA folding, protecting genetic material from the oxidative 
damage and controlling the enzyme activation involved in the epigenetic 
regulation. Here, we are discussing the importance of zinc in regulating the 
epigenetic modifications and assessing its role in glioblastoma research. The 
discussion also highlights the importance of artificial intelligence using 
epigenetics for envisaging the glioma progression, diagnosis and its management.

AIMS: This study quantifies geographic inequities in loss of life expectancy 
(LOLE) by area-level socioeconomic status (SES) and accessibility to treatment.
METHODS: Analysis was conducted using a population-based cancer-registry cohort 
(n = 371,570) of Queensland (Australia) residents aged 50-89 years, diagnosed 
between 1997-2016. Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate 
LOLE by area-level SES and accessibility for all invasive cancers and the five 
leading cancers. The gain in life years that could be achieved if all cancer 
patients experienced the same relative survival as those in the least 
disadvantaged-high accessibility category was estimated for the 2016 cohort.
RESULTS: For all invasive cancers, men living in the most disadvantaged areas 
lost 34 % of life expectancy due to their cancer diagnosis, while those from the 
least disadvantaged areas lost 25 %. The corresponding percentages for women 
were 33 % and 23 %. Accessibility had a lower impact on LOLE than SES, with 
patients from low accessibility areas losing 0-4 % more life expectancy than 
those from high accessibility areas. For cancer patients diagnosed in 2016 
(n = 24,423), an estimated 101,387 life years will be lost. This would be 
reduced by 19 % if all patients experienced the same relative survival as those 
from the least disadvantaged-high accessibility areas.
CONCLUSION: The impact of a cancer diagnosis on remaining life expectancy varies 
by geographical area. Establishing reasons why area disadvantage impacts on life 
expectancy is crucial to inform subsequent interventions that could increase the 
life expectancy of cancer patients from more disadvantaged areas.

Life Expectancy in Chinese Cities: Spatially Varied Role of Socioeconomic 
Development, Population Structure, and Natural Conditions.

Improving life expectancy, as well as people's health and wellbeing, is an 
important goal both for the Chinese government and the United Nations. 
Therefore, to analyze the main factors influencing life expectancy in 
prefecture-level cities in China, this study uses classical ordinary 
least-squares regression and geographical weighted regression on the data of the 
latest census. Moreover, regional differences induced by each influencing factor 
are also depicted in this study. The results demonstrate that there is 
significant heterogeneity and spatial positive correlation among the 
distribution of life expectancy in prefecture-level cities, with a generally 
higher life expectancy in the provincial capitals and eastern China, and lower 
in western China. The geographically weighted regression analysis shows that the 
economic development level, medical conditions, demographic structure, natural 
environment, and city attributes all affect the distribution of life expectancy, 
but that their effects have significant spatial heterogeneity. Life expectancy 
of the less developed areas in Western China is affected dominantly by economic 
development level, whereas medical services and education are of great 
importance in determining the life expectancy in Northern and Southern China, 
respectively. Thus, it is crucial to solve health problems based on local 
conditions, especially focusing on the improvement of health and health care in 
underdeveloped areas. Meanwhile, for the eastern developed areas, special 
attention should be paid to environmental protection in the economic process, 
while striving to achieve high-quality development.

BACKGROUND: Engagement in activities meaningful to the individual may support 
the process of recovery in those with mental illness. Persons with psychiatric 
disabilities may reduce their engagement in meaningful activities to various 
degrees with possible fluctuations over time. We hypothesized that activity 
engagement can be altered when opportunities and support are offered at an 
individual and a group peer-based level. Evidence is lacking regarding mental 
health interventions that enable engagement in meaningful activities, and 
powered effect studies are warranted.
METHODS: We propose an 8-month combined individual and group peer-based 
intervention, Meaningful Activities and Recovery (MA&R), and a study protocol 
for a multicentre two-armed parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT). The 
trial investigates the effects of MA&R in community mental health centres in 
Copenhagen and municipality services in Denmark. The trial will comprise 128 
participants with psychiatric disabilities who will be randomized to one of two 
groups: (1) MA&R in addition to standard mental healthcare or (2) standard 
mental healthcare alone. The primary outcome is self-reported activity 
engagement, measured by Profiles of Engagement in People with Severe Mental 
Illness. Secondary outcomes are recovery, functioning and quality of life. Data 
will be collected at baseline and at follow-up at the end of the intervention.
DISCUSSION: This study adds new knowledge to a field with limited evidence, i.e. 
the clinical effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions among people with 
psychiatric disabilities, directly targeting activity engagement. The pragmatic 
design, regarding in- and exclusion criteria and settings, may allow assessment 
of the intervention's effect under real-life conditions. The randomization, 
adequate power and fidelity monitoring allow testing of the intervention's 
efficacy. The multicentre study design increases the potential for 
implementation in various mental health settings if the findings are positive. 
As the nature of the intervention does not permit blinding of the participants 
or staff, it may increase the risk of expectancy and performance bias. This must 
be considered when interpreting the findings.

BACKGROUND: French laypeople's views on the allocation of organs for 
transplantation were examined.
METHODS: A total of 199 adults make judgments of priority for a liver transplant 
in 48 realistic scenarios composed of all combinations of 4 factors: 1. 
probability of success, 2. life expectancy without transplant, 3. level of 
responsibility for liver failure (eg, substance abuse in the past), and 4. 
social situation (eg, young mother with 2 young children). In all scenarios, the 
patients were in need of liver transplant. The ratings were subjected to cluster 
analysis and analyses of variance.
RESULTS: Six qualitatively different positions were found that were termed 
Probability of Success and Life Expectancy (6%), Family Responsibilities (8%), 
Family Responsibilities and Risky Behavior (28%), Risky Behavior and Family 
Responsibilities (22%), Risky Behavior (11%), and Always a Priority (25%). 
Regular church attendees expressed more often the Risky Behavior and Family 
Responsibilities position and less often the Always a Priority position than 
atheists. Female participants expressed more often the Risky Behavior position 
than male participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The French laypeople in our sample think that when assessing 
priority for transplant, criteria additional to medical urgency or the estimated 
utility in terms of expected life span after transplant should be taken into 
account. These criteria are the patient's lack of responsibility for the liver 
failure (ie, not causing it by drinking or using drugs) and the extent of the 
patient's social responsibilities (with active employment and dependents to care 
for).

BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common inherited cause for 
premature coronary artery disease that increases suffering and disability in 
affected people. However, the extent to which FH impacts work productivity at a 
population level is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the burden of heterozygous FH (HeFH) in terms of 
productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) lost to HeFH in Australia.
METHODS: A life-table model was constructed to quantify years of life and PALYs 
lived by Australians with HeFH (prevalence 1 in 300) and of working age (aged 
20-69 years). Follow-up was simulated until age 70 years. The model was then 
resimulated, but assuming the cohort did not have HeFH. Increased cardiovascular 
mortality and reduction in productivity attributable to HeFH were sourced from 
published data. Differences in total years of life, quality-adjusted life years, 
and PALYs lived by the "HeFH cohort" and the same cohort without HeFH ("non-HeFH 
cohort") reflected the quality-adjusted life years and PALYs lost due to HeFH. 
All future costs and outcomes were discounted by 5% annually.
RESULTS: In 2017, an estimated 51,587 people of working age in Australia (0.33%) 
had HeFH. Over their working lifetime, we predicted that 2950 excess 
cardiovascular deaths occurred in the current Australian population of working 
age individuals with HeFH, resulting in a loss of 24,727 years of life. In terms 
of productivity, HeFH led to the loss of 24,954 PALYs over the working lifetime. 
Based on gross domestic product (GDP) per full-time equivalent worker, this 
equated to a total of AUD 5.23 billion in lost GDP over the working lifetime, 
with an average of AUD 101,366 lost per person. A relative reduction of 20% in 
cardiovascular deaths (as can be achieved with adequate cholesterol control) 
would lead to 1113 PALYs and AUD 233 million in GDP saved in the HeFH cohort.
CONCLUSION: The impact of HeFH on work productivity is significant. Screening 
and prevention strategies tailored early in life are likely to exert not only a 
positive impact on health but also the economy.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of impaired coronary 
access and coronary obstruction after redo TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Post-procedure multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) 
scans of 221 TAVI recipients were analysed. Increased risk of impaired coronary 
access was defined as a coronary ostium below the TAVI commissures with a 
valve-to-aorta distance <2 mm at this level. Increased risk was found in 123 
(55.6%) cases: the left main was involved in 109 (49.3%), the right coronary in 
79 (35.7%), and both were involved in 65 (29.4%) patients. A small sinotubular 
junction (STJ width OR 0.68, CI: 0.56-0.81, p<0.001; STJ height OR 0.81, CI: 
0.69-0.95, p<0.011) and supra-annular devices (OR 19.8, CI: 6.6-58.8, p<0.001) 
predicted increased risk. Increased risk of coronary obstruction, defined as a 
coronary ostium below the TAVI commissures with a valve-to-coronary distance <2 
mm, was observed in 14.9% of patients; in 17.2% of cases complete sealing of the 
STJ would occur.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-TAVI MDCT suggested an increased potential risk of impaired 
coronary access in more than half of the patients should redo TAVI be required, 
predicted by a small STJ and supra-annular device design. Furthermore, 10-20% of 
patients presented an increased risk of coronary obstruction. While this 
theoretical study is hypothesis-generating, it raises concerns that need to be 
further investigated and addressed before TAVI is extended to patients with 
longer life expectancy.

Vesicle and target membrane fusion involves tethering, docking and fusion. The 
GTPase SECRETORY4 (SEC4) positions the exocyst complex during vesicle membrane 
tethering, facilitating docking and fusion. Glycine max (soybean) Sec4 functions 
in the root during its defense against the parasitic nematode Heterodera 
glycines as it attempts to develop a multinucleate nurse cell (syncytium) 
serving to nourish the nematode over its 30-day life cycle. Results indicate 
that other tethering proteins are also important for defense. The G. max exocyst 
is encoded by 61 genes: 5 EXOC1 (Sec3), 2 EXOC2 (Sec5), 5 EXOC3 (Sec6), 2 EXOC4 
(Sec8), 2 EXOC5 (Sec10) 6 EXOC6 (Sec15), 31 EXOC7 (Exo70) and 8 EXOC8 (Exo84) 
genes. At least one member of each gene family is expressed within the syncytium 
during the defense response. Syncytium-expressed exocyst genes function in 
defense while some are under transcriptional regulation by mitogen-activated 
protein kinases (MAPKs). The exocyst component EXOC7-H4-1 is not expressed 
within the syncytium but functions in defense and is under MAPK regulation. The 
tethering stage of vesicle transport has been demonstrated to play an important 
role in defense in the G. max-H. glycines pathosystem, with some of the 
spatially and temporally regulated exocyst components under transcriptional 
control by MAPKs.

BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis have a heavy 
financial burden. The cost-effectiveness of introducing tofacitinib to the 
current treatment sequence for patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid 
arthritis who have inadequate response or intolerance to conventional synthetic 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs-IR) in China remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
introducing tofacitinib into the current treatment sequence in China for 
patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis who have csDMARDs-IR.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed from the perspective of the Chinese 
healthcare system to compare treatment sequences with and without first-line 
tofacitinib for patients with rheumatoid arthritis with csDMARDs-IR. The 
treatment sequence without tofacitinib included adalimumab, etanercept, 
recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor-Fc fusion protein, infliximab, 
and tocilizumab. Costs were derived from publicly available sources. Clinical 
trials, network meta-analysis, and real-world data were used to generate 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), transition probabilities, and the incidence 
of adverse events. Mortality probabilities were estimated from rheumatoid 
arthritis-based, Chinese all-cause mortality data. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to verify the robustness of the model. In 
addition, the cost-effectiveness of adding tofacitinib as second- and third-line 
treatment options was evaluated in our analyses. Costs and effects were 
discounted at 5% per anum.
RESULTS: Compared to the current treatment sequence, adding tofacitinib as 
first-line treatment led to a cost-saving of $US880.11 (2018 values) and 
incremental QALYs of 1.34. Sensitivity analyses showed the results to be robust. 
Adding tofacitinib at second-line therapy was also a cost-saving option with a 
cost saving of $US653.65 and incremental QALYs of 1.34, while the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of adding tofacitinib at third-line therapy was 
$US5588.14 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the WHO-recommended ICER acceptability threshold of ≤ 1-time 
per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), our analysis suggests that the 
introduction of tofacitinib into the current treatment sequence for 
moderate-to-severe RA patients with csDMARDs-IR in China was a cost saving 
option as first- and second-line treatment, and cost-effective as a third-line 
treatment option. Of note, use of tofacitinib as first- and second-line 
treatment post-csDMARDs-IR appeared to be cost saving.

While it has long been known that species have contrasted life expectancy (pace 
of mortality) and generation time (pace of reproduction), recent studies have 
also uncovered that the shape of adult age trajectories of mortality and 
reproduction can vary remarkably among species along a continuum of senescence 
ranging from strong deterioration (senescence), insignificant deterioration 
(negligible senescence) to improvement with advancing age (negative senescence). 
As for many long-lived ectotherms with asymptotic growth and increasing 
reproductive output with age, snakes are good candidates for negligible 
senescence to occur. Yet, intraspecific variation in the pace and shape of 
actuarial and reproductive senescence across wild populations of these species 
remains to be explored. Here, we used 37 years of mark-recapture data in two 
nearby habitats inside a meadow viper Vipera ursinii population to quantify life 
expectancies, generation times and the shape of actuarial and reproductive 
senescence. Female vipers maintained stable reproductive performances at old 
ages, even when accounting for the predicted increase of fertility with body 
size, providing evidence for negligible reproductive senescence in both 
habitats. Males had a higher adult mortality and a shorter life expectancy on 
average than females and actuarial senescence shifted from negligible senescence 
in the optimal habitat to strong senescence in the sub-optimal habitat. Overall, 
these results demonstrate that micro-geographic environmental variation can 
generate qualitative shifts in actuarial senescence patterns. This highlights 
that taking into account the within-species plasticity of age-dependent 
trajectories could prove useful in better understanding what determines the 
evolution of life-history age trajectories.

Publisher: La longévité et la manière de vieillir varient grandement entre 
espèces. Chez certaines espèces, la survie et la reproduction déclinent avec 
l’âge : les individus souffrent de sénescence. Chez d’autres, les vieux 
individus maintiennent des performances reproductives et de survie similaires à 
celles des jeunes : la sénescence est alors dite négligeable. Enfin, la 
sénescence peut être négative quand la survie des adultes ou leur reproduction 
s’améliorent avec l’âge. Les formes des trajectoires de mortalité et de 
reproduction avec l’âge sont encore mal connues chez les serpents, mais la 
théorie évolutive prédit une sénescence négligeable chez les espèces qui, comme 
les serpents, continuent à grandir à l’âge adulte et dont les femelles 
produisent des portées dont l’effectif augmente avec la taille corporelle de la 
mère. Nous avons exploité ici 37 années de données de capture-marquage-recapture 
de vipères d’Orsini, Vipera ursinii ursinii, dans deux habitats voisins d’une 
petite population isolée du Sud-Est de la France pour quantifier l'espérance de 
vie, les temps de génération et les formes de la sénescence de survie et de la 
sénescence reproductrice. Nous montrons que les vipères femelles parviennent à 
maintenir de bonnes performances reproductives même à des âges avancés, 
illustrant une sénescence reproductrice négligeable dans cette population. Nous 
montrons aussi que la forme de la sénescence de survie varie fortement à une 
très petite échelle géographique : dans l'habitat optimal, la survie adulte des 
vipères demeure stable quel que soit leur âge alors qu’à quelques centaines de 
mètres, dans un habitat moins favorable, les vipères subissent une forte 
sénescence de survie. Ces résultats démontrent que de forts changements 
qualitatifs dans les profils de sénescence peuvent être observés à une échelle 
spatiale réduite. Cette plasticité intra-spécifique de la sénescence offre de 
nouvelles perspectives pour mieux comprendre ce qui détermine l'évolution de la 
sénescence.

Autoantibodies are key biomarkers in clinical diagnosis of autoimmune diseases 
routinely detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). However, the 
complexity of these assays is limiting their use in routine diagnostics. Fiber 
optic-surface plasmon resonance (FO-SPR) can overcome these limitations, but 
improved surface chemistries are still needed to guarantee detection of 
autoantibodies in complex matrices. In this paper, we describe the development 
of an FO-SPR immunoassay for the detection of autoantibodies in plasma samples 
from immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) patients. 
Hereto, hexahistidine-tagged recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13-His6) was 
immobilized on nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-coated FO probes chelated by cobalt 
(Co(III)) and exposed to anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. Initial studies were 
performed to optimize rADAMTS13-His6 immobilization and to confirm the 
specificity of the immunoassay for detection of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies 
with FO-SPR. The performance of the immunoassay was then evaluated by comparing 
Co(III)- and nickel (Ni(II))-NTA stabilized surfaces, confirming the stable 
immobilization of the antigen in Co(III)-NTA-functionalized FO probes. A 
calibration curve was prepared with a dilution series of a cloned human 
anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibody in ADAMTS13-depleted plasma resulting in an average 
interassay coefficient of variation of 7.1% and a limit of detection of 0.24 
ng/mL. Finally, the FO-SPR immunoassay was validated using seven iTTP patient 
plasma samples, resulting in an excellent correlation with an in-house-developed 
ELISA (r = 0.973). In summary, the specificity and high sensitivity in 
combination with a short time-to-result (2.5 h compared to 4-5 h for a regular 
ELISA) make the FO-SPR immunoassay a powerful assay for routine diagnosis of 
iTTP and with extension for any other autoimmune disease.

Advancements in medical science have facilitated in extending human lives. The 
increased life expectancy, though, has come at a cost. The cases of an aging 
population suffering from degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
are presently at its all-time high. Amyloidosis disorders such as AD are 
triggered by an abnormal transition of soluble proteins into their highly 
ordered aggregated forms. The landscape of amyloidosis treatment remains 
unchanged, and there is no cure for such disorders. However, an increased 
understanding of the mechanism of amyloid self-assembly has given hope for a 
possible therapeutic solution. In this review, we will discuss the current state 
of molecular and non-molecular options for therapeutic intervention of 
amyloidosis. We highlight the efficacy of non-invasive physical therapies as 
possible alternatives to their molecular counterparts. Graphical abstract.

PURPOSE: To evaluate secondary outcomes including changes in functioning and 
disability associated with galcanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to 
calcitonin gene-related peptide, in patients with chronic migraine.
METHODS: Patients randomly received galcanezumab (120 mg n = 278, 240 mg 
n = 277) or placebo (n = 558) during 3 months of double-blind treatment, 
followed by a 9-month open-label extension. The Migraine-Specific 
Quality-of-Life Questionnaire v2.1 (MSQv2.1) measured the impact of migraine on 
patient functioning. The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) quantified 
headache-related disability. Changes from baseline were analyzed with mixed 
model repeated measures or analysis of covariance.
RESULTS: Total MSQ score at baseline was 44.88 ± 18.02 (mean ± SD), indicating 
significant functional impairment. At Month 3, least squares (LS) mean 
change ± SE in total MSQ for galcanezumab-treated patients were 20.51 ± 1.49 
(120 mg) and 20.49 ± 1.49 (240 mg), both statistically significantly greater vs 
placebo-treated patients (14.55 ± 1.21; both P < 0.001). Total MIDAS score at 
baseline was 67.24 ± 57.31 (mean ± SD). At Month 3, LS mean change ± SE from 
baseline in total MIDAS for galcanezumab-treated patients was statistically 
significantly greater than placebo for 120 mg group (placebo: - 11.53 ± 3.38 vs 
120 mg: - 20.27 ± 4.07; P < 0.05) but not for 240 mg group (- 17.02 ± 4.05). At 
Month 12, within-group mean changes from baseline for total MSQ (28.56 ± 1.19 
previous placebo; 29.53 ± 1.51 previous 120 mg; 25.83 ± 1.49 previous 240 mg) 
and MIDAS scores (- 28.47 ± 2.95 previous placebo; - 31.47 ± 3.69 previous 
120 mg; - 31.13 ± 3.62 previous 240 mg) were statistically significant 
(P < 0.001) for the open-label treatment population regardless of previous 
double-blind treatment assignment.
CONCLUSIONS: Galcanezumab-treated patients with chronic migraine reported 
statistically significant improvements in functioning and disability, 
representing a clinically significant change.

The nature and prevalence of combinations of mental disorders and their 
associations with premature mortality have never been reported in a 
comprehensive way. We describe the most common combinations of mental disorders 
and estimate excess mortality associated with these combinations. We designed a 
population-based cohort study including all 7,505,576 persons living in Denmark 
at some point between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2016. Information on 
mental disorders and mortality was obtained from national registers. A total of 
546,090 individuals (10.5%) living in Denmark on January 1, 1995 were diagnosed 
with at least one mental disorder during the 22-year follow-up period. The 
overall crude rate of diagnosis of mental disorders was 9.28 (95% CI: 9.26-9.30) 
per 1,000 person-years. The rate of diagnosis of additional mental disorders was 
70.01 (95% CI: 69.80-70.26) per 1,000 person-years for individuals with one 
disorder already diagnosed. At the end of follow-up, two out of five individuals 
with mental disorders were diagnosed with two or more disorder types. The most 
prevalent were neurotic/stress-related/somatoform disorders (ICD-10 F40-F48) and 
mood disorders (ICD-10 F30-F39), which - alone or in combination with other 
disorders - were present in 64.8% of individuals diagnosed with any mental 
disorder. Mortality rates were higher for people with mental disorders compared 
to those without mental disorders. The highest mortality rate ratio was 5.97 
(95% CI: 5.52-6.45) for the combination of schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20-F29), 
neurotic/stress-related/somatoform disorders and substance use disorders (ICD-10 
F10-F19). Any combination of mental disorders was associated with a shorter life 
expectancy compared to the general Danish population, with differences in 
remaining life expectancy ranging from 5.06 years (95% CI: 5.01-5.11) to 17.46 
years (95% CI: 16.86-18.03). The largest excess mortality was observed for 
combinations that included substance use disorders. This study reports novel 
estimates related to the "force of comorbidity" and provides new insights into 
the contribution of substance use disorders to premature mortality in those with 
comorbid mental disorders.

In September of 2018, onion plants (Allium cepa cv. Joaquin) grown in one field 
in southwest Idaho were observed to have roots with brown discoloration over 
10-20% of the total root surface area. Approximately 10% of plants over a 1 ha 
area were affected and these plants were about visually 50% smaller than the 
typical bulb size present in the field. To determine the causal agent, 3 mm 
pieces of symptomatic roots from four plants were placed in sodium hypochlorite 
(2%) for one minute, followed by two rinses in sterile water and plated on to 
water agar medium amended with penicillin G (0.2 g/liter) and streptomycin 
sulfate (0.8 g/liter). After 3 days at 21°C, fungal colonies with septate hyphae 
with right-angled branching resembling Rhizoctonia solani were observed in over 
half of the 16 isolations attempted. Species identity was confirmed through rDNA 
ITS sequencing, as described previously (Woodhall et al., 2013), with DNA 
obtained from a single representative hyphal tip culture grown on Potato 
Dextrose Agar (PDA) which was designated isolate ON3. The resulting sequence 
(MT672318), was 100% identical (678/678bp) to a sequence previously identified 
as R. solani AG 2-2 IIIB on GenBank (FJ492137). Pathogenicity of the culture was 
determined by inoculating ten 20-day-old plants (cv. Joaquin) grown in premium 
potting compost (Scotts) with a single, fully colonized 10 mm2 plug taken from a 
2-week-old PDA culture of isolate ON3. A further nine plants were inoculated 
with sterile PDA plugs as controls. Plants were grown in the greenhouse at 21C 
in a 16-hour light regime. After 24 days, each plant was assessed for root rot 
disease as described previously (Misawa et al. 2017). Root rot was observed on 
nine of the inoculated plants. Mean diseased root area was 32% of the total root 
surface, with a minimum of 5% and a maximum of 100% diseased root area and a 
standard deviation equal to 39.6. No root browning was observed on any of the 
control plants. Isolations were attempted from nine symptomatic plants and R. 
solani was successfully isolated from seven plant samples onto water agar. 
Sequencing was used to confirm identity as AG2-2IIIB. To our knowledge, this is 
the first report of R. solani AG 2-2 IIIB affecting onions in Idaho. Previous 
work in the Pacific Northwest recovered R. solani AG2-1, 3, 4 and 8 and also BNR 
AG A from stunted onions (Patzek et al., 2013). In Japan, Misawa et al. (2017) 
found AG 2-2 IIIB to be pathogenic to Welsh onion (Allium fistulosum). In Idaho, 
R. solani AG 2-2 IIIB has was previously reported causing disease in sugar beets 
(Strausbaugh et al. 2011) and potatoes (Woodhall et al. 2012). Growers should 
consider crop rotation strategies or soil treatments if R. solani AG2-2IIIB is 
causing disease in their crops.

BACKGROUND: Clinical response in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is most commonly 
assessed using the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) measure. 
Dermal tunnels, increased body mass index, smoking and antibiotic use 
significantly decrease the odds of achieving HiSCR. However, there are few data 
exploring if clinical features are also associated with length of time to 
achieve clinical response and/or time to lose clinical response.
AIM: To explore whether variables associated with achievement of HiSCR are 
associated with time to achieve HiSCR and time to loss of HiSCR in patients with 
HS treated with adalimumab 40 mg weekly in the PIONEER open-label extension 
study.
METHODS: Time-to-event analyses were performed to estimate time to achieve HiSCR 
and time to loss of HiSCR. The log rank test was used to compare cumulative 
incidence curves for a priori patient- and disease-associated factors. Cox 
regression analysis was performed to compare time-to-event outcomes in the 
presence of a priori variables. All statistical analyses were completed with R 
software (V3.5.3).
RESULTS: Presence of dermal tunnels significantly increased the time to achieve 
HiSCR (median 32.6 vs. 14.3 weeks, P = 0.02) and the hazard ratio (HR) was 
significant after controlling for patient and disease factors (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 
0.51-0.96, P = 0.03). A positive family history of HS significantly decreased 
the time to loss of HiSCR (median 11.4 vs. 18 weeks, P < 0.001) and remained 
significant in Cox regression analysis (HR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.40-2.88, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The presence of dermal tunnels significantly influences the odds of 
achieving HiSCR and the time to achieve HiSCR, while family history influences 
time to loss of HiSCR.
