INTRODUCTION: The incidence of kidney cancer is increasing; it could be 
counteracted with new ways to predict and detect it. We aimed to implement an 
artificial neural network in order to predict new cases of renal-cell carcinoma 
(RCC) in the population using population rate, obesity, smoking incidence, 
uncontrolled hypertension, and life expectancy data in the United States.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Statistics were collected on US population numbers, life 
expectancy, obesity, smoking, and hypertension. We used MATLAB R2018 (MathWorks) 
software to implement an artificial neural network. Data were repeatedly and 
randomly divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) subsets.
RESULTS: The number of new RCC cases will grow from 44,400 (2020) to 55,400 
(2050), an increase of +24.7%. Our data show that preventing hypertension would 
have the greatest impact on reduction of the incidence, estimated at -775 
and -575 cases per year in 2020 and in 2030, respectively. The prevention of 
obesity and smoking would have a more limited impact, estimated at -64 and -180 
cases per year in 2020 and in 2030, respectively, for obesity, and -173 and -21 
cases per year in 2020 and in 2030, respectively, for smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: Our predictions underline the need for accurate studies on 
RCC-related risk factors to reduce the incidence.

PURPOSE: Mesothelin (MSLN) is a glycophosphatidylinositol-linked tumor antigen 
overexpressed in a variety of malignancies, including ovarian, pancreatic, lung, 
and triple-negative breast cancer. Early signs of clinical efficacy with 
MSLN-targeting agents have validated MSLN as a promising target for therapeutic 
intervention, but therapies with improved efficacy are still needed to address 
the significant unmet medical need posed by MSLN-expressing cancers.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We designed HPN536, a 53-kDa, trispecific, 
T-cell-activating protein-based construct, which binds to MSLN-expressing tumor 
cells, CD3ε on T cells, and to serum albumin. Experiments were conducted to 
assess the potency, activity, and half-life of HPN536 in in vitro assays, rodent 
models, and in nonhuman primates (NHP).
RESULTS: HPN536 binds to MSLN-expressing tumor cells and to CD3ε on T cells, 
leading to T-cell activation and potent redirected target cell lysis. A third 
domain of HPN536 binds to serum albumin for extension of plasma half-life. In 
cynomolgus monkeys, HPN536 at doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg demonstrated 
MSLN-dependent pharmacologic activity, was well tolerated, and showed 
pharmacokinetics in support of weekly dosing in humans.
CONCLUSIONS: HPN536 is potent, is well tolerated, and exhibits extended 
half-life in NHPs. It is currently in phase I clinical testing in patients with 
MSLN-expressing malignancies (NCT03872206).

Cold Atmospheric pressure Plasma (CAP) is a non-thermal method used in food 
processing. CAP generated with the use of nitrogen in a Glide-arc device for 300 
to 600 s exhibited high potential for microbial decontamination and did not 
induce substantial changes in the physicochemical properties of NFC tomato 
juice. Samples exposed to cold atmospheric plasma had mostly an intact 
structure, as revealed by digital microscopy. The investigations indicate that 
CAP can be applied for biological and chemical waste-free decontamination of 
food and extension of its shelf life.

Aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid tumor is a rare disease resulting from 
fibroblasts which do not metastasize. However, desmoid tumors belong to 
low-grade malignant tumors since they have high potential to infiltrate 
surrounding tissues, causing high local recurrence rates and may affect 
surrounding organs, threatening life quality and expectancy. Although surgery, 
watch and wait, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, high intensity focused ultrasound, 
ablation techniques or several agents have all been frequently investigated for 
the treatment of this type of disease, none are deemed as standard therapy for 
high recurrence rates that have been supported by any data. The present review 
retrieved literature on treatment options for desmoids to summarize the latest 
treatment modalities and refine their efficacy, as well as their side effects, 
in order to provide a more comprehensive treatment reference for clinicians.

Psoriasis is a long-lasting, noncontagious chronic inflammatory disease of skin 
and joints. Previous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that psoriatic 
patients have a shorter life expectancy, mainly due to cardiovascular (CV) 
events with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors like 
dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, obesity, and hypertension. 
Besides these risk factors, psoriasis likely plays an independent role in 
increasing CV events probably due to the chronic inflammatory state. This 
literature review aims to summarize the mechanism of atherosclerosis formation, 
CV risk factors, tools to diagnose subclinical atherosclerosis, and the effects 
of various therapies in psoriatic patients to prevent cardiovascular-related 
deaths in psoriasis. This review was performed by searching the relevant 
articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases without including any exclusion 
criteria and time limitations. Our review documented that psoriatic patients are 
at increased risk of CV events due to chronic inflammatory profile and the 
associated CV risk factors. Also, anti-inflammatory therapies may prevent early 
subclinical atherosclerotic vascular changes reducing cardiovascular events. 
However, the available studies lack to establish the exact targets for CV risk 
factors, to assess the clinical importance of screening for subclinical vascular 
changes and the impact of anti-inflammatory therapies on CV risk profile in 
psoriatic patients. This heightened awareness about the CV involvement in 
psoriasis should encourage conducting large, well planned comprehensive studies 
to address these issues that can reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

BACKGROUND: We present study designs, dose selection and preliminary patient 
characteristics from two phase 3 clinical trials of gefapixant, a P2X3 receptor 
antagonist, in refractory chronic cough (RCC) or unexplained chronic cough 
(UCC).
METHODS: COUGH-1 (NCT03449134) and COUGH-2 (NCT03449147) are randomised, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trials in subjects with RCC or 
UCC (age ≥18 years; cough duration ≥1 year; Cough Severity Visual Analogue Scale 
score ≥40 mm). The primary efficacy study periods are 12 weeks (40-week 
extension; COUGH-1) and 24 weeks (28-week extension; COUGH-2). Interventions 
include placebo, gefapixant 15 mg and gefapixant 45 mg (1:1:1 ratio). The 
primary efficacy endpoints are average 24-h cough frequency at Week 12 (COUGH-1) 
and Week 24 (COUGH-2). Awake cough frequency, patient-reported outcomes and 
responder analyses are secondary endpoints.
RESULTS: The doses of 45 mg (to provide maximal efficacy and acceptable 
tolerability) and 15 mg (to provide acceptable efficacy and improved 
tolerability) were selected based on phase 1 and 2 studies. In COUGH-1, 730 
participants have been randomised and treated; 74% are female with mean age of 
59 years (39% over 65 years), and mean baseline duration of cough of 11.5 years. 
In COUGH-2, 1314 participants have been randomised and treated; 75% are female 
with mean age of 58 years (33% over 65 years), and mean baseline duration of 
cough of 11.1 years.
CONCLUSIONS: These global studies include participants with baseline 
characteristics consistent with previous RCC and UCC studies and will inform the 
efficacy and safety profile of gefapixant in the treatment of patients with RCC 
and UCC.

OBJECTIVE: Hypertension can cause significant morbidity and reduced life 
expectancy. Most patients with hypertension have primary hypertension; however, 
10% to 15% have secondary hypertension. Endocrine disorders as a secondary cause 
occur in approximately 10% of patients with secondary hypertension, and thyroid 
disorders account for approximately 1% of all patients with hypertension. The 
identification of patients with hyperthyroidism has important benefits for these 
particular patients. The objective of this study was to examine the occurrence 
of high blood pressure in patients with hyperthyroidism.
METHODS: We reviewed the clinical information available from 414 new patients 
referred to an endocrinology clinic in west Texas for evaluation of 
hyperthyroidism. The final cohort included 96 patients who had both thyroid 
laboratory tests and blood pressure measurements at the time of their clinic 
visit. We also examined this relationship in a nationally representative sample 
of US adults (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2012), which 
included thyroid test results and at least one blood pressure measurement (N = 
8837).
RESULTS: Sixty-five of these clinic patients had elevated blood pressure based 
on criteria suggested by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association. These patients had similar thyroid hormone levels as patients who 
did not have hypertension but tended to be older. Ordinary least squares 
regression analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
2007-2012 data demonstrated a significant positive association between free T3 
levels and systolic blood pressure, adjusting for age, sex, and the use of 
levothyroxine.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings from a specialty clinic and a national sample 
suggest that clinicians should consider the possibility of hyperthyroidism in 
patients with hypertension, even in older patients.

Benzophenone synthase (BPS) catalyzes the production of 
2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone via the condensation of benzoyl-CoA and three units 
of malonyl-CoA. The biosynthetic pathway proceeds with the formation of the 
prenylated xanthone α-mangostin from 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone. Structural 
elucidation was performed to gain a better understanding of the structural basis 
of the function of Garcinia mangostana L. (mangosteen) BPS (GmBPS). The 
structure reveals the common core consisting of a five-layer αβαβα fold as found 
in other type III polyketide synthase enzymes. The three residues Met264, Tyr266 
and Gly339 are proposed to have a significant impact on the substrate-binding 
specificity of the active site. Crystallographic and docking studies indicate 
why benzoyl-CoA is preferred over 4-coumaroyl-CoA as the substrate for GmBPS. 
Met264 and Tyr266 in GmBPS are properly oriented for accommodation of the 
2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone product but not of naringenin. Gly339 offers a 
minimal steric hindrance to accommodate the extended substrate. Moreover, the 
structural arrangement of Thr133 provides the elongation activity and 
consequently facilitates extension of the polyketide chain. In addition to its 
impact on the substrate selectivity, Ala257 expands the horizontal cavity and 
might serve to facilitate the initiation/cyclization reaction. The detailed 
structure of GmBPS explains its catalytic function, facilitating further 
structure-based engineering to alter its substrate specificity and obtain the 
desired products.

OBJECTIVE: Population ageing is a global phenomenon, and life expectancy in 
Brazil is growing fast. Epilepsy is the third most important chronic 
neurological disorder, and its incidence is higher among elderly patients than 
in any other segment of the population. The prevalence of epilepsy is greater 
among inpatients than in the general population and it is related to long length 
of hospital stay (LOS), which is associated with hospital mortality and higher 
healthcare costs. Despite these facts, reports of elderly inpatients admitted 
with seizures and associated outcomes are scarce. To identify predictors of long 
LOS among elderly inpatients admitted with seizures.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled elders admitted with epileptic seizures or 
who experienced seizures throughout hospitalization between November 2015 and 
August 2019. We analysed demographic data, neurological disorders, clinical 
comorbidities, and seizure features to identify risk factors.
RESULTS: The median LOS was 11 days, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 5-21 
days. The frequency of long LOS (defined as a period of hospitalization ≥12 
days) was 47%. Multivariate analysis showed there was an exponential increase in 
long LOS if a patient showed any of the following conditions: intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission (OR=4.562), urinary tract infection (OR=3.402), movement 
disorder (OR=5.656), early seizure recurrence (OR=2.090), and sepsis (OR=4.014).
CONCLUSION: Long LOS was common among elderly patients admitted with seizures, 
and most predictors of long LOS found in this cohort might be avoidable; these 
findings should be confirmed with further research.

INTRODUCTION: On the basis of reductions in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) 
progression and major adverse cardiovascular events observed in the landmark 
CREDENCE trial, canagliflozin 100 mg received an extension to its EU marketing 
authorisation in July 2020 to include the treatment of DKD in people with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) making it the first pharmacological therapy to receive 
regulatory authorisation for treatment of DKD since the RENAAL and IDNT trials 
in nearly 20 years. Efficient allocation of limited healthcare resources 
requires evaluation not only of clinical safety and efficacy but also economic 
consequences. The study aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
canagliflozin when added to current standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone from 
the perspective of the NHS in England.
METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed using patient-level data from 
CREDENCE, including risk equations for the key clinical outcomes of start of 
dialysis, hospitalisation for heart failure, nonfatal myocardial infarction, 
nonfatal stroke, and all-cause mortality. DKD progression was modelled using 
estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 
evolution equations. Risk for kidney transplant was sourced from UK-specific 
sources given the near absence of events in CREDENCE. Patient characteristics 
and treatment effects were sourced from CREDENCE. Unit costs (£2019) and 
disutility weights were sourced from the literature and discounted at 3.5% 
annually. The time horizon was 10 years in the base case, and sensitivity 
analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Canagliflozin was associated with sizable gains in life-years and 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALYs) over 10 years, with gains increasing with 
simulation duration. Cost offsets associated with reductions in cardiovascular 
and renal complications were sufficient to achieve overall net cost savings. The 
findings were generally confirmed in the sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Model results suggest that adding canagliflozin 100 mg to SoC can 
improve patient outcomes while reducing overall net costs from the NHS 
perspective in England.

Different bioinformatic methods apply various approaches to predict how much the 
effect of a SNP could be deleterious and therefore their results may differ 
significantly. However, variation studies often need to consider an integrated 
prediction result to analyze the effect of SNPs. To address this problem, we 
used an algorithm to map ordinal predictions to a numeral space and averaging 
them, and based on it we developed the ISNPranker web-tool 
(http://isnpranker.semilab.ir/). It takes heterogonous outputs of different 
predictors and generates integrated numerical predictions and ranks SNPs based 
on them. Afterward, we used ISNPranker to identify the most deleterious coding 
SNPs (cSNPs) of the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene. AHR is a 
ligand-activated transcription factor that governs many molecular and cellular 
mechanisms and cSNPs may affect its structure, interactions, and function. Forty 
validated cSNPs of AHR were initially analyzed using 16 publicly available SNP 
analyzers and the results were introduced to the ISNPranker and integrated 
predictions were obtained. The cSNPs were ranked in 34 levels of danger and 
rs200257782 in the ARNT dimerization domain (ADD121-289) of AHR was identified 
as the most deleterious cSNP. The rs148360742, which affect ADD40-79 and Hsp90 
binding domain (HBD27-79) was in the second rank and the third and fourth ranks 
were occupied by ADD121-289-located variations rs571123681 and rs141667112 
respectively. In conclusion, we introduced ISNPranker, which is a web-tool for 
integrative ranking of SNPs, and we showed that AHR structure and function may 
be highly sensitive to the cSNPs in the ARNT dimerization domain.

The purpose of this study was to compare sociodemographic factors, health 
factors and nutritional status according to the physical activity of older 
women, and to analyze the factors affecting their quality of life. The subjects 
of this study were 5661 older women aged 60 or older who participated in the 
Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey (KNHANES) from 2008 to 2013. The 
socioeconomic factors, subjective health status and disease status, lifestyle 
and dietary quality, and life quality were compared among two groups (active 
group and inactive group). The inactive group had significantly higher rates of 
obesity and unemployment, comorbidities, numbers without spouses, experiencing 
stress, poor subjective health status, depression or suicidal thoughts, and also 
higher rates of skipping meals. The life quality index and dietary quality was 
also significantly lower in the inactive group, and subjects experienced 
significantly higher pain or discomfort and problems in mobility and the usual 
activities. The results of multivariate analysis after adjusting for age in 
groups engaging in physical activities showed the life quality index to increase 
in accordance with the diet quality, economic income, and education level. It 
was confirmed that life quality was significantly low if the participant showed 
a poor subjective health evaluation, obese with many diseases, spouseless, and 
experienced high levels of stress. Considering the rapid aging and high life 
expectancy of women, regular physical activity is very important for maintaining 
health and improving the life quality of older women, and it is believed that 
comprehensive attention and management of lifestyle and diet quality are 
necessary.

Development and growth are complex and tumultuous processes. Modern economic 
growth theories identify some key determinants of economic growth. However, the 
relative importance of the determinants remains unknown, and additional 
variables may help clarify the directions and dimensions of the interactions. 
The novel stream of literature on economic complexity goes beyond aggregate 
measures of productive inputs and considers instead a more granular and 
structural view of the productive possibilities of countries, i.e., their 
capabilities. Different endowments of capabilities are crucial ingredients in 
explaining differences in economic performances. In this paper we employ 
economic fitness, a measure of productive capabilities obtained through complex 
network techniques. Focusing on the combined roles of fitness and some more 
traditional drivers of growth-GDP per capita, capital intensity, employment 
ratio, life expectancy, human capital and total factor productivity-we build a 
bridge between economic growth theories and the economic complexity literature. 
Our findings show that fitness plays a crucial role in fostering economic growth 
and, when it is included in the analysis, can be either complementary to 
traditional drivers of growth or can completely overshadow them. Notably, for 
the most complex countries, which have the most diversified export baskets and 
the largest endowments of capabilities, fitness is complementary to the chosen 
growth determinants in enhancing economic growth. The empirical findings are in 
agreement with neoclassical and endogenous growth theories. By contrast, for 
countries with intermediate and low capability levels, fitness emerges as the 
key growth driver. This suggests that economic models should account for 
capabilities; in fact, describing the technological possibilities of countries 
solely in terms of their production functions may lead to a misinterpretation of 
the roles of factors.

to Real Data.

Shijiazhuang 050024, China.

In this paper, we introduced a new three-parameter probability model called 
Poisson generalized half logistic (PoiGHL). The new model possesses an 
increasing, decreasing, unimodal and bathtub failure rates depending on the 
parameters. The relationship of PoiGHL with the exponentiated Weibull Poisson 
(EWP), Poisson exponentiated Erlang-truncated exponential (PEETE), and Poisson 
generalized Gompertz (PGG) model is discussed. We also characterized the PoiGHL 
sub model, i.e the half logistic Poisson (HLP), based on certain functions of a 
random variable by truncated moments. Several mathematical and statistical 
properties of the PoiGHL are investigated such as moments, mean deviations, 
Bonferroni and Lorenz curves, order statistics, Shannon and Renyi entropy, 
Kullback-Leibler divergence, moments of residual life, and probability weighted 
moments. Estimation of the model parameters was achieved by maximum likelihood 
technique and assessed by simulation studies. The stress-strength analysis was 
discussed in detail based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we derived the 
asymptotic confidence interval of R = P ( X 1 < X 2 ) based on the MLEs, and 
examine by simulation studies. In three applications to real data set PoiGHL 
provided better fit and outperform some other popular distributions. In the 
stress-strength parameter estimation PoiGHL model illustrated as a reliable 
choice in reliability analysis as shown using two real data set.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have surveyed the relationship between the presence 
of ≥ 20 natural teeth and mortality. However, very few have evaluated this 
association over a long-term follow-up of more than ten years within a large 
population in Japan. This study aimed to prospectively confirm the associations 
between mortality and the presence of ≥ 20 natural teeth within a 
community-based population in Japan.
METHODS: A prospective observational study including 2208 participants 
aged ≥ 40 years was conducted in Takahata Town, Japan, between May 2005 and 
December 2016. All participants answered a self-administered questionnaire to 
provide their background characteristics, including their number of teeth. The 
participants were classified into two categories based on their self-reported 
number of teeth (< 20 and ≥ 20 teeth). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional-hazards regression model 
to assess risk factors for all-cause, cancer-, and cardiovascular 
disease-related mortality.
RESULTS: The total follow-up period was 131.4 ± 24.1 months (mean ± SD). After 
adjusting for covariates, the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly 
higher in the group with < 20 teeth than in those with ≥ 20 teeth (HR = 1.604, 
95% CI 1.007-2.555, p = 0.047). However, the risk of cancer- and cardiovascular 
disease-related mortalities was not statistically significant between the two 
groups.
CONCLUSION: In this study, participants with < 20 teeth had a significantly 
higher risk of all-cause mortality, although the difference was borderline 
significant. These results emphasize the importance of having ≥ 20 natural teeth 
for a healthy life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if magnetic resonance-guided 
focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is cost-effective compared with medication, for 
refractory pain from bone metastases in the United States.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov state transition model using TreeAge Pro 
software (TreeAge Software, Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA) to model costs, 
outcomes, and the cost-effectiveness of a treatment strategy using MRgFUS for 
palliative treatment of painful bone metastases compared with a Medication Only 
strategy (Figure 1). Model transition state probabilities, costs (in 2018 US$), 
and effectiveness data (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) were derived from 
available literature, local expert opinion, and reimbursement patterns at two 
U.S. tertiary academic medical centers actively performing MRgFUS. Costs and 
QALYs, discounted at three percent per year, were accumulated each month over a 
24-month time horizon. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the MRgFUS treatment strategy costs an 
additional $11,863 over the 2-year time horizon to accumulate additional 0.22 
QALYs, equal to a $54,160/QALY ICER, thus making MRgFUS the preferred strategy. 
One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrate that for the base-case analysis, the 
crossover point at which Medication Only would instead become the preferred 
strategy is $23,341 per treatment. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
demonstrate that 67 percent of model iterations supported the conclusion of the 
base case.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model demonstrates that MRgFUS is cost-effective compared with 
Medication Only for palliation of painful bone metastases for patients with 
medically refractory metastatic bone pain across a range of sensitivity 
analyses.

OBJECTIVES: Studies indicate that many types of surgical care are cost-effective 
compared with other health interventions in low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs). However, global health investments to support these 
interventions remain limited. This study undertakes a scoping review of research 
on the economic impact of surgical interventions in LMICs to determine the 
methodologies used in measuring economic benefits.
DESIGN: The Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework for scoping reviews and 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension 
for Scoping Reviews checklist were used to review the data systematically. 
Online databases were used to identify papers published between 2005 and 2020, 
from which we selected 19 publications that quantitatively examined the economic 
benefits of surgical interventions in LMICs.
RESULTS: Majority of publications (79%) reported the use of disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) to assess economic impact. In comparison, 21% used other 
measures, such as the value of statistical life or cost-effectiveness ratios, or 
no measure at all. 31% were systematic or retrospective reviews of the 
literature on surgical procedures in LMICs, while 69% either directly assessed 
economic impact in a specific area or evaluated the need for surgical procedures 
in LMICs. All studies reviewed related to the economic impact of surgical 
procedures in LMICs, with most about paediatric surgical procedures or a 
specific surgical specialty.
CONCLUSION: To make informed policy decisions regarding global health 
investments, the economic impact must be accurately measured. Researchers employ 
a range of techniques to quantify the economic benefit of surgeries in LMICs, 
which limits understanding of overall economic value. We conclude that the 
literature would benefit from a careful selection of methods, incorporating age 
and disability weights based on the Global Burden of Disease weights, and 
converting DALYs to dollars using the value of statistical life approach and the 
human capital approach, reporting both estimates.

African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a complex nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus 
(NCLDV) that causes a devastating swine disease and it is urgently needed to 
develop effective anti-ASFV vaccines and drugs. The process of mRNA 5'-end 
capping is a common characteristic in eukaryotes and many viruses, and the cap 
structure is required for mRNA stability and efficient translation. The ASFV 
protein pNP868R was found to have guanylyltransferase (GTase) activity involved 
in mRNA capping. Here we report the crystal structure of pNP868R 
methyltransferase (MTase) domain (referred as pNP868RMT) in complex with 
S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet). The structure shows the characteristic core 
fold of the class I MTase family and the AdoMet is bound in a negative-deep 
groove. Remarkably, the N-terminal extension of pNP868RMT is ordered and keeps 
away from the AdoMet-binding site, distinct from the close conformation over the 
active site of poxvirus RNA capping D1 subunit or the largely disordered 
conformation in most cellular RNA capping MTases. Structure-based mutagenesis 
studies based on the pNP868RMT-cap analog complex model revealed essential 
residues involved in substrate recognition and binding. Functional studies 
suggest the N-terminal extension may play an essential role in substrate 
recognition instead of AdoMet-binding. A positively charged path stretching from 
the N-terminal extension to the region around the active site was suggested to 
provide a favorable electrostatic environment for the binding and approaching of 
substrate RNA into the active site. Our structure and biochemical studies 
provide novel insights into the methyltransfer process of mRNA cap catalyzed by 
pNP868R.IMPORTANCE African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious hemorrhagic 
viral disease in pigs that is caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). There 
are no effective drugs or vaccines for protection against ASFV infection till 
now. The protein pNP868R was predicted to be responsible for process of mRNA 
5'-end capping in ASFV, which is essential for mRNA stability and efficient 
translation. Here, we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of the 
methyltransferase (MTase) domain of pNP868R. The MTase domain structure shows a 
canonical class I MTase family fold and the AdoMet binds into a negative pocket. 
Structure-based mutagenesis studies revealed critical and conserved residues 
involved in AdoMet-binding and substrate RNA-binding. Notably, both the 
conformation and the role in MTase activities of the N-terminal extension are 
distinct from those of previously characterized poxvirus MTase domain. Our 
structure-function studies provide the basis for potential anti-ASFV inhibitor 
design targeting the critical enzyme.

For the first time in history, most of the population has a life expectancy 
equal or greater than 60 years. By the year 2050, it is expected that the world 
population in that age range will reach 2000 million, an increase of 900 million 
with respect to 2015, which poses new challenges for health systems. In this 
way, it is relevant to analyze the most common diseases associated with the 
aging process, namely Alzheimer´s disease, Parkinson Disease and Type II 
Diabetes, some of which may have a common genetic component that can be detected 
before manifesting, in order to delay their progress. Genetic inheritance and 
epigenetics are factors that could be linked in the development of these 
pathologies. Some researchers indicate that the BDNF gene is a common factor of 
these diseases, and apparently some of its polymorphisms favor the progression 
of them. In this regard, alterations in the level of BDNF expression and 
secretion, due to polymorphisms, could be linked to the development and/or 
progression of neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. In this review we will 
deepen on the different polymorphisms in the BDNF gene and their possible 
association with age-related pathologies, to open the possibilities of potential 
therapeutic targets.
