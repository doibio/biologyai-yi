segmentation in a reasonable time, limiting the use of precise quantitative 
measurements in the clinical practice. So, automatic and reliable segmentation 
methods are required; however, the large spatial and structural variability 
among brain tumors make automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In this 
paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method based on Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN), exploring small 3 ×3 kernels. The use of small kernels allows 
designing a deeper architecture, besides having a positive effect against 
overfitting, given the fewer number of weights in the network. We also 
investigated the use of intensity normalization as a pre-processing step, which 
though not common in CNN-based segmentation methods, proved together with data 
augmentation to be very effective for brain tumor segmentation in MRI images. 
Our proposal was validated in the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2013 
database (BRATS 2013), obtaining simultaneously the first position for the 
complete, core, and enhancing regions in Dice Similarity Coefficient metric 
(0.88, 0.83, 0.77) for the Challenge data set. Also, it obtained the overall 
first position by the online evaluation platform. We also participated in the 
on-site BRATS 2015 Challenge using the same model, obtaining the second place, 
with Dice Similarity Coefficient metric of 0.78, 0.65, and 0.75 for the 
complete, core, and enhancing regions, respectively.

Neurogenic bladder refers to dysfunction of the urinary bladder secondary to 
diseases of the nervous system that result in problems with urine storage, 
micturition, or both. The most common causes are multiple sclerosis and spinal 
cord injury. Patients commonly present with recurrent UTIs, obstructive 
uropathies, and urinary retention. Without proper treatment, neurogenic bladder 
may result in nephropathy and renal failure, both of which have a significant 
negative impact on the health and life expectancy of patients. Restoration of 
lost neural function using artificial stimulators is a feasible therapeutic 
strategy. This article reviews the pathophysiology of neurogenic bladder and the 
2 most commonly employed sacral nerve stimulation methods-the Brindley procedure 
and sacral neuromodulation.

Protection against inflammation and oxidative stress is key in slowing down 
aging processes. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) shows flexible aging patterns 
linked to the social role of individual bees. One molecular factor associated 
with honey bee aging regulation is vitellogenin, a lipoglycophosphoprotein with 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recently, we identified three 
genes in Hymenopteran genomes arisen from ancient insect vitellogenin 
duplications, named vg-like-A, -B, and -C. The function of these vitellogenin 
homologs is unclear. We hypothesize that some of them might share gene- and 
protein-level similarities and a longevity-supporting role with vitellogenin. 
Here, we show how the structure and modifications of the vg-like genes and 
proteins have diverged from vitellogenin. Furthermore, all three vg-like genes 
show signs of positive selection, but the spatial location of the selected 
protein sites differ from those found in vitellogenin. We show that all these 
genes are expressed in both long-lived winter worker bees and in summer nurse 
bees with intermediate life expectancy, yet only vg-like-A shows elevated 
expression in winter bees as found in vitellogenin. Finally, we show that 
vg-like-A responds more strongly than vitellogenin to inflammatory and oxidative 
conditions in summer nurse bees, and that also vg-like-B responds to oxidative 
stress. We associate vg-like-A and, to lesser extent, vg-like-B to the antiaging 
roles of vitellogenin, but that vg-like-C probably is involved in some other 
function. Our analysis indicates that an ancient duplication event facilitated 
the adaptive and functional divergence of vitellogenin and its paralogs in the 
honey bee.

BACKGROUND: Even though Insulin glargine (IGlar) has been available and used in 
other countries for more than a decade, it has not been adopted into Thai 
national formulary. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term cost 
effectiveness of IGlar versus neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in type 2 
diabetes from the perspective of Thai Health Care System.
METHODS: A validated computer simulation model (the IMS CORE Diabetes Model) was 
used to estimate the long-term projection of costs and clinical outcomes. The 
model was populated with published characteristics of Thai patients with type 2 
diabetes. Baseline risk factors were obtained from Thai cohort studies, while 
relative risk reduction was derived from a meta-analysis study conducted by the 
Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health. Only direct costs were taken 
into account. Costs of diabetes management and complications were obtained from 
hospital databases in Thailand. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3 % 
per annum and presented in US dollars in terms of 2014 dollar value. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: IGlar is associated with a slight gain in quality-adjusted life years 
(0.488 QALYs), an additional life expectancy (0.677 life years), and an 
incremental cost of THB119,543 (US$3522.19) compared with NPH insulin. The ICERs 
were THB244,915/QALY (US$7216.12/QALY) and THB176,525/life-year gained (LYG) 
(US$5201.09/LYG). The ICER was sensitive to discount rates and IGlar cost. At 
the acceptable willingness to pay of THB160,000/QALY (US$4714.20/QALY), the 
probability that IGlar was cost effective was less than 20 %.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to treatment with NPH insulin, treatment with IGlar in 
type 2 diabetes patients who had uncontrolled blood glucose with oral 
anti-diabetic drugs did not represent good value for money at the acceptable 
threshold in Thailand.

While cardiac secondary prevention in primary care is established practice, 
little is known about its long-term cost effectiveness. This study examines the 
cost effectiveness of a secondary prevention intervention in primary care in the 
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland over 6 years. An economic evaluation, 
based on a cluster randomised controlled trial of 903 patients with heart 
disease, was conducted 4.5 years after the intervention ceased to be delivered. 
Patients originally randomised to the control received usual practice while 
those randomised to the intervention received a tailored care package over the 
1.5-year delivery period. Data on healthcare costs and quality adjusted life 
expectancy were used to undertake incremental cost utility analysis. Multilevel 
regression was used to estimate mean cost effectiveness and uncertainty was 
examined using cost effectiveness acceptability curves. At 6 years, there was a 
divergence in the results across jurisdictions. While the probability of the 
intervention being cost effective in the Republic of Ireland was 0.434, 0.232, 
0.180, 0.150, 0.115 and 0.098 at selected threshold values of €5000, €15,000, 
€20,000, €25,000, €35,000 and €45,000, respectively, all equivalent 
probabilities for Northern Ireland equalled 1.000. Our findings suggest that the 
intervention in its current format is likely to be more cost effective than 
usual general practice care in Northern Ireland, but this is not the case in the 
Republic of Ireland.

The partner in late-life repartnering: caregiving expectations from an 
intergenerational perspective.

Haifa,Haifa,Israel.

BACKGROUND: Late-life repartnering among functionally independent adults, 
resulting in complex stepfamilies, has emerged with increased life expectancy, 
and is likely to develop further. It is perceived as a chance for renewal and 
autonomy, enabling a release from dependency on offspring, whereas caregiving is 
associated with dependency and becoming a burden on family members. Thus, the 
experiences of late-life repartnering and caregiving are opposites. Using a life 
course perspective, we explore partner caregiving expectations in late-life 
repartnering from the viewpoints of three generations in complex stepfamilies in 
Israel, a society characterized by collectivist alongside individualist familial 
norms.
METHODS: Using criterion sampling, we recruited 19 stepfamily units (38 
families) of functionally independent persons who repartnered at the official 
retirement age or older and had offspring from a lifelong marriage that ended in 
widowhood or divorce. One-hundred-seven semi-structured qualitative interviews 
with older partners, their adult children, and grandchildren were audio-recorded 
and transcribed verbatim. Analysis was based on grounded theory principles and 
dyadic analysis adapted to families.
RESULTS: Two themes emerged: caregiving commitment and decision making. Issues 
included: influences of partner-caregiving history; chronic versus temporary 
caregiving situations; caregiving strengthening partner relationships and 
influencing stepfamily relationships, and moral dilemmas, such as what happens 
when fun - a motive for repartnering - is no longer possible. Could abandonment 
become an option?
CONCLUSIONS: From a life course perspective, caregiving, as "on-time," and 
late-life repartnering, as "off-time," highlight the lack of norms and the need 
to establish normative behavior for caregiving in late-life repartnering in 
diverse cultural contexts along with its reservations.

BACKGROUND: With funding for the Competence Networks in Medicine from the 
Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the Competence Network for HIV/AIDS 
(KompNet HIV/AIDS) was established as an interdisciplinary research association. 
Essential working groups were incorporated all over Germany, which are active in 
clinical and basic HIV/AIDS research.
OBJECTIVES: After successful establishment, providing research infrastructure 
for national and international cooperation in the field of HIV/AIDS was the 
focus of the network. By bringing together research activities, preconditions 
are created for improving HIV infection treatment and increasing life expectancy 
of HIV-infected patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The members of KompNet HIV/AIDS are HIV experts from 
university clinics, HIV physicians, patient representatives, as well as national 
reference centers. As a scientific research basis, the network established 
an HIV patient cohort. Clinical and sociodemographic data of HIV patients were 
documented biannually and complemented by serum and DNA-samples collected twice 
per year. Furthermore, a child cohort was set up.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Within the KompNet HIV/AIDS, a research infrastructure 
for HIV was established for internal, external as well international scientists. 
Within the HIV cohort a total of 16,500 patients are documented. The associated 
biobank comprises ~ 56,000 serum samples and ~ 16,000 DNA samples. The child 
cohort consists of 647 HIV-exposed and 230 infected children. The KompNet 
HIV/AIDS cohorts became an important partner in several international 
collaborations. Nevertheless, the maintenance of such infrastructures without 
public funding is a challenge.

The incidences of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related anal cancer and its 
precursor lesion, anal intraepithelial neoplasia, are rising in the U.S. and 
globally. Five-year survival rates with current modalities of treatment for anal 
cancer are generally favorable for localized and regional disease. For 
metastatic disease, the relative survival rate is poor. Major contributing 
factors for the increase in anal cancer incidence include increasing receptive 
anal intercourse (hetero- and homosexual), increasing HPV infections, and longer 
life expectancy of treated people who are seropositive for human 
immunodeficiency virus. Because treatment outcomes with systemic therapy in 
patients with advanced disease are so poor, prevention may be the best approach 
for reducing disease burden. The association of a major causative agent with 
anal cancer provides an excellent opportunity for prevention and treatment. The 
advent of the HPV vaccine for anal cancer prevention and treatment is a 
significant milestone and has the potential to greatly impact these cancers. The 
data regarding potential use of the HPV vaccine in anal cancer prevention and 
treatment are reviewed.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The incidences of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related 
anal cancer and its precursor lesion, anal intraepithelial neoplasia, are on the 
rise in the U.S. and globally. Based on recent studies, the HPV vaccine is 
approved for prevention of the infection and development of HPV-related anal 
cancer. In addition, several small studies have shown that the vaccine may be 
useful as adjuvant therapy for anal cancer. There is a need for public health 
strategies aimed at education of both patients and practitioners to improve the 
use of the vaccine for prevention of HPV-related anal cancer. The development of 
a therapeutic vaccine is a work in progress.

Cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive condition, is the most common fatal 
genetic disease affecting children and young adults in Canada. It is caused by 
mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, located on 
chromosome seven. This gene encodes for a chloride channel that regulates 
transport of salt and water across cell membranes. When CFTR is dysfunctional, 
secretions become tenacious and sticky, resulting in pathology in multiple organ 
systems, most notably the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Although there is no 
cure for the underlying disease process, current therapies have increased the 
overall survival of CF patients, with the median life expectancy now at 48 years 
based on recent Canadian statistics. The goals of CF therapy until now have 
been: (1) preservation of lung function by minimizing pulmonary infection and 
inflammation; (2) restoration of baseline pulmonary function, symptoms, and 
level of inflammation following acute respiratory exacerbations; and (3) 
maintenance of adequate nutrition. Therapeutic strategy consists of a 
combination of physiotherapy, pharmacologic drugs (i.e., antibiotics, 
anti-inflammatory drugs, mucolytic drugs), nutritional treatments (i.e., 
high-calorie and high-fat diets) and pancreatic enzyme replacement for those 
with pancreatic insufficiency. To date, no therapies have addressed the 
underlying genetic defect or corrected the abnormal functioning of CFTR. 
Ivacaftor is a first-in-class oral CFTR potentiator approved by Health Canada 
for the treatment of CF in patients aged six years and older who have G551D, 
G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R, or G970R mutation in 
the CFTR gene. The drug works by prolonging the time that activated CFTR 
channels remain open, thereby enhancing the regulation of chloride and water 
transport across cell membranes. It is available as a 150 mg oral tablet. The 
Health Canada recommended dose is 150 mg every 12 hours with fat-containing 
food. The manufacturer is seeking a listing recommendation based on the Health 
Canada indication. Accordingly, a systematic review was undertaken to evaluate 
the beneficial and harmful effects of ivacaftor 150 mg for the treatment of CF 
in patients age six years and older who have a G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, 
G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R, or G970R mutation in the CFTR gene.

The Phase 3 A-LONG and Kids A-LONG studies demonstrated the prolonged half-life 
of rFVIIIFc compared with rFVIII, and the safety and efficacy of rFVIIIFc in 
subjects with severe haemophilia A. Eligible subjects from A-LONG and Kids 
A-LONG continued rFVIIIFc treatment by enrolling in ASPIRE, an ongoing extension 
study. Based on combined data from the primary studies and ASPIRE interim data, 
the safety and efficacy of rFVIIIFc in subjects requiring surgery were 
evaluated. Perioperative dosing regimens were determined by investigators with 
guidance based on pharmacokinetic data and recommendations from a clinical 
dosing committee. In addition to dosing frequency, factor consumption, blood 
loss, transfusions, bleeding episodes, and haemostatic response were assessed. 
Across studies, 21 subjects underwent 23 evaluable major surgeries, including 19 
orthopaedic surgeries; 41 subjects underwent 52 minor surgeries, including 30 
dental procedures. No major and 10 minor surgeries were performed in paediatric 
subjects. Of the major (n = 22) and minor (n = 32) surgeries assessed for 
haemostatic response, all were rated as excellent or good by the 
investigator/surgeon. During most major surgeries (95.7 %), haemostasis was 
maintained with one rFVIIIFc infusion. Blood loss in major surgeries was 
consistent with similar surgeries in subjects without haemophilia. Across 
studies, rFVIIIFc was well tolerated; no subject developed an inhibitor.

Life Expectancy of People with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

Thanh NX, Jonsson E.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the life expectancy and specify the causes of death 
among people with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
METHODS: Included were all patients recorded in Alberta provincial databases of 
inpatients, outpatients, or practitioner claims from 2003 to 2012. People with 
FAS were identified by ICD-9 code 760.71 and ICD-10 codes Q86.0 and P04.3, and 
were linked to the Vital Statistics Death Registry to get information about 
mortality. Life expectancy was estimated by using the life table template 
developed in the United Kingdom, which is recommended for estimating life 
expectancy in small areas or populations.
RESULTS: The life expectancy at birth of people with FAS was 34 years (95% 
confidence interval: 31 to 37 years), which was about 42% of that of the general 
population. The leading causes of death for people with FAS were "external 
causes" (44%), which include suicide (15%), accidents (14%), poisoning by 
illegal drugs or alcohol (7%), and other external causes (7%). Other common 
causes of death were diseases of the nervous and respiratory systems (8% each), 
diseases of the digestive system (7%), congenital malformations (7%), mental and 
behavioural disorders (4%), and diseases of the circulatory system (4%).
CONCLUSION: The life expectancy of people with FAS is considerably lower than 
that of the general population. As the cause of FAS is known and preventable, 
more attention devoted to the prevention of FAS is urgently needed.

OBJECTIVES: To relate major causes of death with lifestyle habits in an almost 
extinct male middle-aged population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 40-59 aged male population of 1712 subjects was examined 
and followed-up for 50 years. Baseline smoking habits, working physical activity 
and dietary habits were related to 50 years mortality subdivided into 12 simple 
and 3 composite causes of death by Cox proportional hazard models. Duration of 
survival was related to the same characteristics by a multiple linear regression 
model.
RESULTS: Death rate in 50 years was of 97.5%. Out of 12 simple groups of causes 
of death, 6 were related to smoking habits, 3 to physical activity and 4 to 
dietary habits. Among composite groups of causes of death, hazard ratios (and 
their 95% confidence limits) of never smokers versus smokers were 0.68 
(0.57-0.81) for major cardiovascular diseases; 0.65 (0.52-0.81) for all cancers; 
and 0.72 (0.64-0.81) for all-cause deaths. Hazard ratios of vigorous physical 
activity at work versus sedentary physical activity were 0.63 (0.49-0.80) for 
major cardiovascular diseases; 1.01 (0.72-1.41) for all cancers; and 0.76 
(0.64-0.90) for all-cause deaths. Hazard ratios of Mediterranean Diet versus 
non-Mediterranean Diet were 0.68 (0.54-0.86) for major cardiovascular diseases; 
0.54 (0.40-0.73) for all cancers; and 0.67 (0.57-0.78) for all-cause deaths. 
Expectancy of life was 12 years longer for men with the 3 best behaviors than 
for those with the 3 worst behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: Some lifestyle habits are strongly related to lifetime mortality.

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical importance of 
incidental focal or diffuse fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) uptake in the 
thyroid gland on positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and 
to evaluate the additive value of thyroid ultrasonography (US) in defining the 
malignancy potential of thyroid incidentalomas.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1450 patients, who had undergone a PET/CT scan 
for staging or restaging of various malignancies, were screened retrospectively 
and 52 (3.6%) patients with focal or diffuse F-FDG uptake in the thyroid gland 
on PET/CT were enrolled in the study. None of the patients had any history of 
thyroid diseases. Thyroid US with elastography for a thyroid nodule was 
performed for all the patients cross-sectionally. Thyroid fine-needle aspiration 
biopsy (FNAB) was also applied at the same time as the thyroid US to 34 patients 
with a nodule(s) 10 mm or more in diameter or less than 10 mm, but with 
malignancy potential ultrasonographically. The cytology results were compared 
with the thyroid US and F-FDG PET/CT findings.
RESULTS: Although 39 patients had focal (group 1) F-FDG uptake in the thyroid 
gland, the remaining 13 patients had diffuse (group 2) uptake. In group 1, FNAB 
was performed in 32 patients. In 10 of 32 (31%) patients, FNAB results were 
concordant with malignant cytology (seven primary thyroid malignancy and three 
metastasis to thyroid). In group 2, in one of two patients who had undergone 
FNAB, malignant cytology (metastasis to thyroid) was detected. Although the 
difference between the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of malignant 
and benign nodules was statistically significant (10.2±8.9 vs. 5.6±3.0, 
P=0.013), the difference between the nodule sizes was not statistically 
significant (20.0±7.3 vs. 16.7±7.4, P=0.923). The presence of suspicious US 
findings and a high elastography score (≥4) were also statistically significant 
(P<0.001 and P=0.035, respectively). In the receiver-operator characteristic 
analysis, a 5.3 cut-off SUVmax was calculated with 82% sensitivity and 65% 
specificity for predicting malignant cytology.
CONCLUSION: Focal F-FDG uptake was associated with a higher prevalence of 
malignant thyroid nodule compared with diffuse F-FDG uptake. In particular, if a 
focal thyroid incidentaloma with high SUVmax (>5.5), suspicious US findings, and 
a high elastography score (≥4) is detected, a pathological diagnosis, either by 
histology or by cytology examination, should be made, especially when the 
patient has a long life expectancy.

Economic Evaluation of Treatments for Pediatric Bilateral Severe to Profound 
Sensorineural Hearing Loss: An Australian Perspective.

Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB), School of Medicine and Public Health, The 
University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia ‡Cochlear AG Europe, Europe

OBJECTIVES: In Australia, surgical treatment options for children with bilateral 
severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss exist in a continuum ranging from 
unilateral cochlear implantation (CI), sequential bilateral CI through to 
simultaneous bilateral CI, depending on the condition. When treatment options 
are mutually exclusive, the mean costs and benefits of each treatment group are 
summed together to obtain the total mean costs and benefits. This enables an 
incremental analysis of treatment options in the context of the treated 
populations.The objective was to evaluate the cost-utility of current Australian 
CI treatment practices in children using domestic costs and consequences when 
compared with bilateral hearing aids (HAs).
RESEARCH DESIGN: Economic evaluation including a Markov model based on secondary 
sources.
SETTING: The base case modeled a government health payer perspective over a 
child's lifetime. Primary and secondary school education costs were also 
assessed.
INTERVENTION: Bilateral HAs compared with CI, including unilateral, sequential 
bilateral, or simultaneous bilateral CI weighted according to treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs per quality adjusted life year.
RESULTS: Approximately 42% of children in Australia with unilateral CI did not 
transition to sequential bilateral nor undergo simultaneous bilateral 
implantation. This differs from previous economic evaluations that assumed 100% 
of children transitioned to sequential bilateral CI treatment or were treated 
with simultaneous bilateral CI.The incremental cost utility of unilateral 
cochlear implantation compared with HAs was AUD 21,947/QALY. The weighted 
average incremental cost utility of the combined cochlear implantation treatment 
groups was AUD 31,238/QALY when compared with HAs.
CONCLUSION: Previous economic evaluations of cochlear implantation assumed 100% 
of unilaterally treated patients would transition to sequential bilateral or be 
treated with simultaneous bilateral implantation. This approach does not take 
into account the total treated population, where a proportion of patients are 
treated with unilateral CI.CI was cost effective when compared with HAs, and 
included children treated with unilateral, sequential bilateral, and 
simultaneous bilateral CI.The model was sensitive to the number of assessment 
and habilitation visits. Alternative health service models with cost 
efficiencies are needed to reduce after care costs.

Cost-Utility Analysis of Cochlear Implantation in Australian Adults.

Foteff C(1), Kennedy S, Milton AH, Deger M, Payk F, Sanderson G.

Author information:
(1)*Cochlear Limited, Macquarie University, Sydney †Centre for Clinical 
Epidemiology and Biostatistics (CCEB), School of Medicine and Public Health, The 
University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia ‡Cochlear AG Europe, Europe 
Middle East and Africa Headquarters, Basel, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVES: Sequential and simultaneous bilateral cochlear implants are emerging 
as appropriate treatment options for Australian adults with sensory deficits in 
both cochleae. Current funding of Australian public hospitals does not provide 
for simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation (CI) as a separate surgical 
procedure. Previous cost-effectiveness studies of sequential and simultaneous 
bilateral CI assumed 100% of unilaterally treated patients' transition to a 
sequential bilateral CI. This assumption does not place cochlear implantation in 
the context of the generally treated population. When mutually exclusive 
treatment options exist, such as unilateral CI, sequential bilateral CI, and 
simultaneous bilateral CI, the mean costs of the treated populations are 
weighted in the calculation of incremental cost-utility ratios. The objective 
was to evaluate the cost-utility of bilateral hearing aids (HAs) compared with 
unilateral, sequential, and simultaneous bilateral CI in Australian adults with 
bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis of secondary sources input to a Markov 
model.
SETTING: Australian health care perspective, lifetime horizon with costs and 
outcomes discounted 5% annually.
INTERVENTION: Bilateral HAs as treatment for bilateral severe to profound 
sensorineural hearing loss compared with unilateral, sequential, and 
simultaneous bilateral CI.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs per quality adjusted life year 
(AUD/QALY).
RESULTS: When compared with bilateral hearing aids the incremental cost-utility 
ratio for the CI treatment population was AUD11,160/QALY. The incremental 
cost-utility ratio was weighted according to the number of patients treated 
unilaterally, sequentially, and simultaneously, as these were mutually exclusive 
treatment options.
CONCLUSION: No peer-reviewed articles have reported the incremental analysis of 
cochlear implantation in a continuum of care for surgically treated populations 
with bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Unilateral, 
sequential, and simultaneous bilateral CI were cost-effective when compared with 
bilateral hearing aids. Technologies that reduce the total number of visits for 
a patient could introduce additional cost efficiencies into clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Although drug-eluting stents (DES) have been widely incorporated 
into clinical practice in developed countries, several countries restrict their 
use mainly because of their high cost and unfavorable incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DES in comparison with 
bare-metal stents (BMS) for treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD).
DESIGN: Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: Published literature, government database, and CAD patient cohort.
TARGET POPULATION: Single-vessel CAD patients.
TIME HORIZON: One year and lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Brazilian Public Health System (SUS).
INTERVENTION: Six strategies composed of percutaneous intervention with a BMS or 
1 of 5 DES (paclitaxel, sirolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus, and zotarolimus 
resolute).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost for target vessel revascularization avoided and cost for 
quality-adjusted life year gained.
BASE CASE ANALYSIS: In the short-term analysis, sirolimus was the most effective 
and least costly among DES (ICER of I$20,642 per target vessel revascularization 
avoided), with all others DES dominated by sirolimus. Lifetime cumulative costs 
ranged from I$18,765 to I$21,400. In the base case analysis, zotarolimus 
resolute had the most favorable ICER among the DES (ICER I$62,761), with 
sirolimus, paclitaxel, and zotarolimus being absolute dominated and everolimus 
extended dominated by zotarolimus resolute, although all the results were above 
the willingness-to-pay threshold of 3 times the gross domestic product per 
capita (I$35,307).
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In deterministic sensitivity analysis, results were 
sensitive to cost of DES, number of stents used per patient, baseline 
probability, and duration of stent thrombosis risk. The probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis demonstrated a probability of 81% for BMS being the 
strategy of choice, with 9% for everolimus and 9% zotarolimus resolute, at the 
willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSION: DES is not a good value for money in SUS perspective, despite its 
benefit in reducing target vessel revascularization. Since the 
cost-effectiveness of DES is mainly driven by the stents' cost difference, they 
should cost less than twice the BMS price to become a cost-effective 
alternative.

Diabetes is the pandemic disease of the modern era, with 10% of these patients 
having type 1 diabetes mellitus. Despite the prevalence, morbidities, and 
associated financial burden, treatment options have not changed since the 
introduction of injectable insulin. To date, over 40,000 pancreas transplants 
have been performed globally. It remains the only known method for restoring 
glycemic control and thus curing type 1 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this 
review is to bring pancreatic transplantation out of the specialist realm, 
informing practitioners about this important procedure, so that they feel better 
equipped to refer suitable patients for transplantation and manage, counsel, and 
support when encountering them within their own specialty. This study was a 
narrative review conducted in October 2015, with OVID interface searching EMBASE 
and MEDLINE databases, using Timeframe: Inception to October 2015. Articles were 
assessed for clinical relevance and most up-to-date content, with articles 
written in English as the only inclusion criterion. Other sources used included 
conference proceedings/presentations and unpublished data from our institution 
(Oxford Transplant Centre). Pancreatic transplantation is growing and has 
quickly become the gold standard of care for patients with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus and renal failure. Significant improvements in quality of life and life 
expectancy make pancreatic transplant a viable and economically feasible 
intervention. It remains the most effective method of establishing and 
maintaining euglycemia, halting and potentially reversing complications 
associated with diabetes.

Lipidomics, which focuses on the global study of molecular lipids in biological 
systems, has been driven tremendously by technical advances in mass spectrometry 
(MS) instrumentation, particularly high-resolution MS. This requires powerful 
computational tools that handle the high-throughput lipidomics data analysis. To 
address this issue, a novel computational tool has been developed for the 
analysis of high-resolution MS data, including the data pretreatment, 
visualization, automated identification, deconvolution and quantification of 
lipid species. The algorithm features the customized generation of a lipid 
compound library and mass spectral library, which covers the major lipid classes 
such as glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Next, the 
algorithm performs least squares resolution of spectra and chromatograms based 
on the theoretical isotope distribution of molecular ions, which enables 
automated identification and quantification of molecular lipid species. 
Currently, this methodology supports analysis of both high and low resolution MS 
as well as liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) lipidomics data. The flexibility of 
the methodology allows it to be expanded to support more lipid classes and more 
data interpretation functions, making it a promising tool in lipidomic data 
analysis.

BACKGROUNDS: Primary aortoenteric fistula (PAEF) is a lethal cause of 
gastrointestinal bleeding. They mainly originate from eroding abdominal aortic 
aneurysms into the intestinal wall. Other known causes involve malignancies, 
infection, corpora aliena, or radiation therapy. Traditional treatment consists 
of resection of the fistula and extra-anatomic reconstruction. In situ repair 
and endovascular stenting have offered new therapeutic options in managing this 
complex entity.
CASE REPORT: A 79-year-old woman presented with a PAEF. She was known with a 
3.9-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm and polymyalgia rheumatica. The initial 
treatment consisted of endovascular stenting. Several months later, she 
presented with persistent inflammation of the aortic endoprosthesis. The 
prosthesis and inflammatory tissue were resected, and in situ reconstruction 
with autologous superficial femoral vein and omentoplasty was performed. Two 
years later, she remains well with no evidence for infection or bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymyalgia rheumatica might induce an AEF as in this patient no 
other provoking factors were retained. The different therapeutic options all 
have their advantages and disadvantages. In line with this case, we suggest an 
individualized approach for AEFs. In case of precarious hemodynamical state or 
life expectancy, endovascular treatment is indicated. Afterward, the possibility 
and/or necessity of open repair should be discussed. For stable patients with 
respectable life expectancy in situ repair with autologuous vein or 
rifampicin-soaked prosthesis (adjusted to comorbidities) might be most 
appropriate. Extra-anatomic reconstruction still remains a valuable alternative 
in older patients and in the presence of any other local factors hampering in 
situ reconstruction.

BACKGROUND: Protease inhibitor (PI) monotherapy can maintain virological 
suppression in the majority of patients once it has been established on triple 
therapy and may also have the potential for substantial cost savings arising 
from the use of fewer drugs. However, the cost effectiveness of PI monotherapy 
has yet to be demonstrated.
OBJECTIVES: In this study we examine the cost effectiveness of PI monotherapy 
with prompt return to combination therapy in the event of viral load rebound 
compared with ongoing triple therapy (OT) in patients with suppressed viral load 
on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the UK.
METHODS: The analysis used data from the PIVOT trial in which HIV-positive 
adults with suppressed viral load for ≥24 weeks on combination ART were 
randomised to maintain OT or to a strategy of PI monotherapy with prompt return 
to combination therapy if viral load rebounded. A cost-effectiveness analysis 
including long-term modelling was conducted. Main outcomes included UK National 
Health Service (NHS) costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with 
comparative results presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: PI monotherapy was cost saving as a result of large savings in ART drug 
costs while being no less effective in terms of QALYs in the within-trial 
analysis and marginally less effective with lifetime modelling. In the base-case 
analysis over 3 years, the incremental total cost per patient was -£6424.11 
(95 % confidence interval -7418.84 to -5429.38) and incremental QALYs were 
0.0051 (95 % CI -0.0479 to 0.0582), resulting in PI monotherapy 'dominating' OT. 
Multiple scenario analyses found that PI monotherapy was cost saving with no 
marked differences in QALYs. Modelling of lifetime costs and QALYs showed that 
PI monotherapy was associated with significant cost savings and was marginally 
less effective; PI monotherapy was cost effective at accepted cost-effectiveness 
thresholds in all but one scenario analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Under most assumptions, PI monotherapy appears to be a 
cost-effective treatment strategy compared with OT for HIV-infected patients who 
have achieved sustained virological suppression.

The last century in Brazil was witness to profound changes. Female life 
expectancy at birth increased from 34.6 years in 1910 to 77.26 years in 2010. At 
the same time, the educational composition of the population has changed 
dramatically. In the 1940s, only 25% of the children aged 5-14 years old were 
enrolled in school. Currently, nearly all children attend school. We examine the 
extent to which changes in the age-specific distribution of education have 
contributed to the decline in adult mortality among women in Brazil. Our 
analysis follows other applications in the literature to measure the mortality 
reduction that would occur if exposure to specific risk factors was changed at 
the counterfactual level. The effects are not trivial: Between 1960 and 2010, 
about 38% of the increase in life expectancy at age 30 can be attributed to 
changes in the educational composition of women. An additional 22% increase is 
expected until 2040.

Active surveillance (AS) is a management strategy involving close monitoring the 
course of disease with the expectation to intervene if the cancer progress, in a 
super-selected group of low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Determining AS 
candidates should be based on careful individualized weighing of numerous 
factors: life expectancy, general health condition, disease characteristics, 
potential side effects of treatment, and patient preference. Several protocols 
have been developed to determine insignificant PCa for choosing ideal AS 
candidates. Results regarding disease reclassification during AS have been also 
reported. In an effort to enhance accuracy during selection of AS candidate, 
there were several reports on using magnetic resonance imaging for prediction of 
insignificant PCa. Currently, there is an urgent need for further clinical 
studies regarding the criteria for recommending AS, the criteria for 
reclassification on AS, and the schedule for AS. Considering the racial 
differences in behavior of PCa between Western and Asian populations, more 
stringent AS protocols for Asian patients should be established from additional, 
well-designed, large clinical studies.
