OBJECTIVE: To determine how cognitively healthy and cognitively impaired life 
expectancy have changed from 2000 to 2010 among American men and women 65 years 
of age and over.
METHODS: The prevalence of dementia, cognitive impairment without dementia 
(CIND), and normal cognition is determined from the nationally representative 
data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Mortality rates are from 
U.S. Decennial Life Table for 2000 and the U.S. annual life table for 2010. Life 
expectancy by cognitive status is estimated using the Sullivan method.
RESULTS: Most of the increase in life expectancy has been concentrated in 
cognitively healthy years in this 10 year period. The increase in expected years 
cognitively intact at age 65, which exceeded that in total life expectancy, was 
1.8 for men and 1.6 for women.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence suggesting that there has been a 
compression of cognitive morbidity.

Decision-Making Regarding Mammography Screening for Older Women.

Schonberg MA(1).

Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, 
Massachusetts.

The population is aging, and breast cancer incidence increases with age, peaking 
between the ages of 75 and 79. However, it is not known whether mammography 
screening helps women aged 75 and older live longer because they have not been 
included in randomized controlled trials evaluating mammography screening. 
Guidelines recommend that older women with less than a 10-year life expectancy 
not be screened because it takes approximately 10 years before a screen-detected 
breast cancer may affect an older woman's survival. Guidelines recommend that 
clinicians discuss the benefits and risks of screening with women aged 75 and 
older with a life expectancy of 10 years or longer to help them elicit their 
values and preferences. It is estimated that two of 1,000 women who continue to 
be screened every other year from age 70 to 79 may avoid breast cancer death, 
but 12% to 27% of these women will experience a false-positive test, and 10% to 
20% of women who experience a false-positive test will undergo a breast biopsy. 
In addition, approximately 30% of screen-detected cancers would not otherwise 
have shown up in an older woman's lifetime, yet nearly all older women undergo 
treatment for these breast cancers, and the risks of treatment increase with 
age. To inform decision-making, tools are available to estimate life expectancy 
and to educate older women about the benefits and harms of mammography 
screening. Guides are also available to help clinicians discuss stopping 
screening with older women with less than a 10-year life expectancy. Ideally, 
screening decisions would consider an older woman's life expectancy, breast 
cancer risk, and her values and preferences.

BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with a higher risk 
of important adverse outcomes. Practice varies and the best strategy for 
identifying and treating GDM is unclear.
AIM: To estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of strategies 
for identifying and treating women with GDM.
METHODS: We analysed individual participant data (IPD) from birth cohorts and 
conducted systematic reviews to estimate the association of maternal glucose 
levels with adverse perinatal outcomes; GDM prevalence; maternal 
characteristics/risk factors for GDM; and the effectiveness and costs of 
treatments. The cost-effectiveness of various strategies was estimated using a 
decision tree model, along with a value of information analysis to assess where 
future research might be worthwhile. Detailed systematic searches of MEDLINE® 
and MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations®, EMBASE, Cumulative Index 
to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of 
Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment database, NHS 
Economic Evaluation Database, Maternity and Infant Care database and the 
Cochrane Methodology Register were undertaken from inception up to October 2014.
RESULTS: We identified 58 studies examining maternal glucose levels and outcome 
associations. Analyses using IPD alone and the systematic review demonstrated 
continuous linear associations of fasting and post-load glucose levels with 
adverse perinatal outcomes, with no clear threshold below which there is no 
increased risk. Using IPD, we estimated glucose thresholds to identify infants 
at high risk of being born large for gestational age or with high adiposity; for 
South Asian (SA) women these thresholds were fasting and post-load glucose 
levels of 5.2 mmol/l and 7.2 mmol/l, respectively and for white British (WB) 
women they were 5.4 and 7.5 mmol/l, respectively. Prevalence using IPD and 
published data varied from 1.2% to 24.2% (depending on criteria and population) 
and was consistently two to three times higher in SA women than in WB women. 
Lowering thresholds to identify GDM, particularly in women of SA origin, 
identifies more women at risk, but increases costs. Maternal characteristics did 
not accurately identify women with GDM; there was limited evidence that in some 
populations risk factors may be useful for identifying low-risk women. Dietary 
modification additional to routine care reduced the risk of most adverse 
perinatal outcomes. Metformin (Glucophage,® Teva UK Ltd, Eastbourne, UK) and 
insulin were more effective than glibenclamide (Aurobindo Pharma - Milpharm Ltd, 
South Ruislip, Middlesex, UK). For all strategies to identify and treat GDM, the 
costs exceeded the health benefits. A policy of no screening/testing or 
treatment offered the maximum expected net monetary benefit (NMB) of £1184 at a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). 
The NMB for the three best-performing strategies in each category (screen only, 
then treat; screen, test, then treat; and test all, then treat) ranged between 
-£1197 and -£1210. Further research to reduce uncertainty around potential 
longer-term benefits for the mothers and offspring, find ways of improving the 
accuracy of identifying women with GDM, and reduce costs of identification and 
treatment would be worthwhile.
LIMITATIONS: We did not have access to IPD from populations in the UK outside of 
England. Few observational studies reported longer-term associations, and 
treatment trials have generally reported only perinatal outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the national standard cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 
per QALY it is not cost-effective to routinely identify pregnant women for 
treatment of hyperglycaemia. Further research to provide evidence on longer-term 
outcomes, and more cost-effective ways to detect and treat GDM, would be 
valuable.

Animals learn through experience and consolidate the memories into long-time 
storage. Conditioning parameters to induce protein synthesis-dependent long-term 
memory (LTM) have been the subject of extensive studies in many animals. Here we 
found a case in which a conditioning trial inhibits or facilitates LTM formation 
depending on the intervals from preceding trials. We studied the effects of 
conditioning parameters on LTM formation in olfactory conditioning of 
maxillary-palpi extension response with sucrose reward in the cockroach 
Periplaneta americana We found, at first, that translation- and 
transcription-dependent LTM forms 1 h after training, the fastest so far 
reported in insects. Second, we observed that multiple-trial training with an 
intertrial interval (ITI) of 20 or 30 sec, often called massed training, is more 
effective than spaced training for LTM formation, an observation that differs 
from the results of most studies in other animals. Third, we found that a 
conditioning trial inhibits LTM formation when the intervals from preceding 
trials were in the range of 10-16 min. This inhibitory effect is 
pairing-specific and is not due to decreased motivation for learning 
(overtraining effect). To our knowledge, no similar inhibition of LTM formation 
by a conditioning trial has been reported in any animals. We propose a model to 
account for the effects of trial number and ITIs on LTM formation. Olfactory 
conditioning in cockroaches should provide pertinent materials in which to study 
neuronal and molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory and facilitatory 
processes for LTM formation.

Purpose A stepped care (SC) program in which an effective yet least 
resource-intensive treatment is delivered to patients first and followed, when 
necessary, by more resource-intensive treatments was found to be effective in 
improving distress levels of patients with head and neck cancer or lung cancer. 
Information on the value of this program for its cost is now called for. 
Therefore, this study aimed to assess the cost-utility of the SC program 
compared with care-as-usual (CAU) in patients with head and neck cancer or lung 
cancer who have psychological distress. Patients and Methods In total, 156 
patients were randomly assigned to SC or CAU. Intervention costs, direct medical 
costs, direct nonmedical costs, productivity losses, and health-related 
quality-of-life data during the intervention or control period and 12 months of 
follow-up were calculated by using Trimbos and Institute of Medical Technology 
Assessment Cost Questionnaire for Psychiatry, Productivity and Disease 
Questionnaire, and EuroQol-5 Dimension measures and data from the hospital 
information system. The SC program's value for the cost was investigated by 
comparing mean cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results 
After imputation of missing data, mean cumulative costs were -€3,950 (95% CI, 
-€8,158 to -€190) lower, and mean number of QALYs was 0.116 (95% CI, 0.005 to 
0.227) higher in the intervention group compared with the control group. The 
intervention group had a probability of 96% that cumulative QALYs were higher 
and cumulative costs were lower than in the control group. Four additional 
analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of this finding, and they found 
that the intervention group had a probability of 84% to 98% that cumulative 
QALYs were higher and a probability of 91% to 99% that costs were lower than in 
the control group. Conclusion SC is highly likely to be cost-effective; the 
number of QALYs was higher and cumulative costs were lower for SC compared with 
CAU.

IMPORTANCE: Emerging evidence suggests that the use of moisturizers on newborns 
and infants (ie, from birth to 6 months of age) is potentially helpful in 
preventing the development of atopic dermatitis.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of using a daily moisturizer as 
prevention against atopic dermatitis among high-risk newborns.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a cost-effectiveness analysis, the average 
cost of total-body moisturization using 7 common moisturizers from birth to 6 
months of age was determined for male and female infants. We assumed the same 
unit of weight per moisturizer used for a given body surface area. Based on 
previously reported data (relative risk reduction of 50%), the incremental gain 
in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was determined using a 6-month time 
window. The cost-effectiveness of each moisturizer was determined by assuming 
equal efficacy. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying the relative 
risk from 0.28 to 0.90.
INTERVENTIONS: Use of prophylactic moisturizing compounds.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the incremental 
cost-effectiveness values ($/QALY) for each moisturizer in preventing atopic 
dermatitis during a 6-month time window.
RESULTS: The calculated amount of daily all-body moisturizer needed at birth was 
3.6 g (0.12 oz) per application, which increased to 6.6 g (0.22 oz) at 6 months 
of age. Of the 7 products evaluated, the average price was $1.07/oz (range, 
$0.13/oz-$2.96/oz). For a 6-month time window, the average incremental QALY 
benefit was 0.021. The sensitivity analysis showed that the incremental gain of 
QALY ranged from 0.0041 to 0.030. Petrolatum was the most cost-effective 
($353/QALY [95% CI, $244-$1769/QALY) moisturizer in the cohort. Even assuming 
the lowest incremental QALYs for the most expensive moisturizer, the 
intervention was still less than $45 000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall, atopic dermatitis represents a major health 
expenditure and has been associated with multiple comorbidities. Daily 
moisturization may represent a cost-effective, preventative strategy to reduce 
the burden of atopic dermatitis.

IMPORTANCE: Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Current 
estimates on the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), 
years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 
cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system 
data, cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using 
separately estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy 
data. Cancer incidence was calculated by dividing mortality estimates through 
the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer prevalence, MI ratios were used to 
model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by 
disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer 
deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs 
and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on 
income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were 
categorized by SDI quintiles to summarize results.
FINDINGS: In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 
million deaths. Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with 
population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in 
age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globally was 
prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the 
leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 
million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million 
cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for 
women (523 000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 
million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, 
age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 
195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all 
cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or 
territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were 
largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 
and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1% [95% uncertainty 
interval (UI), -10.6% to -1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for 
esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these 
results were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer 
incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited 
health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer 
prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed 
knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate 
that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings 
also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco 
control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Limited data exist on health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) after intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). We aimed to determine baseline 
factors associated with HRQoL among participants of the pilot and main phases of 
the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trials 
(INTERACT 1 and 2).
METHODS: The INTERACT studies were randomised controlled trials of early 
intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering in patients with ICH (<6 hours) and 
elevated systolic BP (150-220 mm Hg). HRQoL was determined using the European 
Quality of Life Scale (EQ-5D) at 90 days, completed by patients or proxy 
responders. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify 
factors associated with poor overall HRQoL.
RESULTS: 2756 patients were included. Demographic, clinical and radiological 
factors associated with lower EQ-5D utility score were age, randomisation 
outside of China, antithrombotic use, high baseline National Institutes of 
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, larger ICH, presence of intraventricular 
extension and use of proxy responders. High (≥14) NIHSS score, larger ICH and 
proxy responders were associated with low scores in all five dimensions of the 
EQ-5D. The NIHSS score had a strong association with poor HRQoL (p<0.001). 
Female gender and antithrombotic use were associated with decreased scores in 
dimensions of pain/discomfort and usual activity, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Poor HRQoL was associated with age, comorbidities, proxy source of 
assessment, clinical severity and ICH characteristics. The strongest association 
was with initial clinical severity defined by high NIHSS score.

Ageing is driven by a loss of transcriptional and protein homeostasis and is the 
key risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Interventions that attenuate or 
reverse systemic dysfunction associated with age therefore have the potential to 
reduce overall disease risk in the elderly. Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing 
is a fundamental link between gene expression and the proteome, and deregulation 
of the splicing machinery is linked to several age-related chronic illnesses. 
However, the role of splicing homeostasis in healthy ageing remains unclear. 
Here we demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and 
predictor of life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using transcriptomics 
and in-depth splicing analysis in young and old animals fed ad libitum or 
subjected to dietary restriction, we find defects in global pre-mRNA splicing 
with age that are reduced by dietary restriction via splicing factor 1 (SFA-1; 
the C. elegans homologue of SF1, also known as branchpoint binding protein, 
BBP). We show that SFA-1 is specifically required for lifespan extension by 
dietary restriction and by modulation of the TORC1 pathway components AMPK, 
RAGA-1 and RSKS-1/S6 kinase. We also demonstrate that overexpression of SFA-1 is 
sufficient to extend lifespan. Together, these data demonstrate a role for RNA 
splicing homeostasis in dietary restriction longevity and suggest that 
modulation of specific spliceosome components may prolong healthy ageing.

BACKGROUND: Nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (NAB-P + GEM) and FOLFIRINOX have 
shown superior efficacy over gemcitabine (GEM) in the treatment of metastatic 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDA). Although the incremental clinical 
benefits are modest, both treatments represent significant advances in the 
treatment of a high-mortality cancer. In this independent economic evaluation 
for the US, the aim was to estimate the comparative cost-utility and 
cost-effectiveness of these three regimens from the payer perspective.
METHODS: In the absence of a direct treatment comparison in a single clinical 
trial, the Bucher indirect comparison method was used to estimate the 
comparative efficacy of each regimen. A Markov model evaluated life years (LY) 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained with NAB-P + GEM and FOLFIRINOX 
over GEM, expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) and cost-utility 
ratios (ICUR). All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%/year. The impact of 
parameter uncertainty on the model was assessed by probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: NAB-P + GEM was associated with differentials of +0.180 LY and +0.127 
QALY gained over GEM at an incremental total cost of $25,965; yielding an ICER 
of $144,096/LY and ICUR of $204,369/QALY gained. FOLFIRINOX was associated with 
differentials of +0.368 LY and +0.249 QALY gained over GEM at an incremental 
total cost of $93,045; yielding an ICER of $253,162/LY and ICUR of $372,813/QALY 
gained. In indirect comparison, the overall survival hazard ratio (OS HR) for 
NAB-P + GEM vs FOLFIRINOX was 0.79 (95%CI = 0.59-1.05), indicating no 
superiority in OS of either regimen. FOLFIRINOX had an ICER of $358,067/LY and 
an ICUR of $547,480/QALY gained over NAB-P + GEM. Tornado diagrams identified 
variation in the OS HR, but no other parameters, to impact the NAB-P + GEM and 
FOLFIRINOX ICURs.
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of a statistically significant difference in OS 
between NAB-P + GEM and FOLFIRINOX, this US analysis indicates that the greater 
economic benefit in terms of cost-savings and incremental cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility ratios favors NAB-P + GEM over FOLFIRINOX.

BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening 
(UKCTOCS) was the biggest ovarian cancer screening trial to date. A 
non-significant effect of screening on ovarian cancer was reported, but the 
authors noted a potential delayed effect of screening, and suggested the need 
for four years further follow-up. There are no UK-based cost-effectiveness 
analyses of ovarian cancer screening. Hence we assessed the lifetime outcomes 
associated with, and the cost-effectiveness of, screening for ovarian cancer in 
the UK, along with the value of further research.
METHODS: We performed a model-based economic evaluation. Effectiveness data were 
taken from UKCTOCS, which considered strategies of multimodal screening (MMS), 
ultrasound screening (USS) and no screening. We conducted systematic reviews to 
identify the remaining model inputs, and performed a rigorous and transparent 
prospective evaluation of different methods for extrapolating the effect of 
screening on ovarian cancer mortality. We considered costs to the UK healthcare 
system and measured effectiveness using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We 
used value of information methods to estimate the value of further research.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime, MMS and USS were estimated to be both more expensive 
and more effective than no screening. USS was dominated by MMS, being both more 
expensive and less effective. Compared with no screening, MMS cost on average 
£419 more (95% confidence interval £255 to £578), and generated 0.047 more QALYs 
(0.002 to 0.088). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing MMS 
with no screening was £8864 per QALY (£2600 to £51,576). Alternative 
extrapolation methods increased the ICER, with the highest value being £36,769 
(£13,888 to dominated by no screening). Using the UKCTOCS trial horizon, both 
MMS and USS were dominated by no screening, as they produced fewer QALYs at a 
greater cost. The value of research into eliminating all uncertainty in 
long-term effectiveness was estimated to be worth up to £20 million, or 
approximately £5 million for four years follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for ovarian cancer with MMS is both more effective and 
more expensive than not screening. Compared to national willingness to pay 
thresholds, lifetime cost-effectiveness is promising, but there remains 
considerable uncertainty regarding extrapolated long-term effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES: This article presents a cost-utility analysis from the Colombian 
health system perspective comparing primary prophylaxis to on-demand treatment 
using exogenous clotting factor VIII (FVIII) for patients with severe hemophilia 
type A.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate expected costs and outcomes 
(measured as quality-adjusted life-years, QALYs) for each strategy. Transition 
probabilities were estimated using published studies; utility weights were 
obtained from a sample of Colombian patients with hemophilia and costs were 
gathered using local data. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis were performed to assess the robustness of results.
RESULTS: The additional cost per QALY gained of primary prophylaxis compared 
with on-demand treatment was 105,081,022 Colombian pesos (COP) (55,204 USD), and 
thus not considered cost-effective according to a threshold of up to three times 
the current Colombian gross domestic product (GDP) per-capita. When primary 
prophylaxis was provided throughout life using recombinant FVIII (rFVIII), which 
is much costlier than FVIII, the additional cost per QALY gained reached 
174,159,553 COP (91,494 USD).
CONCLUSIONS: using a decision rule of up to three times the Colombian GDP per 
capita, primary prophylaxis (with either FVIII or rFVIII) would not be 
considered as cost-effective in this country. However, a final decision on 
providing or preventing patients from primary prophylaxis as a gold standard of 
care for severe hemophilia type A should also consider broader criteria than the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio results itself. Only a price reduction of 
exogenous FVIII of 50 percent or more would make primary prophylaxis 
cost-effective in this context.

The kidney allocation system that took effect on December 4, 2014 represents a 
significant improvement over the prior approach. It seeks to improve outcomes by 
longevity matching - pairing kidneys expected to function the longest with 
recipients expected to live the longest. It addresses the biological barriers 
faced by highly sensitized patients in an evidence based fashion and it begins 
to introduce the concept of medical need into kidney allocation by crediting 
time from the starting dialysis to a patient's waiting time. Additionally, it 
adds a more granular and continuous approach to classifying deceased donor 
kidneys through the kidney donor profile index and moves away from the 
dichotomous and flawed, standard criteria/extended criteria approach to 
allocating kidneys. Despite these changes, access to kidney transplantation 
across the age spectrum has remained intact and equitable. However even with 
these numerous positive improvements the system is not without its flaws. The 
increased sharing and by extension shipping of kidneys have created logistical 
challenges for organ procurement organizations and transplant centers. Early 
results seem to indicate that there have been an increase in cold ischemic time, 
an increase in delayed graft function and an increase in organ discard rate. 
There is also a reduced offer rate for children and while not a statistically 
significant decline in the number of transplants, it is a trend that requires 
close monitoring. Finally, the new kidney allocation system has done nothing to 
address the glaring deficiencies in the multi-organ allocation practices, all of 
which include a kidney, in the United States. Therefore despite the improvements 
made in kidney allocation, there is work yet to be done to ensure that the 
allocation of life saving and life prolonging organs for transplantation is done 
in a fashion consistent with ethical principles, based on science and free from 
local self interest so that this national resource is used for the betterment of 
the population it is meant to serve.
