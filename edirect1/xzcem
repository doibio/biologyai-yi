quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and resulting budget impact between 
ECHO and non-ECHO patients with HCV were then compared.
RESULTS: Project ECHO increased costs and QALYs. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of ECHO was $10,351 per QALY compared with the status 
quo; >99.9% of iterations fell below the willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000 per QALY. We were unable to confirm whether the increase in rates of 
treatment associated with Project ECHO were due to increased or more targeted 
screening, higher adherence, or access to treatment. Our sensitivity analyses 
show that the results are largely independent of the cause. Budget impact 
analysis shows payers would have to invest an additional $339.54 million over a 
5-year period to increase treatment by 4446 patients, per 1 million covered 
lives.
CONCLUSION: Using a simulated primary care patient panel, we showed that Project 
ECHO is a cost-effective way to find and treat patients with HCV infection at 
scale using existing primary care providers. This approach could substantially 
reduce the burden of chronic HCV infection in the United States, but high 
budgetary costs suggest that incremental rollout of ECHO may be best.

BACKGROUND: Presentation with advanced glaucoma is the major risk factor for 
lifetime blindness. Effective intervention at diagnosis is expected to minimise 
risk of further visual loss in this group of patients.
AIM: To compare clinical and cost-effectiveness of primary medical management 
compared with primary surgery for people presenting with advanced open-angle 
glaucoma (OAG).
METHODS: Design: A prospective, pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled 
trial (RCT).
SETTING: Twenty-seven UK hospital eye services.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and forty patients presenting with advanced OAG, 
according to the Hodapp-Parish-Anderson classification of visual field loss.
INTERVENTION: Participants will be randomised to medical treatment or augmented 
trabeculectomy (1:1 allocation minimised by centre and presence of advanced 
disease in both eyes).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is vision-related quality of life 
measured by the National Eye Institute-Visual Function Questionnaire-25 at 24 
months. Secondary outcomes include generic EQ-5D-5L, Health Utility Index-3 and 
glaucoma-related health status (Glaucoma Utility Index), patient experience, 
visual field measured by mean deviation value, logarithm of the mean angle of 
resolution visual acuity, intraocular pressure, adverse events, standards for 
driving and eligibility for blind certification. Incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) based on EQ-5D-5L and glaucoma profile 
instrument will be estimated.
RESULTS: The study will report the comparative effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of medical treatment against augmented trabeculectomy in 
patients presenting with advanced glaucoma in terms of patient-reported health 
and visual function, clinical outcomes and incremental cost per QALY at 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of Advanced Glaucoma Study will be the first RCT 
reporting outcomes from the perspective of those with advanced glaucoma.

Obesity has been estimated to decrease life expectancy by as little as 0.8 to as 
much as 7 years being the second leading cause of preventable death in the 
United States after smoking. Along with the increase in the prevalence of 
obesity, there has been a dramatic rise of the prevalence of prediabetes and 
type 2 diabetes among adolescents. Despite that, very little is known about the 
pathogenesis of these conditions in pediatrics and about how we could detect 
prediabetes in an early stage in order to prevent full blown diabetes. In this 
review we summarize the current knowledge on the pathophysiology of prediabetes 
and type 2 diabetes in adolescents and describe how biomarkers of beta-cell 
function might help identifying those individuals who are prone to progress from 
normal glucose tolerance towards prediabetes and overt type 2 diabetes. To 
better understand and fight this disease, we will need to explore and develop 
novel therapeutic strategies and individuate more sensitive and specific 
biomarkers that can allow an earlier detection of the disease.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to assess the role of socioeconomic 
status (SES) in the associations between type 2 diabetes and life expectancy in 
a complete national population.
METHODS: An observational population-based cohort study was performed using the 
Scottish Care Information - Diabetes database. Age-specific life expectancy 
(stratified by SES) was calculated for all individuals with type 2 diabetes in 
the age range 40-89 during the period 2012-2014, and for the remaining 
population of Scotland aged 40-89 without type 2 diabetes. Differences in life 
expectancy between the two groups were calculated.
RESULTS: Results were based on 272,597 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 2.75 
million people without type 2 diabetes (total for 2013, the middle calendar year 
of the study period). With the exception of deprived men aged 80-89, life 
expectancy in people with type 2 diabetes was significantly reduced (relative to 
the type 2 diabetes-free population) at all ages and levels of SES. Differences 
in life expectancy ranged from -5.5 years (95% CI -6.2, -4.8) for women aged 
40-44 in the second most-deprived quintile of SES, to 0.1 years (95% CI -0.2, 
0.4) for men aged 85-89 in the most-deprived quintile of SES. Observed 
life-expectancy deficits in those with type 2 diabetes were generally greater in 
women than in men.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 2 diabetes is associated with reduced life 
expectancy at almost all ages and levels of SES. Elimination of life-expectancy 
deficits in individuals with type 2 diabetes will require prevention and 
management strategies targeted at all social strata (not just deprived groups).

INTRODUCTION: Prophylactic colon surgery has increased life expectancy of 
familial adenomatous polyposis patients. Extracolonic manifestations are life 
limiting, above all duodenal adenomas. Severe duodenal adenomatosis or cancer 
may necessitate pancreas-preserving total duodenectomy or partial 
pancreatico-duodenectomy, mostly after previous proctocolectomy and often after 
limited local resections of duodenal adenomas. Scarce information on long-term 
postoperative outcome and quality of life after surgery for duodenal 
adenomatosis is available. Aim of the present study was to analyze perioperative 
and long-term outcome after PD and PPTD for FAP-associated duodenal 
adenomatosis, including QoL and recurrence of adenomas in the neoduodenum after 
PPTD.
MATERIAL, METHODS AND PATIENTS: Thirty-eight patients, 27 after 
pancreas-preserving duodenectomy and 11 after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy, 
were included.
RESULTS: Pancreas-preserving total duodenectomy was associated with shorter 
operation time and less blood loss than partial pancreatico-duodenectomy. 
Clinically relevant pancreatic fistula occurred in 31.5%. In-hospital mortality 
was 5.3%. Long-term follow-up revealed recurrent pancreatitis after 
pancreas-preserving total duodenectomy in 22% of patients, two (7.4%) required 
re-operation. Recurrent adenomatosis was detected in 26% of patients. Quality of 
life was comparable to the German normal population after both surgical 
procedures. Patients with postoperative complications showed worse results than 
those without complications. Disease-specific 10-year survival rate with respect 
to duodenal adenomatosis was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Surgery for FAP-associated duodenal adenomatosis and cancer can be 
carried out with reasonable morbidity rates despite previous proctocolectomy. 
Long-term outcome, quality of life, and survival rates are favorable.

OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance of the carotid arteries provides important insight 
into plaque composition and vulnerability in addition to the traditional measure 
of stenosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
MR imaging as a first-line modality to assess carotid disease and guide 
management for high-risk patients with <50% stenosis.
METHODS: Using TreeAge Pro, a cost-effectiveness simulation was conducted 
comparing two strategies: (a) standard of care first-line carotid duplex 
ultrasound (DUS) with regular follow-up, vs (b) first-line MR assessment of 
stenosis and intraplaque haemorrhage (MRIPH) in which patients with IPH received 
annual DUS surveillance and immediate carotid endarterectomy in case of plaque 
progression.
RESULTS: For patients aged 70 years old, using a first-line MRIPH strategy 
resulted in a 16.8% relative risk reduction in strokes compared to DUS (0.080 vs 
0.097 strokes per patient per lifetime), and an increased quality-adjusted-life 
years (12.23 vs 12.20) at an increased cost of $897.33 over a patient's lifetime 
($5784.53 vs $4887.20 average total cost per patient per lifetime). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $29,744 per quality-adjusted-life 
years. MRIPH remained cost-effective below a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$50,000 for 91.8% of sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: MRIPH was found to be a cost-effective first-line tool to identify 
asymptomatic patients at high risk for stroke requiring annual surveillance and 
prompt management. Advances in Knowledge: Using MR imaging as a fist-line method 
to detect the presence of IPH provides clinically useful and cost-effective 
information that allows for enhanced risk evaluation and primary stroke 
prevention.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in melanoma is affected by 
cancer stage. Previous studies have reported limited data on utility-based 
HRQOL.
OBJECTIVES: To determine pooled estimates of utility-based HRQOL (utilities) for 
people with American Joint Cancer Committee stage I/II, III or IV melanoma for 
use in economic evaluations.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review, meta-analysis and metaregression of 
utilities for patients with melanoma. HRQOL scores reported with the QLQ-C30, 
SF-36, SF-12, FACT-G and FACT-M instruments were converted to utilities using 
published mapping algorithms. Meta-analysis was used to calculate mean 
utilities. Metaregression was used to examine the effects of baseline patient 
and study characteristics.
RESULTS: We identified 33 studies reporting 213 utilities. From meta-analyses, 
the mean utility for stage I/II melanoma was 0·97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
0·90-0·98]; for stage III melanoma it was 0·77 (95% CI 0·70-0·83); for stage 
III/IV 0·76 (95% CI 0·76-0·77); and for stage IV melanoma 0·76 (95% CI 
0·71-0·81). The difference in utility between stage III and stage IV was not 
statistically significant (P = 0·52). For patients with stage I/II, the utility 
estimate at the time of surgery was 0·77 (95% CI 0·75-0·79), and at 3-12 months 
postsurgery it was 0·85 (95% CI 0·84-0·86). Utility estimates for patients with 
stage IV melanoma were 0·65 (95% CI 0·62-0·69) during the first 3 months of 
treatment and 0·83 (95% CI 0·81-0·86) at 4-12 months on treatment. For patients 
with stage IV melanoma treated with chemotherapy, the utility estimate was 0·52 
(95% CI 0·51-0·52), while for those treated with targeted therapy it was 0·83 
(95% CI 0·82-0·85).
CONCLUSIONS: These robust, evidence-based estimates of health state utility can 
be used in economic evaluations of new treatments for patients with early-stage 
or advanced-stage melanoma.

Mechanisms Involved in Premature Aging in the Heart-Is There an Implication for 
Cardiac Surgery?

During the past century, life expectancy has risen in Germany from 35.6 and 38.5 
years in men and women (1871/1881) to 78.2 and 83.1 years (2013/2015). In recent 
years, the dominance of chronic diseases as major contributors to total global 
mortality has emerged. The incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) increases 
in westernized societies and projected trends suggest that by 2030, CVD alone 
will also be responsible for more deaths in low-income countries than infectious 
diseases. The occurrence of CVD also seems to correlate to a further increase of 
biological age within westernized societies. Therefore, age-associated changes 
in the heart are an issue of high interest in cardiac surgery. The chronological 
age is a prognostic marker in some clinical scoring systems. However, it does 
not represent an adequate estimation of the biological age of patients or their 
perioperative risk. In fact, frailty might be a more powerful predictor for 
normal perioperative course or risk escalation. An unhealthy, sedentary 
lifestyle can induce premature aging of vessels and myocardium. Understanding 
the age-associated genetic, biochemical, and pathophysiological changes can help 
identify the therapeutic capability of aged myocardium. Future "therapeutic 
myocardial rejuvenation" may represent a powerful tool for the stabilization of 
the perioperative course in aged patients. In this review, we will focus on 
selected mediators or conditions with impact on age-associated myocardial 
changes with a major focus on obesity and discuss potential therapeutic 
strategies to utilize or modify these mediators.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report the 10-year outcomes of the 
multicenter Italian Excluder Registry for elective endovascular aneurysm repair 
(EVAR).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent elective EVAR 
using the Gore Excluder (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) endograft 
(EG) at four Italian centers between 1998 and 2006 was carried out. Follow-up 
consisted of duplex ultrasound scan and computed tomography performed at 
1 month, 6 months, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. Long-term outcomes were 
evaluated according to a life-table analysis.
RESULTS: The Excluder EG was used in 461 patients (425 men; mean age, 72.9 ± 
9.2 years) with abdominal aortic aneurysm (mean diameter, 52.2 ± 11.9 mm) who 
underwent elective EVAR. The 10-year cumulative survival was 62.5% ± 3.5% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 55.5%-69.1%). During the follow-up, 14 (3.03%) 
patients were lost to follow-up. Estimated freedom from EG-related complication 
was 90.5% ± 1.5% (95% CI, 87.4%-92.9%) at 5 years, 89.2% ± 1.6% (95% CI, 
85.6%-91.9%) at 7 years, and 88.4% ± 1.8% (95% CI, 84.4%-91.5%) at 10 years. 
Freedom from reintervention at 5, 7, and 10 years was 87.7% ± 1.8% (95% CI, 
83.7%-90.8%), 82.4% ± 2.4% (95% CI, 77.2%-86.6%), and 80.6% ± 2.6% (95% CI, 
75.5%-84.9%), respectively. On multivariable analysis, we did not find 
independent predictors of a higher rate of reintervention. There were 127 
(27.5%) endoleaks detected during the follow-up. Only one type I endoleak was 
identified beyond 5-year follow-up. Cumulative freedom from endoleak rate was 
significantly different between the two different follow-up intervals 
(0-5 years, 2.6%; 6-10 years, 0.8%; P < .001). Estimated freedom from 
aorta-related mortality was 97.2% ± 0.8% (95% CI, 49.7%-99.9%) at 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The Italian Excluder Registry outcomes confirmed sustained EVAR 
effectiveness at 10-year follow-up using the Gore Excluder EG. Freedom from 
EG-related complications, endoleaks, and reinterventions was satisfactory and 
remained acceptable beyond 5 years of follow-up, supporting a reasonable 
long-term durability of this device.

The cost-effectiveness of different mass dog rabies vaccination strategies, 
defined as the costs per year of life lost (YLL) averted was evaluated for a 
period of 10 years by means of a dynamic simulation study for a typical village 
on Flores Island. In the base strategy (no dog vaccination and no post-exposure 
treatment (PET) of human bite cases), the model showed that the introduction of 
the virus by one infectious dog into an isolated village with 1500 inhabitants 
and 400 dogs resulted in 881 YLLs during a 10-year simulation period, which is 
equivalent to 30 human rabies cases. An annual dog vaccination campaign with a 
coverage of 70% using a short-acting vaccine saved 832 YLLs, while the 
cumulative costs for the public sector were US$3646 or US$4.38 per YLL averted. 
Switching to a long-acting vaccine, the annual vaccination strategies with a 
coverage of 50% (AV_156_50) or 70% (AV_156_70) reduced the baseline YLLs from 
881 to respectively 78 and 26 YLLs with cumulative costs of US$3716 and US$2264 
or US$4.63 and US$2.65 per YLL averted, respectively. In general, dog 
vaccination was more cost-effective than PET alone (US$2.65-4.63 per YLL averted 
versus US$23.29 per YLL averted). Although a combination of PET with AV_156_70 
was less cost-effective compared to AV_156_70 alone, this strategy was able to 
prevent all human deaths due to rabies. A combination of PET with annual 
vaccination using a short-acting vaccine at a coverage of 50% was far from being 
cost-effective, suggesting that the currently applied rabies control in Flores 
Island is not an efficient investment in reducing human rabies burden. An 
increased investment in either an increase in the current coverage or in a 
switch from the short-acting vaccine to the long-acting vaccine type would 
certainly pay off.

BACKGROUND: Many countries struggle with the prioritisation of introducing new 
vaccines because of budget limitations and lack of focus on public health goals. 
A model has been developed that defines how specific health goals can be 
optimised through immunisation within vaccination budget constraints.
METHODS: Japan, as a country example, could introduce 4 new pediatric vaccines 
targeting influenza, rotavirus, pneumococcal disease and mumps with known burden 
of disease, vaccine efficacies and maximum achievable coverages. Operating under 
budget constraints, the Portfolio-model for the Management of Vaccines (PMV) 
identifies the optimal vaccine ranking and combination for achieving the maximum 
QALY gain over a period of 10 calendar years in children <5 years old. This 
vaccine strategy, of interest and helpful for a healthcare decision maker, is 
compared with an unranked vaccine selection process.
RESULTS: Results indicate that the maximum QALY gain with a fixed annual 
vaccination budget of 500 billion Japanese Yen over a 10-year period is 72,288 
QALYs using the optimal sequence of vaccine introduction (mumps [1st], followed 
by influenza [2nd], rotavirus [3rd], and pneumococcal [4th]). With exactly the 
same budget but without vaccine ranking, the total QALY gain can be 20% lower.
CONCLUSION: The PMV model could be a helpful tool for decision makers in those 
environments with limited budget where vaccines have to be selected for trying 
to optimise specific health goals.

The role of flavonoids in the survival machinery of cells has come in the 
spotlight due to the recent evidence of their effect on the relationship 
mitochondria-ER stress-proteasome, including the intracellular mechanisms of 
autophagy and apoptosis. Numerous experimental animal investigations and even 
human clinical studies have highlighted the major role of these natural 
compounds in the economy of life and their deep relationship with autotrophic 
organisms in the evolutionary space. Their role as anti-oxidant and oxidative 
stress preventive molecules has to date been investigated extensively in the 
literature. Despite this great amount of promising evidence, many concerns, 
however, remain, most of which dealing with biochemistry, bioavailability, 
pharmacokinetics, and interaction of flavonoids with gut microbiome, issues that 
make difficult any good attempt to introduce these molecules in the human 
healthcare systems as possible, encouraging therapeutic substances. This review 
tries to address and elucidate these items.

In the Global Burden of Disease study, disease burden is measured as 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The paramount assumption of the DALY is 
that it makes sense to aggregate years lived with disability (YLDs) and years of 
life lost (YLLs). However, this is not smooth sailing. Whereas morbidity (YLD) 
is something that happens to an individual, loss of life itself (YLL) occurs 
when that individual's life has ended. YLLs quantify something that involves no 
experience and does not take place among living individuals. This casts doubt on 
whether the YLL is an individual burden at all. If not, then YLDs and YLLs are 
incommensurable. There are at least three responses to this problem, only one of 
which is tenable: a counterfactual account of harm. Taking this strategy 
necessitates a re-examination of how we count YLLs, particularly at the 
beginning of life.

Life-extending enhancements and the narrative approach to personal identity.

Sauchelli A.

Various debates on the desirability and rationality of life-extending 
enhancements have been pursued under the presupposition that a generic 
psychological theory of personal identity is correct. I here discuss how the 
narrative approach to personal identity can contribute to these debates. In 
particular, I argue that two versions of the narrative approach offer good 
reasons to reject an argument against the rationality of (certain forms of) 
life-extending enhancements.

Cost-effectiveness of the faecal immunochemical test at a range of positivity 
thresholds compared with the guaiac faecal occult blood test in the NHS Bowel 
Cancer Screening Programme in England.

OBJECTIVES: Through the National Health Service (NHS) Bowel Cancer Screening 
Programme (BCSP), men and women in England aged between 60 and 74 years are 
invited for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening every 2 years using the guaiac 
faecal occult blood test (gFOBT). The aim of this analysis was to estimate the 
cost-utility of the faecal immunochemical test for haemoglobin (FIT) compared 
with gFOBT for a cohort beginning screening aged 60 years at a range of FIT 
positivity thresholds.
DESIGN: We constructed a cohort-based Markov state transition model of CRC 
disease progression and screening. Screening uptake, detection, adverse event, 
mortality and cost data were taken from BCSP data and national sources, 
including a recent large pilot study of FIT screening in the BCSP.
RESULTS: Our results suggest that FIT is cost-effective compared with gFOBT at 
all thresholds, resulting in cost savings and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained over a lifetime time horizon. FIT was cost-saving (p<0.001) and 
resulted in QALY gains of 0.014 (95% CI 0.012 to 0.017) at the base case 
threshold of 180 µg Hb/g faeces. Greater health gains and cost savings were 
achieved as the FIT threshold was decreased due to savings in cancer management 
costs. However, at lower thresholds, FIT was also associated with more 
colonoscopies (increasing from 32 additional colonoscopies per 1000 people 
invited for screening for FIT 180 µg Hb/g faeces to 421 additional colonoscopies 
per 1000 people invited for screening for FIT 20 µg Hb/g faeces over a 40-year 
time horizon). Parameter uncertainty had limited impact on the conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published economic analysis of FIT screening in 
England using data directly comparing FIT with gFOBT in the NHS BSCP. These 
results for a cohort starting screening aged 60 years suggest that FIT is highly 
cost-effective at all thresholds considered. Further modelling is needed to 
estimate economic outcomes for screening across all age cohorts simultaneously.

[Urodynamic studies prior to urinary incontinence surgery : What is useful?].

Surgery is often necessary after failure of conservative therapy for urinary 
incontinence. Guidelines recommend urodynamic studies before surgery. A 
distinction is made between non-invasive (uroflowmetry) and invasive methods 
(cystometry and pressure-flow study, if necessary as combined videourodynamics, 
as well as urethral pressure profile). All examinations serve to objectify and 
quantify the symptoms, to correctly assign symptoms to the pathophysiology and 
anatomy as well as to identify risk factors, which often have a significant 
influence on the success of surgical therapy. Given appropriate experience, 
complications and often significant sequelae of bladder dysfunction affecting 
the patient's quality of life and life expectancy can be recognized. Urodynamic 
studies are performed to help narrow down potential diagnoses, to develop 
therapeutic strategies, and to obtain prognostic parameters. The following 
article is intended to provide some support.

PURPOSE AND HYPOTHESIS: Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy is characterized by a 
proliferation of small vessels, called neovascularization, which can be 
demonstrated by power Doppler sonography (PD). Neovascularization can be 
correlated with diagnosis and consequent therapies focused on vascular supply. 
Published data regarding the relationship between neovascularisation and 
symptoms, such as pain and disability, are contradictory. The hypothesis that 
contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) could detect with more sensibility than PD 
the new vessel ingrowth in human degenerated Achilles tendons and therefore the 
correlation of neovascularization with pain and disability, was evaluated.
METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients of recalcitrant Achilles tendinopathy were 
studied with ultrasound greyscale (US), PD, CEUS and magnetic resonance imaging. 
Neovascularization was recorded as percentage on the whole extension of examined 
area. The vascularization time was recorded as venous and arterial type. Imaging 
data were classified both concurrently with the examination and in a secondary 
blinded assessment; any difference in the subjective assessment was discussed 
and a consensus view formed. Pain and disability were assessed by Western 
Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and EuroQuality of life 
5-dimension-5-level questionnaire and visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). All 
results were analysed with suitable statistical methods.
RESULTS: 76.7% of cases were degenerated; 23.3% had also partial discontinuity 
of the fibres. PD detected vascularization in 54% of cases, whereas CEUS in 83% 
of cases: in 13 cases, PD did not detect vascularization. The vascularization 
time was rapid (< 20 s, arterial type) in 60% of cases. WOMAC pain mean value is 
6.4 and SD 3.4; WOMAC total score mean value is 21.6 and SD 12.8. EQ-VAS mean 
value is 56 and SD 18.3. No statistically significant correlation emerged 
between vascularization and pain/disability.
CONCLUSIONS: CEUS showed a greater ability to detect neovessels than PD in 
chronic Achilles tendinopathies. Nevertheless in 30 consecutive tendinopathies, 
no correlation between pain/disability and neovascularization was found: the 
role of multiple neovessels continue to be unclear. The possibility to 
discriminate arterial from venous vessels ('vascularization time') could be 
useful to understand the pathophysiology of tendinopathies and its healing 
process.
STUDY TYPE: Diagnostic study.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost 
effectiveness of exenatide once weekly (ExQW) versus insulin glargine (IG) or 
liraglutide 1.2 mg (Lira1.2mg) for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drug 
(OAD) therapy in Greece.
METHODS: The published and validated Cardiff Diabetes Model was used to project 
clinical and economic outcomes over a patient's lifetime. Clinical data were 
retrieved from a head-to-head clinical trial (DURATION 3) and a published 
network meta-analysis comparing ExQW with IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively. 
Following a Greek third-party payer perspective, direct medical costs related to 
drug acquisition, consumables, developed micro- and macrovascular complications, 
maintenance treatment, as well as treatment-related adverse events were 
considered. Cost and utility data were extracted from literature and publicly 
available official sources and assigned to model parameters to calculate total 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total costs as well as incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of 
changes in input data.
RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, ExQW was associated with 0.458 or 0.039 
incremental QALYs compared with IG or Lira1.2mg, respectively, at additional 
costs of €2061 or €110, respectively. The ICER for ExQW was €4499/QALY compared 
with IG and €2827/QALY compared with Lira1.2mg. Results were robust across 
various one-way and scenario analyses. At the defined willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €36,000/QALY, probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that ExQW 
had a 100 or 88.2% probability of being cost effective relative to IG or 
Lira1.2mg, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: ExQW was estimated to be cost effective relative to IG or Lira1.2mg 
for the treatment of T2DM in adults not adequately controlled on OAD therapy in 
Greece.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central 
nervous system, whose incidental peak occurs around 30 years. This review 
focuses on epidemiologic, physiopathological, clinical and therapeutic 
characteristics of MS in elderly patients in two different situations: 1) 
late-onset MS (after 50 years), 2) aging in MS with young adult-onset. 
Epidemiologic studies established that MS occurs after 50 years in 5% of cases. 
As opposed to young adult-onset MS, late-onset MS is characterized by a 
predominant progressive course, a longer diagnosis delay, a higher prevalence of 
motor disability, while cognitive impairment is similar in terms of frequency 
and affected cognitive domains. Improvement of MS patients' global healthcare 
together with life expectancy increase has led to an increased number of elderly 
patients with MS, regardless of age at onset. Care providers must take into 
account the potential more frequent comorbidities in this specific population 
and pharmacological differences with younger subjects to adapt and optimize the 
risk/balance benefit of disease-modifying therapies.

BACKGROUND: Diagnostic research criteria for Alzheimer's disease support the use 
of biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to improve the accuracy of the 
prognosis regarding progression to dementia for people with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the potential incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of adding CSF biomarker testing to the standard 
diagnostic workup to determine the prognosis for patients with MCI.
METHODS: In an early technology assessment, a mathematical simulation model was 
built, using available evidence on added prognostic value as well as expert 
opinion to estimate the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) of 20,000 virtual MCI patients with (intervention strategy) and without 
(control strategy) relying on CSF, from a health-care sector perspective and 
with a 5-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Adding the CSF test improved the accuracy of prognosis by 11%. This 
resulted in an average QALY gain of 0.046 and € 432 additional costs per 
patient, representing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of € 9,416.
CONCLUSION: The results show the potential of CSF biomarkers in current practice 
from a health-economics perspective. This result was, however, marked by a high 
degree of uncertainty, and empirical research is required into the impact of a 
prognosis on worrying, false-positive/negative prognosis, and stigmatization.

The cognitive effect of Artemisia argyi H. under liquid-state fermentation by 
Monascus purpureus (AAFM), which has cellular antioxidant activity and neuronal 
cell viability, on trimethyltin- (TMT-) induced learning and memory impairment 
in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice was confirmed. Tests were conducted 
to determine the neuroprotective effects against H2O2-induced oxidative stress, 
and the results showed that AAFM has protective effects through the repression 
of mitochondrial injury and cellular membrane damage against H2O2-induced 
neurotoxicity. In animal experiments, such as the Y-maze, passive avoidance, and 
Morris water maze tests, AAFM also showed excellent ameliorating effects on 
TMT-induced cognitive dysfunction. After behavioral tests, brain tissues were 
extracted to assess damage to brain tissue. According to the experimental 
results, AAFM improved the cholinergic system by upregulating acetylcholine 
(ACh) contents and inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. AAFM 
effectively improved the decline of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) level and the 
increase of the oxidized glutathione (GSH) ratio and lipid peroxidation 
(malondialdehyde (MDA) production) caused by TMT-induced oxidative stress. The 
occurrence of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis was also decreased 
compared with the TMT group. Finally, quinic acid derivatives were identified as 
the major phenolic compounds in AAFM using ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight (UPLC-Q-TOF) MS analysis.
