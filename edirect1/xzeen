BACKGROUND: Gene therapy is a potential cure for sickle cell disease (SCD). 
Conventional cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) does not capture the effects of 
treatments on disparities in SCD, but distributional CEA (DCEA) uses equity 
weights to incorporate these considerations.
OBJECTIVE: To compare gene therapy versus standard of care (SOC) in patients 
with SCD by using conventional CEA and DCEA.
DESIGN: Markov model.
DATA SOURCES: Claims data and other published sources.
TARGET POPULATION: Birth cohort of patients with SCD.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: U.S. health system.
INTERVENTION: Gene therapy at age 12 years versus SOC.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (in dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] gained) and threshold inequality aversion 
parameter (equity weight).
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Gene therapy versus SOC for females yielded 25.5 
versus 15.7 (males: 24.4 vs. 15.5) discounted lifetime QALYs at costs of $2.8 
million and $1.0 million (males: $2.8 million and $1.2 million), respectively, 
with an ICER of $176 000 per QALY (full SCD population). The inequality aversion 
parameter would need to be 0.90 for the full SCD population for gene therapy to 
be preferred per DCEA standards.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: SOC was favored in 100.0% (females) and 87.1% 
(males) of 10 000 probabilistic iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100 000 per QALY. Gene therapy would need to cost less than $1.79 million to 
meet conventional CEA standards.
LIMITATION: Benchmark equity weights (as opposed to SCD-specific weights) were 
used to interpret DCEA results.
CONCLUSION: Gene therapy is cost-ineffective per conventional CEA standards but 
can be an equitable therapeutic strategy for persons living with SCD in the 
United States per DCEA standards.

BACKGROUND: Limb weakness is a major impairment that affects mobility in persons 
with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Specifically, lower limb (LL) weakness can 
greatly affect gait and balance, while increasing fall risk and decreasing 
quality of life. Numerous studies have compared LL strength of PwMS to healthy 
controls, however none have objectively measured strength in all major LL joints 
(hip, knee, and ankle) in a large number of PwMS. Additionally, while discrete 
normative values exist for knee extensors in PwMS, there has yet to be 
regression-based normative isometric strength values for all major LL muscle 
groups. Therefore, this study aimed to develop gender-specific regression-based 
normative prediction equations, with 95% confidence intervals, for maximal 
isometric peak torque of major LL muscles in PwMS. A secondary aim was to 
characterize the prevalence of LL weakness in PwMS, defined as ≥ 2 SD below 
values reported for healthy individuals.
METHODS: A convenience sample of 175 (women: n = 135) PwMS participated in a 
prospective, cross-sectional study where isometric peak torque of hip flexors, 
extensors, and abductors, knee flexors and extensors, and ankle plantarflexors 
and dorsiflexors were measured using the Biodex System 4 Pro-Dynamometer®. 
Demographics (age, height, and weight) and disease characteristics (disease 
duration and disability) were collected. Performances were separated for each 
muscle group into strongest limb and weakest limb. For each gender, 
regression-based equations were generated for the LL muscle groups by limb with 
age, height, weight, disability, and disease duration as the covariates. 
Descriptive statistics were used to examine the frequency of LL weakness by 
gender and disability level. For comparison purposes, age-stratified (<30, 
30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, >70 years) and disability-stratified (mild, 
moderate, and severe ambulant) discrete peak torque values were also generated 
for each gender.
RESULTS: Regression-based normative data are presented for men and women, 
accounting for age, height, weight, disability, and disease duration. Men were 
significantly stronger (P < 0.001) than women for all LL, with the men's models 
accounting for a greater percent of muscle strength variation than women's 
models for all muscle groups, except for hip extension. Disability was inversely 
related to strength in all of the models. LL weakness was prevalent in hip 
flexion (m: 47.5%; w: 63.0%) and extension (m: 92.5%; w: 88.1%), knee extension 
(m: 30.0%; w: 33.3%) and flexion (m: 25.0%; w: 34.8%), and ankle plantarflexion 
(m: 15.0%; w: 10.4%) and dorsiflexion (m: 100.0%; w: 96.3%). PwMS with mild 
disability had a high prevalence of ankle dorsiflexion (94.9-100.0%) and hip 
extension (81.4-90.0%) weakness.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide regression-based normative data 
of bilateral strength in all major LL muscle groups and clinically useful 
prevalence data on the occurrence of weakness in these muscles. Of note, PwMS 
had a high prevalence of ankle dorsiflexion and hip extension weakness even when 
they were only mildly disabled. These findings can help guide the direction of 
future interventions and treatments to improve muscle function in PwMS.

As a natural polyphenol, curcumin has been used as an alternative to synthetic 
preservatives in food preservation. Different from previous reviews that mainly 
focus on the pH-responsive discoloration of curcumin to detect changes in food 
quality in real time, this paper focuses on the perspective of the delivery 
system and photosensitization of curcumin for food preservation. The delivery 
system is an effective means to overcome the challenges of curcumin like 
instability, hydrophobicity, and low bioavailability. Curcumin as a 
photosensitizer can effectively sterilize to preserve food. The practical 
fresh-keeping effects of the delivery system and photosensitization of curcumin 
on foods (fruits/vegetables, animal-derived food, and grain) were summarized 
comprehensively, including shelf-life extension, maintenance of physicochemical 
properties, nutritional quality, and sensory. Future research should focus on 
the development of novel curcumin-loaded materials used for food preservation, 
and most importantly, the biosafety and accumulation toxicity associated with 
these materials should be explored.

The nonenzymatic copying of RNA is thought to have been necessary for the 
transition between prebiotic chemistry and ribozyme-catalyzed RNA replication in 
the RNA World. We have previously shown that a potentially prebiotic nucleotide 
activation pathway based on phospho-Passerini chemistry can lead to the 
efficient synthesis of 2-aminoimidazole activated mononucleotides when carried 
out under freeze-thaw cycling conditions. Such activated nucleotides react with 
each other to form 5'-5' 2-aminoimidazolium bridged dinucleotides, enabling 
template-directed primer extension to occur within the same reaction mixture. 
However, mononucleotides linked to oligonucleotides by a 5'-5' 
2-aminoimidazolium bridge are superior substrates for nonenzymatic primer 
extension; their higher intrinsic reactivity and their higher template affinity 
enable faster template copying at lower substrate concentrations. Here we show 
that eutectic phase phospho-Passerini chemistry efficiently activates short 
oligonucleotides and promotes the formation of monomer-bridged-oligonucleotide 
species during freeze-thaw cycles. We then demonstrate that in-situ generated 
monomer-bridged-oligonucleotides lead to efficient nonenzymatic template copying 
in the same reaction mixture. Our demonstration that multiple steps in the 
pathway from activation chemistry to RNA copying can occur together in a single 
complex environment simplifies this aspect of the origin of life.

Plain Language Summary: The absence of a prebiotically plausible pathway for the 
efficient nonenzymatic copying of RNAs remains a major obstacle towards 
constructing self-replicating protocells that emulate early lifeforms. We 
demonstrate the activation of short oligonucleotides and the subsequent 
formation of monomer-bridged-oligonucleotide species, leading to efficient 
nonenzymatic template copying in the same reaction mixture. Our findings suggest 
that in-situ activated mixtures of mono- and oligo-nucleotides would 
significantly outperform mononucleotides in driving the copying of arbitrary RNA 
sequences. Our demonstration that multiple steps in the pathway from activation 
chemistry to RNA copying can occur together in a single complex environment 
simplifies this aspect of the origin of life.

Facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a common muscular dystrophy featuring 
progressive weakness, mostly involving facial muscles and the scapular cingulum. 
FSHD is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease driven by the contraction of the 
D4Z4 region of chromosome 4. Patients with FSHD have a high life expectancy, 
about 20% of FSHD subjects need wheelchairs in their 50s, and extramuscular 
involvement is rare, however, no epidemiological studies have been carried out 
on this data.Our case describes a man affected by FSHD who, in his 60s, 
developed atypical Parkinsonism diagnosed as progressive supranuclear palsy 
(PSP).FSHD symptoms can hide other neuromuscular diseases developed on ageing. 
This case highlights the importance of considering possible overlaps with other 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Objective: To analyze the burden of disease attributable to high temperature 
exposure in China and globally from 1990 to 2019, and to study the current 
burden of disease in relevant populations. Methods: In October 2021, based on 
data from the global burden of disease 2019 (GBD 2019) study, population 
attributable fraction (PAF), number of deaths, mortality, disability-adjusted 
life year (DALY) and DALY rate of Chinese and global populations with different 
ages and genders in 1990 and 2019 were extracted and analyzed. The rate of 
change was calculated, the mortality rate was normalized by the age structure of 
the world standard population, and the causes of disease burden caused by high 
temperature exposure of Chinese residents were analyzed. Results: In 2019, 
compared with 1990, the PAF of Chinese and global population decreased by 43.98% 
and 12.41% respectively, the number of deaths increased by 29.55% and 49.40% 
respectively, the crude mortality rate increased by 7.81% and 3.30% 
respectively, the DALY decreased by 48.12% and 14.41% respectively, and the DALY 
rate decreased by 56.82% and 40.82% respectively. The mortality rate of the ≥70 
age group was higher than that of other groups. The disease burden indicators 
such as PAF, standardized mortality and DALY attributable to high temperature 
exposure in men were higher than those in women. In 2019, the main cause of DALY 
affected by high temperature exposure in Chinese population was ischemic heart 
disease (84400 person-years), and the main cause of death was ischemic heart 
disease (4900 cases). Conclusion: The burden of diseases attributable to high 
temperature exposure is still serious in China and the world at large. Targeted 
interventions should be formulated for men, the elderly and people with 
occupational exposure, and a sound surveillance system should be established to 
reduce the burden of diseases caused by high temperature exposure.

The swimming crab, Portunus trituberculatus, is one of the main aquaculture 
species in Chinese coastal regions due to its palatability and high economic 
value. To obtain a better understanding of the genetic diversity of P. 
trituberculatus in the Bohai Sea, the present study used 40 SSR loci to 
investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of 420 P. 
trituberculatus individuals collected from seven populations in the Bohai Sea. 
Genetic parameters revealed a low level of genetic diversity in the cultured 
population (SI = 1.374, He = 0.687, and PIC = 0.643) in comparison with wild 
populations (SI ≥ 1.399, He ≥ 0.692, and PIC ≥ 0.651). The genetic 
differentiation index (Fst) and gene flow (Nm) ranged from 0.001 to 0.060 (mean: 
0.022) and 3.917 to 249.750 (mean: 31.289) respectively, showing a low 
differentiation among the seven populations of P. trituberculatus. Population 
structure analysis, phylogenetic tree, and principal component analysis (PCA) 
demonstrated that the seven groups of P. trituberculatus were divided into four 
subpopulations (K = 4), but the correlation between genetic structure and 
geographical distribution was not obvious. These results are expected to provide 
useful information for the fishery management of wild swimming crabs.

Talking about osteoporosis, we tend to focus on post-menopause women who are at 
increased risk due to estrogen depletion, while less attention has been paid to 
the disease in men. Currently, there is a lack of understanding about the 
difference of osteoporosis incidence and burden by sex. In this study, we used 
data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019) to compare the 
difference in the prevalence and burden of low bone mineral density (LBMD) 
between men and women, by location, year, age and socio-demographic index. We 
found the prevalence of LBMD was higher in women than in men. However, the age 
standardized mortality rate was greatly higher in men than in women. Using 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) to measure the burden, we also observed 
higher age standardized DALY rate in men. Using sociodemographic index (SDI) as 
the measure of social development level, we found that higher mortality and DALY 
rates were mainly seen in middle and high SDI countries. Falls were the leading 
cause for of deaths and disabilities in both men and women with LBMD, followed 
by transport injuries. Fall-related mortality was higher in women, while 
transport injuries caused more deaths and disabilities in men. Conclusively, 
more attention should be paid to osteoporosis in men, and related policies, 
clinical practices, and guidelines are in need to reduce the burden of LBMD and 
osteoporosis in men.

BACKGROUND: Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) is a rare autosomal recessive 
disorder characterized primarily by an inability to perceive physical pain from 
birth, resulting in the accumulation of bruising, inflammation, and fractures 
that affect patient's life expectancy. CIP has different forms including CIP and 
CIPA. CIP with Anhidrosis (CIPA) is the most common type of CIP, which is caused 
mainly by mutations in NTRK1 and NGF genes, and is characterized by mental 
retardation and the inability to sweat (Anhidrosis). Because of high 
consanguinity rates in Palestine, this rare disease appears to have a higher 
frequency than in other communities. However, there were no systematic studies 
to address the genetic factors that cause CIP in the Palestinian community.
METHODS: In our study, we used Sanger and Whole exome sequencing to genotype 
members of five CIP-affected Palestinian families.
RESULTS: Our results confirm the presence of the founder c.1860-1861insT 
mutation in the NTRK1 gene of Palestinian Bedouin CIPA patients. Furthermore, 
one CIPA family carried a missense c.2170 G > A (G724 S) mutation in exon 16 of 
the NTRK1 gene. Finally, a novel nonsense c.901 A > T mutation (K301*) was 
detected in exon 7 of the SCN9A gene in CIP without anhidrosis family.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed three mutations that cause CIP and CIPA in the 
Palestinian community, which can help in improving the process of diagnosis and 
genetic counseling and establishing protocols for the diagnosis and follow-up 
for the affected individuals. This is especially important given that early 
diagnosis and medical care interference can prevent unpleasant CIP and CIPA 
complications.

Ageing is a multi-factorial phenomenon which is considered as a major risk 
factor for the development of neurodegeneration, osteoporosis, cardiovascular 
disease, dementia, cancer, and other chronic diseases. Phenotypically, ageing is 
related with a combination of molecular, cellular, and physiological levels like 
genomic and epi-genomic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulation of 
cellular and subcellular function and mitochondrial dysfunction. Though, no 
single molecular mechanism accounts for the functional decline of different 
organ systems in older humans but accumulation of DNA damage or mutations is a 
dominant theory which contributes largely to the development of ageing and 
age-related diseases. However, mechanistic, and hierarchical order of these 
features of ageing has not been clarified yet. Scientific community now focus on 
the effect of obesity on accelerated ageing process. Obesity is a complex 
chronic disease that affects multiple organs and tissues. It can not only lead 
to various health conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular 
disease but also can decrease life expectancy which shows similar phenotype of 
ageing. Higher loads of DNA damage were also observed in the genome of obese 
people. Thus, inability of DNA damage repair may contribute to both ageing and 
obesity apart from cancer predisposition. The present review emphasizes on the 
involvement of molecular phenomenon of DNA metabolism in development of obesity 
and how it accelerates ageing in mammals.

Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several widely used medications, with a relevant efficacy 
profile, are toxic to the peripheral nervous system and an even larger number of 
agents are suspected to be neurotoxic. There are concerns about the use of these 
drugs in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary motor and 
sensory neuropathy. This review provides evidence-based updated recommendations 
on this clinically relevant topic.
METHODS: A systematic review of the available studies/reports written in English 
was performed from July to September 2022 including in the search string all 
reported putative neurotoxic drugs.
RESULTS: The results of our systematic review provide evidence-based support for 
the statement that use of vincristine, and possibly paclitaxel, can occasionally 
induce an atypical, and more severe, course of drug-related peripheral 
neurotoxicity in CMT patients. It is therefore reasonable to recommend caution 
in the use of these compounds in CMT patients. However, no convincing evidence 
for a similar recommendation could be found for all other drugs.
INTERPRETATION: It is important that patients with CMT are not denied effective 
treatments that may prolong life expectancy for cancer or improve their health 
status if affected by non-oncological diseases. Accurate monitoring of 
peripheral nerve function in CMT patients treated with any neurotoxic agent 
remains mandatory to detect the earliest signs of neuropathy worsening and 
atypical clinical courses. Neurologists monitoring CMT patients as part of their 
normal care package or for natural history studies should keep detailed records 
of exposures to neurotoxic medications and support reporting of accelerated 
neuropathy progression if observed.

Oral cancer is the most debilitating disease which affects the orderly life of a 
human. With so much advancement in research and technology, the average life 
expectancy of an individual with oral cancer appears to be about 5 years. The 
changing trend in incidence of oral cancer among young individuals and women 
without tobacco habits are ascending. Non habit related oral cancer are taking 
centre stage and multiple factors which induce complex biology are associated in 
such scenarios. To decipher the aetiology and to understand the process, these 
cancerous conditions are to be studied at molecular level. Saliva, the most 
non-invasively obtained body fluid are assessed for biomarkers exclusively in 
liquid biopsy. This fluid gives a huge platform to study number of molecules 
associated with oral cancer. Non coding RNAs are transcripts with no protein 
coding function. They are gaining more importance in recent times. Long 
noncoding RNA, microRNA are major types of noncoding transcriptome that 
influences in progression of oral cancer. They seem to play an important role in 
health and disease. Apart from these, circulating tumour cells, exosomes, 
extracellular vesicles, antigens and other proteins can be studied from saliva. 
This review is aimed to update the knowledge on current biomarkers in saliva 
associated with oral cancer and their epigenetic role in disease progression as 
well recent advances in detecting these markers to identify the stage of the 
disease, which will help in deciding the treatment protocol.

INTRODUCTION: Rehabilitation approaches take advantage of vision's important 
role in kinesthesia, using the mirror paradigm as a means to reduce phantom limb 
pain or to promote recovery from hemiparesis. Notably, it is currently applied 
to provide a visual reafferentation of the missing limb to relieve amputees' 
pain. However, the efficiency of this method is still debated, possibly due to 
the absence of concomitant coherent proprioceptive feedback. We know that 
combining congruent visuo-proprioceptive signals at the hand level enhances 
movement perception in healthy people. However, much less is known about lower 
limbs, for which actions are far less visually controlled in everyday life than 
upper limbs. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore, with the mirror 
paradigm, the benefit of combined visuo-proprioceptive feedback from the lower 
limbs of healthy participants.
METHODS: We compared the movement illusions driven by visual or proprioceptive 
afferents and tested the extent to which adding proprioceptive input to the 
visual reflection of the leg improved the resulting movement illusion. To this 
end, 23 healthy adults were exposed to mirror or proprioceptive stimulation and 
concomitant visuo-proprioceptive stimulation. In the visual conditions, 
participants were asked to voluntarily move their left leg in extension and look 
at its reflection in the mirror. In the proprioceptive conditions, a mechanical 
vibration was applied to the hamstring muscle of the leg hidden behind the 
mirror to simulate an extension of the leg, either exclusively or concomitantly, 
to the visual reflection of the leg in the mirror.
RESULTS: (i) Visual stimulation evoked leg movement illusions but with a lower 
velocity than the actual movement reflection on the mirror; (ii) proprioceptive 
stimulation alone provided more salient illusions than the mirror illusion; and 
(iii) adding a congruent proprioceptive stimulation improved the saliency, 
amplitude, and velocity of the illusion.
CONCLUSION: The present findings confirm that visuo-proprioceptive integration 
occurs efficiently when the mirror paradigm is coupled with mechanical vibration 
at the lower limbs, thus providing promising new perspectives for 
rehabilitation.

Some Wolbachia endosymbionts induce male killing, whereby male offspring of 
infected females are killed during development; however, the origin and 
diversity of the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we 
identified a 76 kbp prophage region specific to male-killing Wolbachia hosted by 
the moth Homona magnanima. The prophage encoded a homolog of the male-killing 
gene oscar in Ostrinia moths and the wmk gene that induces various toxicities in 
Drosophila melanogaster. Upon overexpressing these genes in D. melanogaster, 
wmk-1 and wmk-3 killed all males and most females, whereas Hm-oscar, wmk-2, and 
wmk-4 had no impact on insect survival. Strikingly, co-expression of tandemly 
arrayed wmk-3 and wmk-4 killed 90% of males and restored 70% of females, 
suggesting their conjugated functions for male-specific lethality. While the 
male-killing gene in the native host remains unknown, our findings highlight the 
role of bacteriophages in male-killing evolution and differences in male-killing 
mechanisms among insects.

Due to their high anion exchange and memory effect, the layered double 
hydroxides (LHDs) have wide applications for some areas. In this work, an 
efficient and green recycling route for layered double hydroxide based 
adsorbents is proposed specifically for application as a poly(vinyl chloride) 
(PVC) heat stabilizer without requiring secondary calcination. Conventional 
magnesium-aluminum hydrotalcite was synthesized using the hydrothermal method 
followed by removal of carbonate anion (CO32-) between LDH layers by 
calcination. The adsorption of perchlorate anion (ClO4-) by the memory effect of 
calcined LDHs with and without ultrasound assistance was compared. Using 
ultrasound assistance, the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbents (291.89 
mg/g) was increased, and the adsorption process was fitted using the kinetic 
Elovich rate equation (R2 = 0.992) and Langmuir adsorption model (R2 = 0.996). 
This material was characterized using XRD, FT-IR, EDS, and TGA which 
demonstrated that ClO4- was intercalated into the hydrotalcite layer 
successfully. The recycled adsorbents were used to augment a commercial 
calcium-zinc-based PVC stabilizer package applied in a epoxidized soybean oil 
plasticized cast sheet which is based on an emulsion type PVC homopolymer resin. 
Use of perchlorate intercalated LDH augmentation yielded significant improvement 
to static heat resistance as indicated by the degree of discoloration with a 
life extension of approximately 60 min. The improved stability was corroborated 
by evaluation of HCl gas evolved during thermal degradation using conductivity 
change curves and the Congo red test.

Background: The incidence of glycolipid metabolic diseases is extremely high 
worldwide, which greatly hinders people's life expectancy and patients' quality 
of life. Oxidative stress (OS) aggravates the development of diseases in 
glycolipid metabolism. Radical oxygen species (ROS) is a key factor in the 
signal transduction of OS, which can regulate cell apoptosis and contribute to 
inflammation. Currently, chemotherapies are the main method to treat disorders 
of glycolipid metabolism, but this can lead to drug resistance and damage to 
normal organs. Botanical drugs are an important source of new drugs. They are 
widely found in nature with availability, high practicality, and low cost. There 
is increasing evidence that herbal medicine has definite therapeutic effects on 
glycolipid metabolic diseases. Objective: This study aims to provide a valuable 
method for the treatment of glycolipid metabolic diseases with botanical drugs 
from the perspective of ROS regulation by botanical drugs and to further promote 
the development of effective drugs for the clinical treatment of glycolipid 
metabolic diseases. Methods: Using herb*, plant medicine, Chinese herbal 
medicine, phytochemicals, natural medicine, phytomedicine, plant extract, 
botanical drug, ROS, oxygen free radicals, oxygen radical, oxidizing agent, 
glucose and lipid metabolism, saccharometabolism, glycometabolism, lipid 
metabolism, blood glucose, lipoprotein, triglyceride, fatty liver, 
atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes, dysglycemia, NAFLD, and DM as keywords or 
subject terms, relevant literature was retrieved from Web of Science and PubMed 
databases from 2013 to 2022 and was summarized. Results: Botanical drugs can 
regulate ROS by regulating mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum, 
phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), erythroid 2-related 
factor 2 (Nrf-2), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and other signaling pathways to 
improve OS and treat glucolipid metabolic diseases. Conclusion: The regulation 
of ROS by botanical drugs is multi-mechanism and multifaceted. Both cell studies 
and animal experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of botanical drugs in 
the treatment of glycolipid metabolic diseases by regulating ROS. However, 
studies on safety need to be further improved, and more studies are needed to 
support the clinical application of botanical drugs.

Background Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inherited multi-system 
disease that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system. New drug 
therapies and treatments are improving the lives of many people with CF. With 
improved life expectancy and increased quality of life, many people with CF are 
now contemplating parenthood and becoming pregnant, an aspiration that decades 
ago was almost unheard of. Given this quickly evolving and more positive health 
landscape, it is vital to understand how people with CF experience the care they 
receive whilst accessing and utilising fertility and maternity services. It is 
also important to explore the experiences of healthcare professionals involved 
in providing care during this period. The overall aim of the mixed-methods 
systematic review will be to explore the barriers and enablers experienced by 
people with CF and the healthcare professionals involved in their care in the 
pre-conception to post-partum period. Methods The proposed review will be 
conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for 
convergent integrated mixed methods systematic reviews. A systematic search of 
Medline (Ebsco), Cinahl, Embase, APA PsychINFO and Cochrane Library from 
inception to February 2022 will be conducted. Quantitative, qualitative and 
mixed methods studies pertaining to the experience of pre-conception to 
post-partum care for people with CF and their healthcare professionals will be 
included. Two independent reviewers will screen titles, abstracts and full texts 
with disagreements being resolved by a third reviewer. Conclusion This review 
will help to determine the potential barriers and facilitators experienced by 
people with Cystic Fibrosis and the health care professionals involved in their 
care during the pre-conception to post-partum period. The results will be of 
benefit specifically to the CF population and their healthcare providers when 
planning further studies in the area of fertility and pregnancy for this 
population and when delivering care.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have a reduced life 
expectancy due to inflammation-related disease including cardiovascular disease 
and diabetes. Abnormal activation of peripheral immune system is postulated as a 
contributor. However, detailed features of the peripheral immune cells in PWS 
have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: Serum inflammatory cytokines were measured in healthy controls (n=13) 
and PWS patients (n=10) using a 65- multiplex cytokine assays. Changes of the 
peripheral immune cells in PWS was assessed by single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) and high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) using peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PWS patients (n=6) and healthy controls (n=12).
RESULTS: PWS patients exhibited hyper-inflammatory signatures in PBMCs and 
monocytes were the most pronounced. Most inflammatory serum cytokines were 
increased in PWS, including IL-1β, IL-2R, IL-12p70, and TNF-α. The 
characteristics of monocytes evaluated by scRNA-seq and CyTOF showed that CD16+ 
monocytes were significantly increased in PWS patients. Functional pathway 
analysis revealed that CD16+ monocytes upregulated pathways in PWS were closely 
associated with TNF/IL-1β- driven inflammation signaling. The CellChat analysis 
identified CD16+ monocytes transmitted chemokine and cytokine signaling to drive 
inflammatory process in other cell types. Finally, we explored the PWS deletion 
region 15q11-q13 might be responsible for elevated levels of inflammation in the 
peripheral immune system.
CONCLUSION: The study highlights that CD16+ monocytes contributor to the 
hyper-inflammatory state of PWS which provides potential targets for 
immunotherapy in the future and expands our knowledge of peripheral immune cells 
in PWS at the single cell level for the first time.

BACKGROUND: With adequate blood transfusion and iron chelation, thalassemia 
patients have a longer life expectancy and experience long-term metabolic 
complications, including osteoporosis, fractures, and bone pain. Alendronate, an 
oral bisphosphonate, is currently used to treat various types of osteoporosis. 
However, the efficacy for the treatment of thalassemia-associated osteoporosis 
remains unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of 
alendronate for the treatment of osteoporosis in thalassemia patients. Patients 
were included if they were males (18-50 years) or premenopausal females with low 
bone mineral density (BMD) (Z-score < -2.0 SD) or positive vertebral deformities 
from vertebral fracture analysis (VFA). Stratified randomization was performed 
according to sex and transfusion status. Patients were 1:1 allocated to receive
