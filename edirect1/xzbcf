confidence interval [CI]) £1412 (€1595) (£1304 [€1473] to £1516 [€1713]) more 
costly than laparoscopic prostatectomy but more effective with mean (95% CI) 
gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 0.08 (0.01-0.15). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £18 329 (€20 708) with an 80% probability 
that robotic prostatectomy was cost effective at a threshold of £30 000 (€33 
894)/QALY. The ICER was sensitive to the throughput of cases and the relative 
positive margin rate favouring robotic prostatectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher costs of robotic prostatectomy may be offset by modest 
health gain resulting from lower risk of early harms and positive margin, 
provided >150 cases are performed each year. Considerable uncertainty persists 
in the absence of directly comparative randomised data.

BACKGROUND: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is approved by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for adults, but its role in older adults 
is unclear.
PURPOSE: To compare PCV13 strategies to currently recommended vaccination 
strategies in adults aged ≥65 years.
METHODS: Using a Markov model, the cost effectiveness of PCV13 and the 23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), alone or in combination, was 
estimated, in adults aged either 65 years or 75 years. No prior vaccination, 
prior vaccination, and vaccine hyporesponsiveness scenarios were examined. 
Pneumococcal disease rates, indirect childhood PCV13 effects, and costs were 
estimated using CDC Active Bacterial Core surveillance data and U.S. national 
databases. An expert panel estimated vaccine-related protection. A societal 
perspective was taken and outcomes were discounted 3% per year.
RESULTS: In those aged 65 years, single-dose PCV13 cost $11,300 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared to no vaccination; at ages 65 
and 80 years, PCV13 cost $83,000/QALY. In those aged 75 years, single-dose PCV13 
cost $62,800/QALY gained. PPSV23 cost more and was less effective than PCV13. 
Results were sensitive to varying vaccine effectiveness and indirect effect 
estimates. In hyporesponsiveness scenarios, cost-effectiveness ratios increased 
by 37%-78% for single-dose strategies and 29%-35% for multiple-dose strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose PCV13 strategies are likely to be economically 
reasonable in older adults.

We present a 5-year survival profile of 42 children and adolescents between 1 to 
21 years of age in an immobile minimally conscious state, chronically dependent 
on supportive ventilation. Data were collected from a 22-bed pediatric unit 
dedicated to this unique population, within a 350-bed geriatric hospital, 
between May 2006 and May 2011. The practice of ventilating children even in 
minimally conscious state stems from the unique cultural, religious, and ethnic 
background of the population in Israel. The 5-year survival probability was 48% 
(52% probability of death within 5 years, 26.5% within 2 years). No significant 
difference was found in the survival profile of patients admitted following 
hypoxic accidents (20 children) and those admitted with other problems such as 
genetic/metabolic diseases or brain anomalies (22). The mortality rate of male 
patients was higher than that of female patients, but the difference was not 
statistically significant. No difference in 5-year mortality rates was found 
between children of different ethnic backgrounds.

Thrombocytosis is a common finding when performing a blood count. It is often 
consecutive to an underlying condition and then does not lead to thrombotic 
complications. If a reactive thrombocytosis is eliminated, thrombocytosis is 
primitive, rarely hereditary and most often associated with hematological 
malignancies. Essential thrombocythemia must be recognized, by eliminating the 
differential diagnoses that are myelodysplastic syndromes associated with 
thrombocytosis and other myeloproliferative disorders. The treatment is based on 
the prevention of thrombotic risk and the possible introduction of a 
cytoreductive therapy. Life expectancy is close to that of the general 
population and mainly depends on the occurrence of myelofibrosis or 
transformation to acute myeloid leukemia.

Examination of the scale properties of living organisms and the electronic 
configuration of crystalline structures suggests that related modeling may be 
used for both. This paper comments on individual and common properties of the 
two systems and draws a comparison between them. Both exhibit multiple 'scales' 
separated by complex or forbidden regions and a global 'overview' of their scale 
properties. We conclude that the analogy may provide a fruitful route toward 
extension of the modeling of both living organisms and electronic materials, by 
permitting bootstrapping cross-modeling between them.

The N-terminal tetra-peptide (IPDE) short extension of the U-box motif in rice 
SPL11 E3 is essential for the interaction with E2 and ubiquitin-ligase activity.

Bae H(1), Kim WT.

Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Republic of Korea.

Rice, a monocot model plant, contains at least 77 U-box E3 ubiquitin 
(Ub)-ligases and 48 E2 Ub-conjugating enzymes. Here, we investigated the minimal 
binding domain of rice SPL11 U-box E3 to its E2 partners. Serial deletions and 
site-directed mutagenesis analyses indicated that, in addition to an intact 
U-box motif, the N-terminal tetra-peptide (IPDE) short extension of the U-box 
was essential for the interaction of SPL11 with E2s and Ub-ligase activity. The 
Ile and Pro residues at the -4 and -3 positions of the U-box, respectively, were 
crucial for this interaction. These results suggest that the N-terminal 
tetra-peptide extension of the U-box participates in the specific interaction of 
SPL11 E3 with E2s in a sequence-specific manner in rice.

BACKGROUND: As worldwide life expectancy rises, the number of candidates for 
surgical treatment of esophageal cancer over 70 years will increase. This study 
aims to examine outcomes after esophagectomy in elderly patients.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of 474 patients undergoing 
esophagectomy for cancer during 2002 to 2011. A total of 334 (70.5%) patients 
were less than 70 years old (group A), 124 (26.2%) 70 to 79 years (group B), and 
16 (3.4%) 80 years or greater (group C). We analyzed the effect of age on 
outcome variables including overall and disease specific survival.
RESULTS: Major morbidity was observed to occur in 115 (35.6%) patients of group 
A, 58 (47.9%) of group B, and 10 (62.5%) of group C (p = 0.010). Mortality, both 
30-day and 90-day was observed in 2 (0.6%) and 7 (2.2%) of group A, 4 (3.2%) and 
7 (6.1%) of group B, and 1 (6.3%) and 2 (14.3%) of group C, respectively (p = 
0.032 and p = 0.013). Anastomotic leak was observed in 16 (4.8%) patients of 
group A, 6 (4.8%) of group B, and 0 (0%) of group C (p = 0.685). Anastomotic 
stricture (defined by the need for ≥ 2 dilations) was observed in 76 (22.8%) of 
group A, 13 (10.5%) of group B, and 1 (6.3%) of group C (p = 0.005). Five-year 
overall and disease specific survival was 64.8% and 72.4% for group A, 41.7% and 
53.4% for group B, 49.2% and 49.2% for group C patients (p = 0.0006), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Esophagectomy should be carefully considered in patients 70 to 79 
years old and can be justified with low mortality. Outcomes in octogenarians are 
worse suggesting esophagectomy be considered on a case by case basis. Stricture 
rate is inversely associated to age.

OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of statins for 
primary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD).
BACKGROUND: Patients with CKD have an elevated risk of MI and stroke. Although 
HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (“statins”) may prevent cardiovascular events in 
patients with non–dialysis-requiring CKD, adverse drug effects and competing 
risks could materially influence net effects and clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model of CKD and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) to determine the cost-effectiveness of low-cost generic statins 
for primary CVD prevention in men and women with hypertension and 
mild-to-moderate CKD. Outcomes included MI and stroke rates, discounted 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime costs (2010 USD), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: For 65-year-old men with moderate hypertension and mild-to-moderate 
CKD, statins reduced the combined rate of MI and stroke, yielded 0.10 QALYs, and 
increased costs by $1,800 ($18,000 per QALY gained). For patients with lower 
baseline cardiovascular risks, health and economic benefits were smaller; for 
65-year-old women, statins yielded 0.06 QALYs and increased costs by $1,900 
($33,400 per QALY gained). Results were sensitive to rates of rhabdomyolysis and 
drug costs. Statins are less cost-effective when obtained at average retail 
prices, particularly in patients at lower CVD risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Although statins reduce absolute CVD risk in patients with CKD, the 
increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, and competing risks associated with 
progressive CKD, partly offset these gains. Low-cost generic statins appear 
cost-effective for primary prevention of CVD in patients with mild-to-moderate 
CKD and hypertension.

The physicochemical, mechanical, optical and structural properties based on 
different amylose content starch-chitosan films with the addition of hydrophilic 
glycerol and hydrophobic perilla oil were investigated, and the effects of the 
starch-chitosan coating on the physicochemical and microbial properties of 
Mongolian cheese were evaluated. The films were formed by casting method. 
Results showed that the incorporation of perilla oil resulted in a decrease in 
moisture content, solubility and mechanical properties and an increase in total 
color difference (ΔE*). High water vapor permeability (WVP), good transparency 
and low solubility were observed with the addition of glycerol. Meanwhile, the 
film based on mung bean starch-chitosan (MSC) exhibited higher moisture content, 
WVP values, ΔE* and less transparency than that based on water chestnut 
starch-chitosan (WSC). The morphology of films was also different based on 
MSC/WSC. The shelf life extension of Mongolian cheese was evaluated at 8 °C. The 
results showed that the cheese coated by WSC film containing perilla oil 
presented better treatment performance in terms of microbial growth delay, 
weight loss and shelf life length.

Since 2002, hundreds of thousands of United States troops have returned from the 
Iraq and Afghanistan theaters, many after multiple deployments. The high suicide 
rate and high prevalence of mood disorders, substance use disorders, and 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this population have been widely 
reported. Many returning soldiers have had difficulty adjusting to civilian 
life, and some have incurred legal charges. In this article, I review the 
prevalence and legal implications of combat-related PTSD in this population, 
including how symptoms of PTSD may be relevant in criminal responsibility 
determinations in jurisdictions that use a M'Naughten standard or American Law 
Institute (ALI) Model Penal Code test for criminal responsibility. Finally, an 
actual case in which a criminal defendant was found to lack criminal 
responsibility in a M'Naughten jurisdiction because of PTSD symptoms at the time 
of the alleged offense will be presented.

Chronic mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibition: preventing cancer to delay 
aging, or vice versa?

Sharp ZD(1), Curiel TJ, Livi CB.

Author information:
(1)Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Biotechnology, San Antonio, 
TX, USA.

Cancer and aging appear to be inexorably linked, yet approaches to ameliorate 
them in concert are lacking. Although not (easily) feasible in humans, years of 
preclinical research show that diet and growth factor restriction each 
successfully address cancer and aging together. Chronic treatment of genetically 
heterogeneous mice with an enteric formulation of rapamycin (eRapa) extended 
maximum lifespan of both genders when started in mid or late life. In part, 
cancer amelioration in treated mice suggested that long-term eRapa, like diet 
restriction, could be a pharmacological approach feasible for use in the clinic. 
We review the current understanding of the role of the mechanistic target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) in cancer and aging. We also discuss the tumor immune 
surveillance system, and the need for a better understanding of its responses to 
mTOR inhibitors. We also address the issue of the misperception that rapamycin 
is a potent immunosuppressant. Finally, we review the current state of mTOR 
inhibitors in the cancer clinic. Because of the burgeoning elderly population 
most at risk for cancer, there is a great need for our eRapa findings to be a 
proof of concept for the development of new and more comprehensive approaches to 
cancer prevention that are safe and also mitigate other deleterious effects of 
aging.

Lifestyle changes, including unhealthy eating habits and high rates of physical 
inactivity and stress, along with an increase in life expectancy have been 
accompanied by increasing rates of chronic non-communicable diseases. Chronic 
diseases are the main causes of death and disability in Brazil. Chronic disease 
management is one of the most important challenges facing health managers who 
are constantly seeking interventions and strategies to reduce costs and hospital 
admissions and to prevent other conditions. However, most existing models of 
health care have focused exclusively on disease, but it is a mistaken approach. 
An integrated approach is required to effectively meet patient needs. The 
purpose of this article was to further discuss policies and strategies for the 
development of new models of care for the elderly with an emphasis on prevention 
and resolution actions.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of drug alternatives with 
rescue therapy in case of relapse due to viral resistance for the treatment of 
patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
METHODS: Hypothetical cohort of patients with CHB, HBeAg-negative, without 
clinical or histological evidence of cirrhosis, detectable HBV DNA, histological 
diagnosis of the disease, positive serum HBsAg for longer than six months, high 
levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (twice as high as the upper limit of 
normality) and mean age of 40 years. A Markov model was developed for chronic 
hepatitis B (HBeAg- negative) with a 40-year time horizon. Costs and benefits 
were discounted at 5%. Annual rates of disease progression, costs due to 
complications and the efficacy of medicines were obtained from the literature. 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis evaluated uncertainties.
RESULTS: Initiation of treatments with entecavir resulted in an increase of 0.35 
discounted life-years gained compared to lamivudine. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was R$16,416.08 per life-years gained. In the 
sensitivity analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was more 
sensitive to variation in the probability of transition from chronic hepatitis B 
to compensated cirrhosis, discount rate and medicine prices (± 10%). In the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the acceptability curve showed that 
beginning treatment with entecavir was the most cost-effective alternative in 
comparison with the use of lamivudine.
CONCLUSIONS: The availability of entecavir is economically attractive as part of 
early treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis B without HIV co-infection.

OBJECTIVE: To compare EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and Short Form-6D (SF-6D) utility 
scores in multiethnic Asian patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
METHODS: Consecutive patients fulfilling the Classification Criteria for 
Psoriatic Arthritis attending a rheumatology outpatient clinic were recruited 
and completed the EQ-5D and SF-6D questionnaires. Comparisons were performed by 
score distribution, mean, median, and the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology 
filter: i.e., truth, discrimination, and feasibility.
RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were enrolled (69 English-speaking and 17 
Chinese-speaking; male:female ratio 0.91). The score distribution of SF-6D was 
normal, while that of EQ-5D was bimodal. A ceiling effect was observed in 20% of 
patients for EQ-5D and none for SF-6D. There were moderate correlations 
(Spearman's rho = 0.59, p < 0.0001) between the 2 scores, but poor agreements on 
scatterplot, intraclass correlation (ICC 0.43 and standardized ICC 0.21), and 
Bland-Altman plots. EQ-5D generated lower utility scores than SF-6D in the 
poorer health subgroup. SF-6D had stronger correlation with the general health 
status and other external measures of health; and it distinguished better 
between good and poor general health status, with better effect size and 
relative efficiency statistics. EQ-5D demonstrated higher patient acceptability.
CONCLUSION: EQ-5D and SF-6D instruments generated different utility scores in 
PsA. SF-6D may be superior because of normal scaling distribution and the 
absence of ceiling and floor effects. SF-6D also had better construct validity 
and better discrimination of poor health status. More studies are required for 
cost-utility analysis in PsA.

Health status, epidemiological profile and prospects: Eastern Mediterranean 
Region.

University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ahmed.mandil@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: This article aims at providing an overview of the current 
epidemiological situation in the heterogeneous Eastern Mediterranean Region 
(EMR). It is one in a series of eight articles appointed by the International 
Epidemiological Association to improve the epidemiological situation.
METHODS: Several resources were used to extract morbidity, mortality and risk 
factors data that contribute mostly to the burden of disease and highlight 
health inequalities. Medline search was used to estimate epidemiological 
publications output by country. Indexing status of Index Medicus for the Eastern 
Mediterranean (IMEMR) journals in Medline/PubMed was checked. A questionnaire 
was designed to collect data from epidemiological associations on type of work 
and workforce. Authors' knowledge and networks were used to get a perspective on 
the training, research and funding sources.
RESULTS: Large inequalities exist between EMR nations especially ones pertaining 
to social conflicts. The EMR age-standardized disability-adjusted life years 
rate per 1000 population is higher than the global one, with most contribution 
of communicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries (45%) and 
non-communicable diseases in high-income countries (64%). Iran and Pakistan have 
the highest number of publications from 1996-2012, but Kuwait has the highest 
rate of publications per 100,000 population. The majority of IMEMR journals are 
not indexed in Medline/PubMed. Masters in Public Health is the most common form 
of training.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts are required to ameliorate the epidemiological situation. 
There is a dire need for health evidence-based policy change and for field 
training of epidemiologists.

Similar to other industrialized countries, Germany's population is ageing. 
Whereas some people enjoy good physical and cognitive health into old age, 
others suffer from a multitude of age-related disorders and impairments which 
reduce life expectancy and affect quality of life. To identify and characterize 
the factors associated with 'healthy' vs. 'unhealthy' ageing, we have launched 
the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II), a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional 
project that ascertains a large number of ageing-related variables from a wide 
range of different functional domains. Phenotypic assessments include factors 
related to geriatrics and internal medicine, immunology, genetics, psychology, 
sociology and economics. Baseline recruitment of the BASE-II cohort was recently 
completed and has led to the sampling of 1600 older adults (age range 60-80 
years), as well as 600 younger adults (20-35 years) serving as the basic 
population for in-depth analyses. BASE-II data are linked to the German 
Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), a long-running panel survey representative of 
the German population, to estimate sample selectivity. A major goal of BASE-II 
is to facilitate collaboration with other research groups by freely sharing 
relevant phenotypic and genotypic data with qualified outside investigators.

How methodologic differences affect results of economic analyses: a systematic 
review of interferon gamma release assays for the diagnosis of LTBI.

INTRODUCTION: Cost effectiveness analyses (CEA) can provide useful information 
on how to invest limited funds, however they are less useful if different 
analysis of the same intervention provide unclear or contradictory results. The 
objective of our study was to conduct a systematic review of methodologic 
aspects of CEA that evaluate Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRA) for the 
detection of Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI), in order to understand how 
differences affect study results.
METHODS: A systematic review of studies was conducted with particular focus on 
study quality and the variability in inputs used in models used to assess 
cost-effectiveness. A common decision analysis model of the IGRA versus 
Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) screening strategy was developed and used to quantify 
the impact on predicted results of observed differences of model inputs taken 
from the studies identified.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies were ultimately included in the review. Several 
specific methodologic issues were identified across studies, including how study 
inputs were selected, inconsistencies in the costing approach, the utility of 
the QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year) as the effectiveness outcome, and how 
authors choose to present and interpret study results. When the IGRA versus TST 
test strategies were compared using our common decision analysis model predicted 
effectiveness largely overlapped.
IMPLICATIONS: Many methodologic issues that contribute to inconsistent results 
and reduced study quality were identified in studies that assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of the IGRA test. More specific and relevant guidelines are 
needed in order to help authors standardize modelling approaches, inputs, 
assumptions and how results are presented and interpreted.

Kinetics of isomerization and inversion of aspartate 58 of αA-crystallin peptide 
mimics under physiological conditions.

Aki K(1), Fujii N, Fujii N.

Although proteins consist exclusively of L-amino acids, we have reported that 
aspartyl (Asp) 58 and Asp 151 residues of αA-crystallin of eye lenses from 
elderly cataract donors are highly inverted and isomerized to D-β, D-α and 
L-β-Asp residues through succinimide intermediates. Of these Asp isomers, large 
amounts of D-β- and L-β-isomers are present but the amount of D-α-isomer is not 
significant. The difference in abundance of the Asp isomers in the protein may 
be due to the rate constants for the formation of the isomers. However, the 
kinetics have not been well defined. Therefore, in this study, we synthesized a 
peptide corresponding to human αA-crystallin residues 55 to 65 
(T(55)VLD(58)SGISEVR(65)) and its isomers in which L-α-Asp at position 58 was 
replaced with L-β-, D-β- and D-α-Asp and determined the rate of isomerization 
and inversion of Asp residues under physiological conditions (37°C, pH7.4). The 
rate constant for dehydration from L-α-Asp peptide to L-succinimidyl peptide was 
3 times higher than the rate constant for dehydration from L-β-Asp peptide to 
L-succinimidyl peptide. The rate constant for hydrolysis from L-succinimidyl 
peptide to L-β-Asp peptide was about 5 times higher than the rate constant for 
hydrolysis from L-succinimidyl peptide to L-α-Asp peptide. The rate constant for 
dehydration from L-α-Asp peptide to L-succinimidyl peptide was 2 times higher 
than the rate constant for dehydration from D-α-Asp peptide to D-succinimidyl 
peptide. The rate constants for hydrolysis from L-succinimidyl peptide to 
L-β-Asp peptide and for hydrolysis from D-succinimidyl peptide to D-β-Asp 
peptide were almost equal. Using these rate constants, we calculated the change 
in the abundance ratios of the 4 Asp isomers during a human lifespan. This 
result is consistent with the fact that isomerized Asp residues accumulate in 
proteins during the ageing process.

BACKGROUND: Omalizumab has been shown to decrease the risk of hospitalization or 
ED visits in patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma compared with 
placebo. This longitudinal study observed the conditions under which omalizumab 
is prescribed in real-life settings and assessed whether its use as an add-on 
therapy alongside standard treatments decreases the risk of severe asthmatic 
exacerbations.
METHODS: A cohort of adult patients with uncontrolled severe asthma despite 
optimal treatment with inhaled and oral corticosteroids and a long-acting b 2 
-agonist but no treatment with omalizumab upon entry was assembled. Risk of 
hospitalization or ED visits for asthma exacerbation was assessed using the 
Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox model for repeated events, controlling for 
age, sex, smoking history, BMI, gastroesophageal reflux, allergic status, 
allergic rhinitis, treatment, and hospitalization or ED visits for asthma in the 
2 months prior to omalizumab treatment.
RESULTS: Overall, 163 physicians recruited 767 patients, of whom 374 took 
omalizumab at least once (mean observation period, 20.4 months). Omalizumab use 
was associated with an adjusted relative risk of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.78) for 
hospitalization or ED visits for asthma. In users of omalizumab, the adjusted 
relative risk of hospitalization or ED visits for asthma during omalizumab 
treatment vs nontreatment periods was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.28-0.58).
CONCLUSIONS: Add-on omalizumab is associated with a significantly decreased risk 
of hospitalization or ED visits in patients with uncontrolled severe asthma in 
real-life practice.

fred.ruddick@cumbria.ac.uk

All nurses are expected to promote patients' health and this includes physical 
and psychological wellbeing. In this article the author argues that we already 
have much of the knowledge necessary to enhance public mental health and that we 
need to focus more on the factors that promote a state of positive wellbeing 
rather than on what makes people ill. Nurses work in a variety of services and 
are in an ideal position to promote patients' sense of empowerment and 
resilience by helping them to acknowledge their resources, rather than focusing 
on their disability or illness.

Is the rate of cerebral hemorrhages declining among stroke patients in South 
America?

Ecuador; School of Medicine, Universidad de Especialidades Espíritu Santo, 
Guayaquil, Ecuador.

Recent stroke registries suggest that the rate of cerebral hemorrhages is 
declining among stroke patients in South America. High rates of cerebral 
hemorrhages (approaching 40% of stroke cases) reported in pioneer registries 
during the 1990s have not been duplicated in more recent studies. In contrast, 
almost all studies recruiting patients from 2003 on, reported less than 20% of 
cerebral hemorrhages among their stroke patients. Intermediate rates of 
hemorrhagic strokes (from 25% to 27%) were noted among registries recruiting 
patients by the end of the 20th century and the start of the new Millennium. We 
also noted a significant declining rate of hemorrhagic stroke over the past 20 
years at our Institution. In a series of 651 consecutive first-ever stroke 
patients included in the Hospital-Clínica Kennedy stroke registry (Guayaquil), 
cerebral hemorrhages accounted for 26·3% of patients recruited between 1990 and 
1994 but for only 16·5% of those seen between 2005 and 2009 (P = 0·03). More 
longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine 
whether the reported declining rate of hemorrhagic strokes in South America is 
related to increase life expectancy of the population, or to changes in 
lifestyle, dietary habits, or some other specific stroke risk factors not well 
evaluated so far.

Educational outcomes of a collaborative school-home behavioral intervention for 
ADHD.

This study evaluated educationally relevant outcomes from a newly developed 
collaborative school-home intervention (Collaborative Life Skills Program [CLS]) 
for youth with attention and/or behavior problems. Participants included 17 
girls and 40 boys in second through fifth grades (mean age = 8.1 years) from 
diverse ethnic backgrounds. CLS was implemented by 10 school-based mental health 
professionals at their schools and included 3 integrated components over 12 
weeks: group behavioral parent training, classroom behavioral intervention, and 
a child social and independence skills group. Parent and teacher ratings of 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, organizational skills, 
and homework problems, and teacher-rated academic skills, report card grades, 
academic achievement, and classroom observations of student engagement were 
measured before and after treatment. Significant pre-post improvement was found 
for all measures, with large effect sizes for ADHD symptoms, organizational 
skills, and homework problems, and medium to large effects for teacher-rated 
academic skills, report card grades, academic achievement, and student 
engagement. Improvements in organizational skills mediated the relationship 
between improvement in ADHD symptoms and academic skills. Significant 
improvement in both ratings and objective measures (achievement testing, report 
cards, classroom observations) suggests that improvement exceeded what might be 
accounted for by expectancy or passage of time. Findings support the focus of 
CLS on both ADHD symptom reduction and organizational skill improvement and 
support the feasibility of a model which utilizes school-based mental health 
professionals as providers.

    Expert Rev Neurother. 2018 Jan;18(1):5-8.

RATIONALE: Stroke and cardiovascular diseases will be the next health epidemics 
in Latin America due to increased life expectancy and changes in the lifestyle 
and dietary habits of the population. Knowledge of the cardiovascular health 
status of the inhabitants will allow the implementation of policies directed to 
reduce the burden of stroke and cardiovascular diseases in the region.
AIMS: To evaluate the cardiovascular health status of the inhabitants of 
Atahualpa (a rural village in coastal Ecuador) and to determine the prevalence 
and incidence of stroke and ischemic heart disease in the region.
DESIGN: Three-phase epidemiologic survey. During phase I, Atahualpa residents 
aged ≥40 years will be screened with standardized questionnaires to evaluate 
their cardiovascular health and to identify those with suspected stroke or 
ischemic heart disease. In phase II, neurologists and cardiologists will examine 
suspected cases of stroke or ischemic heart disease, as well as a random sample 
of matched negative individuals, to assess the prevalence and incidence of these 
conditions. In phase III, patients with a diagnosis of stroke and ischemic heart 
disease will undergo complementary tests for achieving a more specific 
diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: Implementation of public health strategies directed to improve the 
cardiovascular health status of a given population must be based on studies 
evaluating specific risk factors at regional levels. Epidemiologic surveys such 
as the Atahualpa Project may prove cost-effective in improving the 
cardiovascular health status of people living in Latin American rural villages 
by increasing the knowledge on the particular needs of these populations.

Potential gains in life expectancy from reducing heart disease, cancer, 
Alzheimer's disease, kidney disease or HIV/AIDS as major causes of death in the 
USA.

OBJECTIVES: Potential gains in life expectancy (PGLEs) that give proper 
consideration to competing risks are an effective indicator for measuring the 
impact of multiple causes of death on a defined population. This study aimed to 
assess PGLE by hypothetically reducing the major causes of death in the USA from 
2001 to 2008.
STUDY DESIGN: PGLEs due to the reduction and elimination of heart disease, 
cancer, Alzheimer's disease, kidney disease or human immunodeficiency 
virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) were calculated by age, 
gender and race.
METHODS: Age-specific mortality rates for the above diseases from the National 
Center for Health Statistics were used, and multiple decremental life tables 
were constructed to compute the corresponding PGLEs.
RESULTS: PGLEs due to the elimination of heart disease, cancer or HIV/AIDS 
decreased from 2001 to 2008, but PGLEs due to the elimination of Alzheimer's 
disease or kidney disease increased over time. For heart disease, PGLE in 
2001-2008 for all races was 2.78-2.15 for females vs 2.41-2.06 for males. For 
cancer, PGLE in 2001-2008 for all races was 2.97-2.81 for females vs 3.02-2.85 
for males. HIV/AIDS has a greater impact on people of working age, whereas 
Alzheimer's disease has a greater impact on the elderly population. To compare 
the impacts of these diseases on life expectancy, partial multiple decremental 
life tables were constructed, and PGLEs were computed by a partial reduction or 
complete elimination of various causes of death for the entire life span as well 
as for certain working ages.
CONCLUSION: This study outlined a picture of how each category of diseases could 
affect life expectancy in the US population by age, race or sex. The findings 
may assist in evaluating current public health improvements, and also provide
