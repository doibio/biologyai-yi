of HIV+ patient has become longer and this meant that he would start ageing. 
International literature demonstrated that the HIV+ patient is more fragile than 
any other person of the same age and that doesn't present the viral infection.
OBJECTIVE: design, development and test of a new web-based instrument to allow 
the self-administration of the new questionnaire SELFY MPI created during the 
European project Effichronic. Materials &amp; Methods: between June and 
September 2018, a group of senior 50 HIV+ patients, was involved. The 
questionnaire SELFY MPI enables to collect data about quality of life and 
cognitive functions.
RESULTS: the developed web-instrument collects pseudo-anonymous data into the 
Liguria HIV Network database. The subsequent statistical analysis highlighted a 
correlation between the two outcomes of SELFY MPI and the laboratory exam's 
parameter TCD4+ and viral load.
CONCLUSIONS: the great potentiality of this instrument is not only the support 
given to clinical research about the effects of HIV on chronical disease 
management but it can be also used as a follow-up instrument to evaluate 
different aspects of the geriatric patient life during the years.

Thrombotic disorders remain the leading cause of mortality and morbidity, 
despite the fact that anti-platelet therapies and vascular implants are 
successfully used today. As life expectancy is increasing in western societies, 
the specific knowledge about processes leading to thrombosis in elderly is 
essential for an adequate therapeutic management of platelet dysfunction and for 
tailoring blood contacting implants. This study addresses the limited available 
data on platelet function in apparently healthy subjects in relation to age, 
particularly in view of subjects of old age (80-98 years). Apparently healthy 
subjects between 20 and 98 years were included in this study. Platelet function 
was assessed by light transmission aggregometry and comprised experiments on 
spontaneous as well as ristocetin-, ADP- and collagen-induced platelet 
aggregation. The data of this study revealed a non-linear increase in the 
maximum spontaneous platelet aggregation (from 3.3% ±3.3% to 10.9% ±5.9%). The 
maximum induced aggregation decreased with age for ristocetin (from 85.8% ±7.2% 
to 75.0% ±7.8%), ADP (from 88.5% ±4.6% to 64.8% ±7.3%) and collagen (from 89.5% 
±3.0% to 64.0% ±4.0%) in a non-linear manner (linear regression analysis). These 
observations indicate that during aging, circulating platelets become 
increasingly activated but lose their full aggregatory potential, a phenomenon 
that was earlier termed "platelet exhaustion". In this study we extended the 
limited existing data for spontaneous and induced platelet aggregation of 
apparently healthy donors above the age of 75 years. The presented data indicate 
that the extrapolation of data from a middle age group does not necessarily 
predict platelet function in apparently healthy subjects of old age. It 
emphasizes the need for respective studies to improve our understanding of 
thrombotic processes in elderly humans.

Social surveys prospectively linked with death records provide invaluable 
opportunities for the study of the relationship between social and economic 
circumstances and mortality. Although survey-linked mortality files play a 
prominent role in U.S. health disparities research, it is unclear how well 
mortality estimates from these datasets align with one another and whether they 
are comparable with U.S. vital statistics data. We conduct the first study that 
systematically compares mortality estimates from several widely-used 
survey-linked mortality files and U.S. vital statistics data. Our results show 
that mortality rates and life expectancies from the National Health Interview 
Survey Linked Mortality Files, Health and Retirement Study, Americans' Changing 
Lives study, and U.S. vital statistics data are similar. Mortality rates are 
slightly lower and life expectancies are slightly higher in these linked 
datasets relative to vital statistics data. Compared with vital statistics and 
other survey-linked datasets, General Social Survey-National Death Index life 
expectancy estimates are much lower at younger adult ages and much higher at 
older adult ages. Cox proportional hazard models regressing all-cause mortality 
risk on age, gender, race, educational attainment, and marital status conceal 
the issues with the General Social Survey-National Death Index that are observed 
in our comparison of absolute measures of mortality risk. We provide 
recommendations for researchers who use survey-linked mortality files.

Compared with Other Countries.

BACKGROUND: Mortality estimates from various sources suggest that Costa Ricans 
experience record-high life expectancy at birth in Latin America and higher 
longevity than the populations of many high-income countries, although there is 
some uncertainty as to the reliability of those estimates.
OBJECTIVE: We construct a life table series for Costa Rica to assess the quality 
of national demographic statistics for the period 1950-2013 and to determine 
whether reliable mortality estimates can be directly calculated from these data.
METHODS: We apply the methods from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) to 
national statistics to construct the Costa Rica life table series without 
adjusting for data quality, and we validate our results through internal 
consistency by evaluating the plausibility of the mortality patterns and its 
change over time and through external consistency by comparing our results with 
those from other sources.
RESULTS: Our mortality estimates for Costa Rica tend to be lower than others, 
especially for the period before 1970. They also produce a suspicious age 
pattern of mortality, with low adult and old-age mortality relative to the 
infant and child mortality, casting doubt on the quality of national demographic 
data.
CONCLUSIONS: Other organizations have produced mortality estimates for Costa 
Rica that are higher than our unadjusted estimates, but it is difficult to 
evaluate the accuracy of the available estimates.
CONTRIBUTION: This analysis provides a more thorough evaluation of data quality 
issues regarding Costa Rica mortality than previously available. Unadjusted life 
tables by sex for 1950-2013 are included as supplemental material, together with 
the raw data upon which those life tables are based and with links to the 
detailed methods protocol implemented.

Grass Lolium perenne L. Growing in Karst Soil.

Karst regions are characterized by heterogeneous soil habitats, with shallow 
wide soil (SW) on hilly slopes and deep narrow soil (DN) in rocky trenches. To 
make full use of limited water and nutrients, plants have therefore developed a 
number of root extension strategies. This study investigated the effect of soil 
moisture on horizontal root extension in SW and vertical root extension in DN by 
assessing root growth responses, biomass allocation, and root distribution. A 
full two-way factorial blocked design of soil dimensions by water availability 
was followed. The perennial grass Lolium perenne L. was grown in SW and DN under 
high (W100%), moderate (W50%), and low (W30%) water availability, respectively. 
The main results were as follows: (1) The total biomass of L. perenne was not 
influenced either by soil habitat or by water application. Root length, root 
surface area, root biomass and root to shoot ratio all decreased with decreasing 
water application in SW, but not in DN soil. (2) With decreasing water 
application, the cumulative percentage of root length, root surface area and 
root biomass in 4 rings from the center out to 12 cm of SW soil showed a trend 
of W50% > W30% > W100% in SW, however, the cumulative percentage of root biomass 
in 4 layers from the surface to a depth of 36 cm was not significantly different 
between different water treatments in DN. (3) Under all three water treatments, 
specific root length showed an increase but root length density showed a 
decreasing trend from the center outward in SW soil or from the surface to 
bottom in DN soil. Overall, these results suggest that in SW habitat, soil 
moisture determines horizontal expansion of the roots in L. perenne, although 
the overall expansion ability was limited in severe drought. However, due to the 
relatively strong water retention ability, soil moisture changes were less 
obvious in DN, resulting in no significant vertical extension of the root 
system. The root response of L. perenne helps our understanding of how 
herbaceous plants can adjust their belowground morphology to support their 
growth in harsh karst soil environments.

Overview of current and future research and clinical directions for drug 
discontinuation: psychological, traditional and professional obstacles to 
deprescribing.

The vicious circle of age-related diseases, many experts and guidelines/drugs 
fuels the 21st century iatrogenic epidemic of inappropriate medication use and 
polypharmacy. There are no evidence-based medicine (EBM) 'guidelines' for 
treating older people, and knowledge gaps regarding dosage requirements. For all 
drugs, the positive benefit/risk ratio is decreasing/inverted in correlation to 
very old age, comorbidity, dementia, frailty and limited life-expectancy 
(VOCODFLEX). Main obstacles to routine deprescribing are emotional/psychological 
myths; patient-doctor interactions are expected to be transformed into 
prescription; doctors are perceived as expert prescribers who wisely choose the 
right medication/s to treat all diseases. Although most 'guidelines' were not 
proven in older people, particularly VOCODFLEX, doctors are afraid of lawsuits 
and of the patient/family reaction if they do not follow all experts' 
recommendations. Doctors are frustrated facing uncertainty regarding the 
effectiveness of strategies to reduce polypharmacy and the lack of EBM 
indicating when to de-prescribe. When explicit criteria and 'drugs to avoid' are 
used alone, we may disregard undiagnosed harms imposed by the remaining drug 
groups and interactions. The best approaches are implicit tools that take into 
consideration EBM data, clinical circumstances and medical judgement. The 
Garfinkel Good Palliative-Geriatric Practice method recommends deprescribing of 
as many drugs as possible simultaneously, giving high priority to patient/family 
preferences. It was proven highly effective and safe in nursing departments and 
in community-dwelling elders, having significant economic benefits as well.

Avoiding inappropriate polypharmacy has become increasingly recognised as a 
safety imperative for older patient care. Deprescribing is an active process of 
reviewing all medications being used by individual patients that prompts 
clinicians to consider which medications have unfavourable risk-benefit 
trade-offs in the context of illness severity, advanced age, multi-morbidity, 
physical and emotional capacity, life expectancy, care goals and personal 
preferences. Structured guides to deprescribing include algorithms, flow charts 
or tables which are patient-directed and aim to guide the clinician through 
sequential steps in deciding which medications should be targeted for 
discontinuation. In this narrative review, we describe seven structured 
deprescribing guides whose stated purpose included the reduction of 
polypharmacy, their use was not restricted to a single drug or drug class and 
they had undergone some form of efficacy testing. There was considerable 
heterogeneity in guide design and content, with some guides constituting little 
more than a set of principles while others entail detailed processes and 
sub-steps which addressed multiple determinants of drug appropriateness. 
Evidence of effectiveness for each guide was limited in that none have been 
evaluated in randomised controlled trials, that pilot or feasibility studies 
have involved relatively small patient samples, that intra-rater and inter-rater 
reliabilities have not been determined and that most have been studied in 
hospital settings. Which is most useful to clinicians is unknown in the absence 
of head-to-head comparisons. While most guides have face validity, more research 
is needed for determining effectiveness and ease of use in routine clinical 
practice, especially in primary care settings.

PURPOSE: Two anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies are 
approved for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) 
and tisagenlecleucel; each costs $373,000. We evaluated their cost 
effectiveness.
METHODS: We used a decision analytic Markov model informed by recent 
multicenter, single-arm trials to evaluate axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel in 
multiply relapsed/refractory, adult, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from a US 
health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. Under a range of plausible 
long-term effectiveness assumptions, each therapy was compared with salvage 
chemoimmunotherapy regimens and stem-cell transplantation. Main outcomes were 
undiscounted life years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3% annual discount 
rate). Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty.
RESULTS: In an optimistic scenario, assuming a 40% 5-year progression-free 
survival (PFS), axi-cel increased life expectancy by 8.2 years at $129,000/QALY 
gained (95% uncertainty interval, $90,000 to $219,000). At a 30% 5-year PFS, 
improvements in life expectancy were more modest (6.4 years) and expensive 
($159,000/QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval, $105,000 to $284,000]). In an 
optimistic scenario, assuming a 35% 5-year PFS, tisagenlecleucel increased life 
expectancy by 4.6 years at $168,000/QALY gained (95% uncertainty interval, 
$105,000 to $414,000/QALY). At a 25% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy 
were smaller (3.4 years) and more expensive ($223,000/QALY gained [95% 
uncertainty interval, $123,000 to $1,170,000/QALY]). Administering CAR-T to all 
indicated patients would increase US health care costs by approximately $10 
billion over 5 years. Price reductions to $250,000 and $200,000, respectively, 
or payment only for initial complete response (at current prices) would allow 
axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel to cost less than $150,000/QALY, even at 25% PFS.
CONCLUSION: At 2018 prices, it is possible that both CAR-T therapies meet a less 
than $150,000/QALY threshold. This depends on long-term outcomes compared with 
chemoimmunotherapy and stem-cell transplantation, which are uncertain. 
Widespread adoption would substantially increase non-Hodgkin lymphoma health 
care costs. Price reductions or payment for initial response would improve cost 
effectiveness, even with modest long-term outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of age at implantation on the 
cost-effectiveness of cochlear implantation (CI).
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis in an adapted Markov model.
SETTING: Adults with profound postlingual hearing loss in a "high income" 
country.
INTERVENTION: Unilateral and sequential CI were compared with hearing aids (HA).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), calculated as 
costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained (in CHF/QALY), for individual 
age and sex combinations in relation to two different willingness to pay 
thresholds. 1 CHF (Swiss franc) is equivalent to 1.01 USD.
RESULTS: When a threshold of 50,000 CHF per QALY is applied, unilateral CI in 
comparison to HA is cost-effective up to an age of 91 for women and 89 for men. 
Sequential CI in comparison to HA is cost-effective up to an age of 87 for women 
and 85 for men. If a more contemporary threshold of 100,000 CHF per QALY is 
applied, sequential CI in comparison to unilateral CI is cost-effective up to an 
age of 80 for women and 78 for men.
CONCLUSIONS: Performing both sequential and unilateral CI is cost-effective up 
to very advanced ages when compared with hearing aids.

BACKGROUND: Results from large randomised controlled trials have shown that 
adding docetaxel to the standard of care (SOC) for men initiating hormone 
therapy for prostate cancer (PC) prolongs survival for those with metastatic 
disease and prolongs failure-free survival for those without. To date there has 
been no formal assessment of whether funding docetaxel in this setting 
represents an appropriate use of UK National Health Service (NHS) resources.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether administering docetaxel to men with PC starting 
long-term hormone therapy is cost-effective in a UK setting.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We modelled health outcomes and costs in the 
UK NHS using data collected within the STAMPEDE trial, which enrolled men with 
high-risk, locally advanced metastatic or recurrent PC starting first-line 
hormone therapy.
INTERVENTION: SOC was hormone therapy for ≥2 yr and radiotherapy in some 
patients. Docetaxel (75mg/m2) was administered alongside SOC for six 
three-weekly cycles.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The model generated lifetime 
predictions of costs, changes in survival duration, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The model predicted that docetaxel would extend 
survival (discounted quality-adjusted survival) by 0.89 yr (0.51) for metastatic 
PC and 0.78 yr (0.39) for nonmetastatic PC, and would be cost-effective in 
metastatic PC (ICER £5514/QALY vs SOC) and nonmetastatic PC (higher QALYs, lower 
costs vs SOC). Docetaxel remained cost-effective in nonmetastatic PC when the 
assumption of no survival advantage was modelled.
CONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel is cost-effective among patients with nonmetastatic and 
metastatic PC in a UK setting. Clinicians should consider whether the evidence 
is now sufficiently compelling to support docetaxel use in patients with 
nonmetastatic PC, as the opportunity to offer docetaxel at hormone therapy 
initiation will be missed for some patients by the time more mature survival 
data are available.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Starting docetaxel chemotherapy alongside hormone therapy 
represents a good use of UK National Health Service resources for patients with 
prostate cancer that is high risk or has spread to other parts of the body.

BACKGROUND: Active surveillance (AS) has limitations that include missing 
high-risk tumors and performing unnecessary biopsies. The use of multiparametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in AS may overcome these limitations, but its 
cost-effectiveness remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of three AS strategies: AS with 
transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSGB), AS with mpMRI and MRI 
ultrasound-guided biopsy (MR-TRUSGB), and AS with mpMRI without biopsies.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A Markov cohort model for men with low-risk 
prostate cancer was developed to assess the three strategies. Input data were 
derived from meta-analysis, other published literature, and national cost 
reports. A health care perspective was used for a European setting.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Health care costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were modeled over a lifetime horizon. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to address 
uncertainty in model parameters.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In the base case analysis, expected mean costs per man 
screened were €5150 for TRUSGB, €5994 for mpMRI without biopsy, and €4848 for 
mpMRI with biopsy. Corresponding QALYs were higher for mpMRI with biopsy 
compared to TRUSGB (18.67 vs 18.66) and lower for mpMRI without biopsy compared 
to TRUSGB (18.27 vs 18.66). Owing to lower costs and higher effects, the mpMRI 
with biopsy strategy was cost-effective compared to the TRUSGB strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: mpMRI with MR-TRUSGB appears to be the most cost-effective AS 
strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We compared costs and quality of life for the standard active 
surveillance (AS) program for men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer to a 
monitoring program comprising multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) 
with and without biopsies. Our results suggest that an AS strategy using mpMRI 
with biopsy improves quality of life and costs decrease. An AS strategy using 
mpMRI without biopsy was not beneficial compared to the standard program.

OBJECTIVE: Carbamazepine, widely used in the treatment of partial and 
generalized tonic-clonic seizures, has been associated with life-threatening 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis among some Asians. The 
HLA-B*1502 genotype that occurs with varying frequency among Asians is 
recommended for screening prior to starting carbamazepine. Our goal is to 
explore the cost-effectiveness of screening for the presence of this genetic 
allele.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model in a hypothetical cohort of adult Asian 
patients with epilepsy in the United States being considered for carbamazepine 
to investigate the cost-effectiveness of two alternative strategies: (1) no 
HLA-B*1502 gene allele screening and using carbamazepine and (2) HLA-B*1502 gene 
allele screening and starting levetiracetam in the case of a positive screen.
RESULTS: For the lifetime horizon, HLA-B*1502 gene screening was the 
cost-effective choice compared to no gene screening, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $27 058 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), below 
the $50 000/QALY threshold in 99.69% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses. 
Although gene screening strategy was more expensive than a no screening 
strategy, it was more effective, yielding more QALYs, across all Asian ethnic 
groups.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our analysis confirms the 2007 US Food and Drug Administration 
recommendation to screen for HLA-B*1502 allele before starting treatment with 
carbamazepine in patients of Asian ancestry in the United States.

BACKGROUND: Pedophilic disorder is characterized by increased sexual interest 
towards children, with comparatively lesser interest towards adults. In real 
life, the behavior of subjects with pedophilic disorder is shaped by evaluative 
processes in response to sexually relevant cues. Therefore, brain activation 
during anticipation of sexually relevant cues is of potential interest. Whereas 
previous research demonstrated reduced activation when viewing adult 
(non-preferred) sexual stimuli in pedophilic sex offenders (PSOs), it is not 
known if anticipation of preferred versus unpreferred stimuli will elicit 
differential brain activation.
METHODS: Two fMRI studies (1.5 and 7 Tesla) were conducted in separate samples, 
each with 26 subjects (13/13 PSOs/controls) to assess brain activity during 
expectancy of subsequent adult (non-preferred) sexual stimuli. In the second 
study (7 Tesla) additionally child (preferred) cues were presented.
RESULTS: As predicted, expectancy of adult sexual stimuli generated smaller 
dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation in PSOs in both studies, 
driven by stronger activation during expectancy of adult erotic stimuli in 
non-pedophilic controls (HCs). In the second study, PSOs showed significantly 
increased activations in dACC during expectancy of child stimuli compared with 
expectancy of adult stimuli. This difference was significantly greater compared 
to the same contrast in HCs, thus demonstrating preference specificity of dACC 
activation.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support the notion of decreased brain activation to 
adult cues in PSOs and preference specificity in neural response during 
expectancy of erotic stimuli. The localization of these cue reactivity 
differences in the salience network supports the interpretation that PSOs show 
abnormally increased preparatory activation even before relevant sexual stimuli 
are actually presented.

The growth of yeasts, lactic acid bacteria, pseudomonads, and enterobacteria 
during the refrigerated storage of an Italian soft cheese (Stracchino) in 
various packaging conditions (under air, under vacuum, and in the presence of 
ethanol) was studied. Yeasts were found to play a significant role in cheese 
spoilage, producing unplesant flavors and odors and causing significant 
reductions in the shelf life of the paper-wrapped cheeses. Packaging under 
vacuum decreased the yeast growth rates and reduced the populations attained at 
the end of the exponential phase of growth, resulting in a shelf-life extension 
of the Stracchino cheese of over 28 days. A total of 129 yeasts isolates were 
identified according to conventional methods. The most frequently isolated 
yeasts were Candida colliculosa , Debaryomyces hansenii , and Candida famata . 
Other species encountered were Tolurospora delbrueckii , Kluyveromyces marxianus 
, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The growth of spoilage bacteria results in a shorter shelf life of meat, causing 
economic losses to the meat industry. Based on 23S rDNA sequence data of 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa , two primers designated as PF (23 bases) and PR (20 
bases) were synthesized for use in the polymerase chain reaction. A unique 
207-base-pair DNA product from nine different bacteria typically associated with 
meat spoilage was amplified by the primers. Dot blot analysis with the internal 
DNA probe specific for the amplified products confirmed that the amplified DNA 
sequence is specific for the spoilage bacteria studied.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a widespread problem in the elderly, being associated 
with severe comorbidities negatively influencing life expectancy. Integrated 
multidisciplinary metabolic rehabilitation aimed to reduce body weight (BW) and 
fatigue, increase physical autonomy and introduce healthy life style changes has 
been proposed as a useful intervention to improve the general health status and 
quality of life of the obese geriatric population.
METHODS: Six hundred-eighty four severely obese subjects (F/M = 592/92; age 
range: 61-83 years; mean body mass index, BMI ± SD: 42.6 ± 5.6 kg/m2) were 
admitted to take part in a three-week in-hospital BW reduction program (BWRP), 
entailing energy restricted diet, psychological counselling, physical 
rehabilitation and nutritional education. Biochemical parameters, cardiovascular 
risk factors (throughout the Coronary Heart Disease Risk, CHD-R), fatigue 
(throughout the Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS) and lower limb muscle performance 
(throughout the Stair Climbing Test, SCT) were evaluated before and at the end 
of the BWRP.
RESULTS: A 4% BW reduction was achieved at the end of the BWRP. This finding was 
associated with a significant improvement of the metabolic homeostasis (i.e., 
decrease in total cholesterol and glucose) and a reduction of systolic blood 
pressure in both females and males, thus resulting in a reduction of CHD-R in 
the male group. Total FSS score and SCT time decreased in female and male obese 
patients. The effects of BWPR were comparable among all age-related subgroups 
(>60, 60-69 and >70 years), apart from ΔCHD-R, which was higher in male 
subgroups. Finally, age was negatively correlated with ΔBMI and ΔFSS.
CONCLUSIONS: Though only a relatively limited number of outcomes were 
investigated, the present study shows that a 4% BW reduction in severely elderly 
obese patients is associated with positive multisystemic effects, particularly, 
muscle-skeletal and cardiometabolic benefits, which can favorably influence 
their general well-being and improve the autonomy level in performing more 
common daily activities. The maintenance of a healthy life style, including 
controlled food intake and regular physical activity, after a BWRP is obviously 
recommended in all elderly obese patients to further improve their clinical 
condition.

: In this work, ultrahigh drug-loaded chitosan (Ch)/K-carrageenan (Kc) 
polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) beads were formed in situ by cross-linking in a 
glutaraldehyde-saturated atmosphere and were prepared on superhydrophobic 
substrates fabricated by spraying glass surfaces with ready-made spray for 
domestic use (NeverWet®). Verapamil hydrochloride (VP), a highly hydrophilic 
drug with a short biological half-life, was incorporated into a series of 
Ch-based and/or Ch/Kc-PEC-based beads to control its release profile in vivo. 
The formulation of VP-loaded beads was optimized using stepwise statistical 
designs based on a prespecified criterion. Several characteristics of the 
prepared beads, such as entrapment efficiency (EE%), in vitro drug release, 
swelling ratio, size and surface microstructure as well as molecular 
interactions between the drug and formulation ingredients, were investigated. In 
vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were carried out using the rabbit model to 
study the ability of the optimized VP-loaded beads to control the absorption 
rate of VP. Results revealed that the prepared superhydrophobic substrates were 
able to fabricate VP-loaded beads with extremely high EE exceeding 90% w/w 
compared to only 27.80% when using conventional ionotropic gelation technique. 
PK results showed that the rate of VP absorption was well controlled following 
oral administration of the optimized beads to six rabbits compared to a marketed 
VP immediate release (IR) tablet, as evidenced by a 2.2-fold increase in mean 
residence time (MRT) and 5.24-fold extension in half value duration (HVD) over 
the marketed product without any observed reduction in the relative oral 
bioavailability.

Increasing life expectancy in the USA makes a better understanding of the 
heterogeneous healthcare needs of the aging population imperative. Many aging 
studies have discovered multimorbid health problems focusing mainly on various 
physical health conditions, but not on combined mental or behavioral health 
problems. There is also a paucity of studies with older adults who use 
professional healthcare services caring for their mental and substance-related 
conditions. This study aims to enhance the knowledge of older peoples' complex 
healthcare needs involving physical, mental, and behavioral conditions; examine 
the relationship between multi-morbid health profiles and specialty healthcare 
service utilization; and investigate its association to poverty. The study data 
were derived from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) in 2013 (n 
= 6296 respondents aged 50 years and older). To identify overall health 
conditions, nine indicators, including physical, mental, and substance/alcohol, 
were included. Healthcare service utilization was measured with four mutually 
exclusive categories: No treatment, mental health treatment only, substance use 
treatment only, and both. We identified four health profiles: Healthy (82%), 
having physical health problems (6%), physical and mental health problems (4%), 
and behavioral problems (8%). Older people's health profiles were differentially 
associated with healthcare use. Those living in poverty with both physical and 
mental health problems or substance/alcohol health problems were less likely to 
receive mental health and substance use treatments than those with more 
financial resources. Implications for geriatric healthcare practices and policy 
are discussed.

To assess the mechanism responsible for the improvement in life expectancy in 
Hong Kong over the past several decades, Arriaga's decomposition method was 
applied to quantify the influence of the age structure and the leading causes of 
death on the increase in life expectancy in Hong Kong from 1986 to 2015. Our 
results showed that, during the observed period, the major contribution to the 
improvement in life expectancy in Hong Kong was attributable to the older 
population for both males and females. Contributions of malignant neoplasms in 
the period of 1986-1995, 1996-2005 and 2006-2015 were 0.613, 0.279 and 0.887 
years in males and 0.391, 0.312 and 0.226 years in females, respectively. For 
circulatory diseases, the corresponding figures were 1.452, 0.202 and 0.832 
years in males and 0.675, 0.192 and 1.069 years in females, with the largest 
contribution also shifting to older ages. However, these positive contributions 
were partly offset by the negative contribution of pneumonia, especially among 
those at advanced ages. Furthermore, although the impact was limited, attention 
should also be paid to the prevalence of some chronic diseases among the younger 
age groups in recent years.

BACKGROUND: Frequent users of emergency medical services (EMS) comprise a 
disproportionate percentage of emergency department (ED) visits. EDs are 
becoming increasingly overwhelmed and a portion of use by frequent callers of 
EMS is potentially avoidable. Social factors contribute to frequent use however 
few studies have examined their prevalence. This study aims to describe social 
isolation/loneliness, poverty, and quality of life in a sample of frequent 
callers of EMS in the Hamilton region, a southern Ontario mid-sized Canadian 
city.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional quantitative study.
METHODS: We surveyed people who called EMS five or more times within 12 months. 
A mailed self-administered survey with validated tools, and focused on four 
major measures: demographic information, social isolation, poverty, and quality 
of life.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven frequent EMS callers revealed that 37-49% were lonely, 14% 
had gone hungry in the preceding month, and 43% had difficulties making ends 
meet at the end of the month. For quality of life, 78% had mobility problems, 
55% had difficulty with self-care, 78% had difficulty with usual activities, 87% 
experienced pain/discomfort, and 67% had anxiety/depression. Overall quality
