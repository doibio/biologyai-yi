BACKGROUND: Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has resulted in an unprecedented 
number of human deaths and economic losses. Analyzing the role of disease in 
different groups of people is useful for determining the burden of disease. As a 
result, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of COVID-19 
on the Saudi Arabian population's quality of life, with a particular emphasis on 
the likely fall in their life expectancy.
METHODS: A cross-sectional and retrospective analysis of 2,988 patients' 
databases was performed to assess COVID-19-induced mortality and complications 
in the community. The data was gathered from official websites that track the 
disease's impact daily between July and October 2021. On the acquired data, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and relative risk analysis were 
performed. The data was statistically analyzed using SPSS IBM 25. The Pearson's 
correlation test was used to examine the relationship between age and disease 
impact. The significance of the findings was determined by using a P value of 
less than 0.05.
RESULTS: The data from the study indicated that the positive test rate, 
infection rate, and mortality rate in the population were 1.84% [+0.11/-0.39 of 
95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.54% (+0.38/-0.52 of CI), and 1.59% (+0.4/-0.7 
of CI), respectively. Highest percentage of mortality was observed in Riyadh 
(17%), followed by Jeddah (8.7%) and Makkah (7.5%). The DALYs/100,000 
inhabitants increased progressively as the age of the population increased, and 
the highest value was found for those over 70 years old (25.73 ± 2.09). 
Similarly, the risk outcome (55%) increased significantly (p = 0.037) from 40 
years onwards, and the maximum was observed at above 70 years (184%, p = 0.006). 
The correlation analysis indicated a significant association (p = 0.032) between 
age and COVID-19 induced mortality from the 40-year-old population onwards.
CONCLUSION: The current study found that the COVID-19 load in Saudi Arabia was 
comparable to that in nations that were said to have performed well during the 
pandemic. DALYs increased from 40 years to 60 years, although people over 60 
years had a lower life expectancy and were more susceptible to infection. After 
60 years, the occurrence of numerous co-morbid illnesses may have added to the 
population's burden of COVID-19. Further research in this area may yield a more 
precise estimate of the COVID-19-induced burden on the entire population.

Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is a life-threatening condition in patients with 
underlying comorbidities. Ear infections may spread through normal skull base 
fissures in this group of patients. However, its diagnosis is frequently delayed 
due to the unspecific clinical findings at onset, such as headache, with diverse 
cranial neuropathies later as the disease progresses. We present the case of a 
patient with otogenic skull base osteomyelitis complicated with retropharyngeal 
extension, treated with surgical drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics 
directed toward extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia 
coli, with recurrence of the infection three months later. With this case study, 
we aim to stress the importance of antimicrobial resistance and how it can 
preclude an otherwise favorable prognosis.

Aim To investigate the reasons for disparity regarding the country-specific 
COVID-19-related case fatality rate (CFR) within the 30 countries of the 
European Economic Area (EEA). Materials and methods Data regarding population, 
area, COVID-19-associated infections/deaths, vaccination, life expectancy, 
elderly population, infant mortality, gender disparity, urbanization, gross 
domestic product (GDP), income per capita, health spending per capita, 
physicians, nursing personnel, hospital beds, ICU beds, hypertension, diabetes, 
obesity, and smoking from all EEA countries were collected from official sources 
on January 16, 2022. Correlation coefficients were computed, and optimal scaling 
using ridge regression was used to reach the most parsimonious multivariate 
model assessing any potential independent correlation of public health 
parameters with COVID-19 CFR. Results COVID-19 CFR ranges from 0.1% (Iceland) to 
4.0% (Bulgaria). All parameters but population density, GDP, total health 
spending (% of GDP), ICU beds, diabetes, and obesity were correlated with 
COVID-19 CFR. In the most parsimonious multivariate model, elderly population 
rate (P = 0.018), males/total ratio (P = 0.013), nurses/hospital beds (P = 
0.001), physicians/hospital beds (P = 0.026), public health spending (P = 
0.013), smoking rate (P = 0.013), and unvaccinated population rate (P = 0.00005) 
were demonstrated to present independent correlation with COVID-19 CFR. In 
detail, the COVID-19 CFR is estimated to increase by 1.24 times in countries 
with vaccination rate of <0.34, 1.11 times in countries with an elderly 
population rate of ≥0.20, 1.14 times in countries with male ratio values ≥0.493, 
1.12 times in countries spending <2,000$ annually per capita for public health, 
1.14 and 1.10 times in countries with <2.30 nurses and <0.88 physicians per 
hospital bed, respectively, and 1.12 in countries with smoking ratio ≥0.22, 
while holding all other independent variables of the model constant. Conclusion 
COVID-19 CFR varies substantially among EEA countries and is independently 
linked with low vaccination rates, increased elderly population rate, diminished 
public health spending per capita, insufficient physicians and nursing personnel 
per hospital bed, and prevalent smoking habits. Therefore, public health 
authorities are awaited to consider these parameters in prioritizing actions to 
manage the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Advances in medicine and technology that have made it possible to 
support, repair, or replace failing organs challenge commonly held notions of 
life and death. The objective of this review is to develop a comprehensive 
description of the current understandings of the public regarding the 
meaning/definition and determination of death.
METHODS: This scoping review was conducted in compliance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews checklist. Online databases were used to identify articles published 
from 2003 to 2021. Two reviewers (S.S. and K.Z.) screened the articles using 
predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data for specific content 
variables, and performed descriptive examination. Complementary searches of 
reference lists complemented the final study selection. A search strategy using 
vocabulary of the respective databases was created, and criteria for the 
inclusion and exclusion of the articles were established.
RESULTS: Seven thousand four hundred twenty-eight references were identified. 
Sixty were retained for analysis, with 4 additional references added from 
complementary searches. A data extraction instrument was developed to 
iteratively chart the results. A qualitative approach was conducted to 
thematically analyze the data. Themes included public understanding/attitudes 
toward death and determination of death (neurological determination and 
cardiocirculatory determination of death), death and organ donation, public 
trust and legal variability, and media impacts.
CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a current and comprehensive overview of the 
literature related to the general public's understanding and attitudes toward 
death and death determination and serves to highlight the gaps in this topic.

In recent years the focus of healthcare and nutritional science in older adults 
has shifted from mortality towards physical performance and quality of life. The 
aim of this review was to summarize observational studies on physical 
performance in malnourished (MN) or at risk of malnutrition (RMN) older adults 
compared with well-nourished (WN) older adults. Eligible studies had to report 
on nutritional status and objectively measured physical performance in older 
adults (≥60 y). MN or RMN groups had to be compared with a WN group, measured 
with a validated nutrition screener. Ovid Medline and Web of Science were 
searched until 13 November, 2020. Study quality was scored using a modified 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results were analyzed by meta-analysis when 
possible, or narratively reviewed otherwise. Forty-five studies (16,911 
participants in total) were included from studies in outpatient clinics (n = 6), 
nursing homes (n = 3), community-dwelling older adults (n = 20), hospitalized 
patients (n = 15), or a combination (n = 1). Studies used 11 different screeners 
of malnutrition, and 8 types of physical performance measures. Meta-analysis 
showed that compared with MN, WN groups had better hand grip strength (mean 
difference [MD] = 4.92 kg; 95% CI: 3.43, 6.41; P < 0.001; n = 23), faster gait 
speed (MD = 0.16 m/s; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.27; P = 0.0033; n = 7), performed faster 
on timed-up-and-go (MD = -5.94 s; 95% CI: -8.98, -2.89; P < 0.001; n = 8), and 
scored 1.2 more short physical performance battery points (95% CI: 1.32, 2.73; P 
< 0.001; n = 6). Results were less pronounced when compared with RMN. 
Narratively, all studies showed an association for knee extension strength, 
6-min walking test, and multicomponent tests, except for the chair stand test. 
Study limitations include no studies scoring "good" on NOS, lack of confounder 
adjustment, and high heterogeneity. Overall, evidence from cross-sectional 
studies indicate an association between malnutrition and worse physical 
performance in older adults. This study is registered in PROSPERO as 
CRD42020192893.

The fusarium toxin 2-amino-14,16-dimethyloctadecan-3-ol (2-AOD-3-ol) is 
characterized as a sphingolipid analogue that can be isolated from Fusarium 
avenaceum-infected crops and fruits. In the current study, we discovered a group 
of novel metabolites of 2-AOD-3-ol from the F. avenaceum-fermented rice culture. 
2-AOD-3-ol was predominantly present as a C16:1 fatty acid-assembled 
ceramide-mimic form rather than as a free base. Although 2-AOD-3-ol and its 
fatty acyl derivatives were barely detected in fresh samples, the contents of 
these fusarium toxins accumulated with the extension of storage time up to 
approximately 32-50 mg/kg dry weight in naturally stored rice, grapes, apples, 
and oranges. Our finding provides insight into the quality and safety of food 
during storage through a novel aspect: the C14-C24 fatty acyl 2-AOD-3-ol in 
nature, which calls for further studies to address their potential impact on 
human health.

AIMS: Given the high rate of adverse events and high cost of adjuvant 
chemotherapy, it is optimal to avoid its use when endocrine therapy is equally 
effective at preventing distant recurrence of early breast cancer. The Oncotype 
DX test is a predictive and prognostic multigene assay used to guide adjuvant 
chemotherapy decisions in early breast cancer based on a Recurrence Score (RS) 
result. A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis compared the Oncotype DX test 
to clinical risk tools alone for HR+/HER2- node-positive (1-3 axillary lymph 
nodes) early breast cancer patients based on results from the RxPONDER trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-tree and Markov model was developed in 
Microsoft Excel. Distributions of patients and distant recurrence probabilities 
with endocrine and chemo-endocrine therapy were derived from the RxPONDER trial, 
TransATAC and SWOG-8814. Chemotherapy assignment data were obtained from the 
Clalit registry. The cost of adjuvant chemotherapy was based on the distribution 
of treatments used in the UK combined with published drug unit costs in the UK. 
The cost of distant recurrence and health state utility values were obtained 
from literature.
RESULTS: The Oncotype DX test was found to be more effective (with an estimated 
0.02 additional QALYs) at a lower estimated cost (-£989) compared to clinical 
risk tools alone. The results did not substantially change with more 
conservative clinical and cost scenarios. The RxPONDER trial was restricted to 
RS 0-25, and data synthesis with other studies was required to inform the 
analysis, which increased uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: The Oncotype DX test is highly likely to be cost-effective in 
node-positive early breast cancer. The results were driven by reduction in the 
use of chemotherapy with consequence avoidance of the costs and harmful effects 
of chemotherapy. Targeted treatment of a minority (11%) of women with RS 26-100 
who benefit from chemotherapy reduced cost and improved survival.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Long-term durability and functional outcome of 
laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy (LSH) remains to be confirmed. We set out to 
assess the development of surgical outcome in women with increasing minimal 
follow-up.
METHODS: All women after LSH with anterior and posterior mesh extension operated 
for advanced apical uterine prolapse at Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire clinic from July 
2005 to June 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Last known 
follow-up information was used for the analysis and allocation into groups. The 
surgical success was defined as no prolapse beyond hymen, no symptomatic 
recurrence or no retreatment. Functional outcome was evaluated from validated 
questionnaires and presence of pelvic floor disorders. The outcomes were 
compared with preoperative state using chi-square and Fisher's test; p < 0.05 
was considered significant.
RESULTS: In total, 270 patients after LSH with a follow-up of up to 14.5 years 
were enrolled and divided into groups according to their last follow-up length: 
≥ 1 year 242, ≥ 3 years 112, ≥ 5 years 76, ≥ 7 years 45 and ≥ 10 years 18 women. 
Increase of minimal follow-up was associated with gradual decrease in surgical 
success. Rates of stress urinary incontinence were unchanged by the surgery, 
while anal incontinence and constipation rates decreased significantly; 14.5% of 
women were operated on for SUI in the follow-up. The PFDI-20, PFIQ-7 and VAS 
bother scores decreased significantly regardless of minimal follow-up length.
CONCLUSIONS: LSH with anterior and posterior mesh extension is a safe, effective 
and durable surgery with a positive long-term effect on quality of life. 
Although the surgical success gradually decreases, LSH remains a surgical 
success in most women.

Many people around the world suffer from some form of paralysis caused by spinal 
cord injury (SCI), which has an impact on quality and life expectancy. The 
spinal cord is part of the central nervous system (CNS), which in mammals is 
unable to regenerate, and to date, there is a lack of full functional recovery 
therapies for SCI. These injuries start with a rapid and mechanical insult, 
followed by a secondary phase leading progressively to greater damage. This 
secondary phase can be potentially modifiable through targeted therapies. The 
growing literature, derived from mammalian and regenerative model studies, 
supports a leading role for mitochondria in every cellular response after SCI: 
mitochondrial dysfunction is the common event of different triggers leading to 
cell death, cellular metabolism regulates the immune response, mitochondrial 
number and localization correlate with axon regenerative capacity, while 
mitochondrial abundance and substrate utilization regulate neural stem 
progenitor cells self-renewal and differentiation. Herein, we present a 
comprehensive review of the cellular responses during the secondary phase of 
SCI, the mitochondrial contribution to each of them, as well as evidence of 
mitochondrial involvement in spinal cord regeneration, suggesting that a more 
in-depth study of mitochondrial function and regulation is needed to identify 
potential targets for SCI therapeutic intervention.

We report the efficacy of a Japanese fracture liaison service (FLS), the 
osteoporosis liaison service (OLS), in suppressing osteoporosis-related expenses 
from the public insurance by preventing secondary fracture in spite of higher 
medication costs during expected life spans. OLS could reduce medical expenses 
for osteoporosis in all age groups.
PURPOSE: Osteoporosis liaison services (OLS), which are based on fracture 
liaison services (FLS), are used in Japan to prevent both primary and secondary 
fractures in older people. We aimed to clarify the effects of OLS on the medical 
expenses.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared patients with fragile fractures hospitalized 
to Saitama Jikei Hospital before and after implementing OLS. These were labeled 
a non-OLS group and an OLS group, and they were further organized by age (< 75, 
75-84, and ≥ 85 years). The expected osteoporosis-related medical expenses 
during life were calculated by the occurrence, fracture site, medication, and 
life expectancy and compared between the non-OLS and OLS groups by the age 
group.
RESULTS: The non-OLS group included 400 people (100 males and 300 females, mean 
age 81.7 ± 9.7 years), comprising 154 with vertebral fractures and 246 with hip 
fractures. The OLS group included 406 patients (101 males and 305 females, mean 
age 82.4 ± 9.3 years), of whom 161 had vertebral fractures and 245 had hip 
fractures. The suppressive secondary fracture effects of OLS were previously 
reported. The expected expense of osteoporosis treatment in the OLS group was 
found to be greater than that in the non-OLS group for all age groups. In 
contrast, expected expenses for treating secondary fractures were shown to 
increase more in the non-OLS group. However, total expenses were lower in the 
OLS group across all age groups.
CONCLUSION: The implementation of OLS can reduce overall healthcare costs 
despite the increased expenses required to provide medical therapy and periodic

With growing life expectancy, the prevalence of frailty and sarcopenia will 
continuously increase during the next decades. Geographical differences have 
been described, and depending on the population studied, sarcopenia is evident 
in 10% of community-dwelling people, increasing up to 40 to 50% among those 
living in nursing homes. Sarcopenia is a complex age-related process of 
multifactorial pathogenesis, influenced by lifestyle, nutrition, biological 
processes during aging, and also immunological and endocrine mechanisms. For 
diagnostic criteria, physical parameters (muscle mass measurement) and 
functional aspects (muscle strength, gait speed, physical performance) are 
required. In routine clinical care, screening patients using the SARC‑F 
questionnaire is recommended by recent guidelines of the European Workgroup for 
Sarcopenia.

INTRODUCTION: Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic 
macular oedema (DME), and macular oedema due to central retinal vein occlusion 
(CRVO) are leading causes of vision loss, currently managed with anti-vascular 
endothelial growth factor injections (anti-VEGF). The aim of this study was to 
calculate QALYs in patients with nAMD, DME, and CRVO treated with anti-VEGF 
agents (QALYs+) in a Greek tertiary hospital setting and compare them to 
theoretical QALYs that the patients would have without treatment (QALYs-).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 143 treatment-naive patients with 
macular oedema due to nAMD (n = 79), DME (n = 57), and CRVO (n = 7), who 
received anti-VEGF injections as monotherapy according to the Treat-and-Extend 
(T&E) protocol. The anti-VEGF agents were ranibizumab and aflibercept in 
equivalent fractions. QALYs where calculated by the formula QALY = Utility Value 
× Time, where "Time" refers to the follow-up period of the study. For QALYs-, we 
assumed that visual acuity remained unchanged during this period.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 1.3 ± 1.2 years in the nAMD group, 
1 ± 1.3 years in the DME group, and 0.5 ± 1 years in the CRVO group. There was 
no statistically significant difference between QALYs- and QALYs+ in all three 
ocular pathologies for the study period (p > 0.05 for each of the three 
statistical tests performed).
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Possible explanations for the lack of significant 
difference between QALYs - and QALYs + in nAMD, DME, and CRVO groups, may be the 
short time horizon used in this analysis, the inclusion of data from the 
better-seeing eye (BSE) and the specific socio-economic, geographical and health 
care characteristics of this rural Greek area.

INTRODUCTION: Quarantine protocols for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic has modified orthodontic appointments.
OBJECTIVE: to evaluate self-reported experience and needs of orthodontic 
patients during the quarantine period without in-person appointments.
METHODS: Thirty patients, aged 8 to 21 years, under active orthodontic treatment 
were randomly selected. A phone call questionnaire including questions on 
physical and emotional impacts of the quarantine of COVID-19 was applied during 
the second month of Brazilian quarantine.
RESULTS: Sixteen percent of the patients reported pain related to the 
orthodontic appliance. Appliance breakage was observed in 23.33%. Twenty percent 
felt the need of an emergency orthodontic appointment and 3.33% visited a 
private practice. Moreover, 23% reported that even in an emergency need, they 
would not search for an appointment, preferring to communicate with the 
orthodontist by WhatsApp. Oral hygiene self-perception status showed improvement 
in 36.67% and worsening in 6.67% of the patients, while 56.66% reported 
maintenance of the same hygiene status. Sixty percent were concerned about the 
orthodontic treatment. General concerns were primary related to health and a 
possible extension of the quarantine time.
CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 quarantine, orthodontic patients demonstrated a low 
frequency of orthodontic appliance interference in daily life, and most of them 
reported a maintenance of oral hygiene habits. The frequency of appliance 
related pain and breakage was 16.67% and 23.33%, respectively. Patients' main 
concern during the quarantine period was the fear of getting sick and the 
uncertainness about the extension of the quarantine period.

INTRODUÇÃO: As medidas de quarentena para a pandemia da doença coronavírus 2019 
(COVID-19) modificaram as consultas ortodônticas.
OBJETIVO: O objetivo desse estudo foi avaliar as experiências e necessidades 
autorreferidas dos pacientes ortodônticos durante o período de quarentena sem 
consulta ortodôntica presencial.
MÉTODOS: Trinta pacientes, com idades entre 8 e 21 anos, em tratamento 
ortodôntico ativo, foram selecionados aleatoriamente. Um questionário com 
perguntas relacionadas aos impactos físicos e emocionais durante a quarentena de 
COVID-19 foi aplicado durante o segundo mês de quarentena brasileira, por meio 
de ligações telefônicas.
RESULTADOS: Dezesseis por cento dos pacientes referiram dor relacionada ao 
aparelho ortodôntico, e a quebra do aparelho foi observada em 23,33%. Vinte por 
cento sentiram necessidade de consulta ortodôntica de emergência, 3,33% 
procuraram atenção particular e 23% disseram que, mesmo diante de uma emergência 
ortodôntica, não procurariam atenção particular e prefeririam se comunicar com o 
ortodontista pelo WhatsApp. A autopercepção do estado de higiene bucal 
apresentou melhora em 36,67% e piora em 6,67% dos pacientes, enquanto 56,66% 
relataram manutenção do mesmo estado de higiene. Sessenta por cento estavam 
preocupados com o tratamento ortodôntico. As preocupações gerais estavam 
relacionadas com a saúde e uma possível extensão do tempo de quarentena.
CONCLUSÕES: Durante a quarentena de COVID-19, os pacientes ortodônticos 
demonstraram baixa frequência de interferência do aparelho ortodôntico no dia a 
dia, e a maioria relatou manutenção dos hábitos de higiene bucal. A frequência 
de dor relacionada ao aparelho e de quebra do aparelho foi de 16,67% e 23,33%, 
respectivamente. A principal preocupação dos pacientes durante o período de 
quarentena era ficar doente, além do medo de uma extensão do período de 
quarentena.

Changes in Life Expectancy Between 2019 and 2020 in the US and 21 Peer 
Countries.

IMPORTANCE: Prior studies reported that US life expectancy decreased 
considerably in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with estimates suggesting 
that the decreases were much larger among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black 
populations than non-Hispanic White populations. Studies based on provisional 
data suggested that other high-income countries did not experience the large 
decrease in life expectancy observed in the US; this study sought to confirm 
these findings according to official death counts and to broaden the pool of 
comparison countries.
OBJECTIVE: To calculate changes in US life expectancy between 2019 and 2020 by 
sex, race, and ethnicity and to compare those outcomes with changes in other 
high-income countries.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study involved a 
simulation of life tables based on national death and population counts for the 
US and 21 other high-income countries in 2019 and 2020, by sex, including an 
analysis of US outcomes by race and ethnicity. Data were analyzed in January 
2022.
EXPOSURES: Official death counts from the US and 21 peer countries.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth and credible range (CR) 
based on 10% uncertainty.
RESULTS: Between 2019 and 2020, US life expectancy decreased by a mean of 1.87 
years (CR, 1.70-2.03 years), with much larger decreases occurring in the 
Hispanic (3.70 years; CR, 3.53-3.87 years) and non-Hispanic Black (3.22 years; 
CR, 3.03-3.40 years) populations than in the non-Hispanic White population (1.38 
years; CR, 1.21-1.54 years). The mean decrease in life expectancy among peer 
countries was 0.58 years (CR, 0.42-0.73 year) across all 21 countries. No peer 
country experienced decreases as large as those seen in the US.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Official death counts confirm that US life expectancy 
decreased between 2019 and 2020 on a scale not seen in 21 peer countries, 
substantially widening the preexisting gap in life expectancy between the US and 
peer countries. The decrease in US life expectancy was experienced 
disproportionately by Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations, consistent 
with a larger history of racial and ethnic health inequities resulting from 
policies of exclusion and systemic racism. Policies to address the systemic 
causes of the US health disadvantage relative to peer countries and persistent 
racial and ethnic inequities are essential.

BACKGROUND: Social status gradients are powerful health determinants for 
individuals living in poverty. We tested whether winning an Academy award 
(Oscar) for acting was associated with long-term survival.
METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of all actors and actresses 
nominated for an Academy award in a leading or a supporting role. For each, a 
control was identified based on age, sex, and co-staring in the same film.
RESULTS: Overall, 2,111 individuals were analyzed with 1,122 total deaths 
occurring during a median follow-up of 68.8 years. Comparisons of winners to 
controls yielded a 4.8% relative difference average life-span (95% confidence 
interval: 1.6 to 7.9, p = 0.004), a 5.1 year absolute increase in life 
expectancy (95% confidence interval: 3.0 to 7.2, p < 0.001), and a 41% 
improvement in mortality hazard (95% confidence interval: 19 to 68, p < 0.001). 
The increased survival tended to be greater in recent years, for individuals 
winning at a younger age, and among those with multiple wins. The increased 
survival replicated in secondary analyses comparing winners to nominees and was 
not observed in analyses comparing nominees to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Academy award winning actors and actresses show a positive 
association between success and survival, suggesting the importance of 
behavioral, psychological, or other modifiable health factors unrelated to 
poverty.

The purpose of the work was to demonstrate that an early stage diagnosis of the 
interstitial lung disease would allow establishing the proper treatment course 
and as a result, increase life expectancy and quality in patients with this 
disorder. More than 200 acute and chronic conditions with inflammatory and 
fibroproliperative changes comprise the group of diffuse lung diseases. 
Definitive diagnosis cannot be made based on chest X-ray only. Diffuse lung 
disease (DLD) is difficult to differentiate from bacterial lung diseases, such 
as pneumonia and tuberculosis, which frequently results in incorrect treatment, 
disease progression and poor outcome. All of the these factors emphasize the 
importance of the issue of differential diagnosis. Professionals especially pay 
attention to idiopathic forms of diffuse lung disease, which is characterized 
with severe clinical course and poor prognosis due to progressive fibrous 
processes. The right method of approach is to rule out more common conditions, 
such as infectious diseases of lungs, structural abnormalities of the 
respiratory airway, immune deficiencies, congenital heart diseases, cystic 
fibrosis. Thus, DLD is a diagnostic challenge for pediatricians and 
pulmonologists. Article presents the case report of 4-month old infant with DLD 
that was analyzed according to the diagnostic and management approach. It 
includes anamnesis, clinical and diagnostic criteria of the disease, established 
by multiple studies, different methods of treatment, outcome and 
recommendations.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) has 
improved considerably since the introduction of rituximab. This study examined 
the proportion of deaths from progressive lymphoma and the impact of FL on 
survival compared with that in the general population.
METHODS: Altogether, 749 patients with grades 1 and 2 FL in 9 institutions 
between 1997 and 2016 were enrolled. Competing risk models were used to estimate 
the cumulative incidences of deaths from progressive lymphoma and from other 
reasons. Excess mortality was analyzed with respect to the corresponding 
background populations standardized for age and sex using the excess mortality 
model based on the penalized spline approach.
RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 69 months (range, 0-226 months). The 
estimated 10-year overall, disease-specific, and net survival rates were 72.4%, 
86.6%, and 86.4%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of deaths from 
progressive lymphoma was slightly smaller than that of other causes in the study 
population (estimated 10-year cumulative incidences: 12.3% [95% CI, 9.6%-15.3%] 
and 15.4% [95% CI, 12.2%-18.8%], respectively). Excess mortality was observed 
for up to 10 years after diagnosis, and it slightly increased with time.
CONCLUSIONS: Deaths from progressive lymphoma are nearly as common as deaths 
from other causes in FL patients during the rituximab era. Despite the 
improvements in survival, there was evidence of excess mortality resulting from 
FL for at least 10 years after diagnosis.

of subjective life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: One of the effective ways to control hypertension is long-term 
self-management, which is difficult to maintain. Therefore, understanding how 
people engage in the process of self-management behaviour change is necessary. 
In this study, we aimed to examine the dynamic relationship between 
self-perceived disease control and self-management behaviours in Chinese 
middle-aged and older hypertensive patients, namely, medication use, 
self-monitoring, physical activity, tobacco and alcohol avoidance, and to 
explore the mediating role of subjective life expectancy (SLE) on this 
relationship.
METHODS: Data were obtained from a nationally representative sample of 508 
middle-aged and older hypertensive patients (aged 45+) from the 2013, 2015, and 
2018 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. A cross-lagged 
panel model combined with mediation analysis was used to determine the dynamic 
relationship between self-perceived disease control and self-management 
behaviours and to clarify the mediating effect of SLE on this ascertained 
relationship.
RESULTS: Good self-perceived disease control subsequently predicted good 
medication use, self-monitoring and physical activity, and vice versa. 
Subjective life expectancy (SLE) partially mediated the prospective reciprocal 
relationships between self-perceived disease control and these self-management 
behaviours, which accounted for 37.11, 25.88, and 19.39% of the total effect of 
self-perceived disease control on medication use, self-monitoring and physical 
activity, respectively. These self-management behaviours had a significant and 
positive feedback effect on self-perceived disease control. However, neither the 
direct and indirect effects (via SLE) of self-perceived disease control on 
tobacco and alcohol avoidance were revealed.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive feedback loops of present self-perceived disease control, 
future SLE and self-management behaviours (medication use, self-monitoring, and 
physical activity) help middle-aged and older hypertensive patients adhere to 
these behaviours but are useless for the avoidance of addictive behaviours. 
Interventions aimed at enhancing the effect perception of general 
self-management behaviours (e.g., medication use, self-monitoring and physical 
activity) on the present disease control perspective, and future lifespan 
perspective would be beneficial for the consistent self-management behaviours of 
middle-aged and older hypertensive patients. The utility of present disease 
control perception to these self-management behaviours was much higher than the 
utility of future expectations. Alternative stress relief strategies may be 
conducive to long-term changes in addictive behaviours.

Humans communicate with each other through language, which enables us talk about 
things beyond time and space. Do non-human animals learn to associate human 
speech with specific objects in everyday life? We examined whether cats matched 
familiar cats' names and faces (Exp.1) and human family members' names and faces 
(Exp.2). Cats were presented with a photo of the familiar cat's face on a laptop 
monitor after hearing the same cat's name or another cat's name called by the 
subject cat's owner (Exp.1) or an experimenter (Exp.2). Half of the trials were 
in a congruent condition where the name and face matched, and half were in an 
incongruent (mismatch) condition. Results of Exp.1 showed that household cats 
paid attention to the monitor for longer in the incongruent condition, 
suggesting an expectancy violation effect; however, café cats did not. In Exp.2, 
cats living in larger human families were found to look at the monitor for 
increasingly longer durations in the incongruent condition. Furthermore, this 
tendency was stronger among cats that had lived with their human family for a 
longer time, although we could not rule out an effect of age. This study 
provides evidence that cats link a companion's name and corresponding face 
without explicit training.
