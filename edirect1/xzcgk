DOK7 congenital myasthenic syndrome (DOK7-CMS) generally presents early in life 
and is treated with salbutamol or ephedrine. This report describes an atypical 
case of a 39-year-old woman who presented with proximal upper limb weakness in 
the third trimester of pregnancy and was initially diagnosed with seronegative 
myasthenia gravis. Dramatic clinical worsening under pyridostigmine and further 
inefficacy of steroids, intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma 
exchange (PLEX) led to the presumptive diagnosis of a CMS. Initially, a 
slow-channel CMS was regarded as more probable due to prominent finger extension 
weakness. Accordingly, fluoxetine was started and a lengthy improvement was 
seen. Clinical deterioration occurred after fluoxetine withdrawal, when a 
c.1124_1127dup homozygous mutation was detected in DOK7 gene. Afterwards, 
salbutamol was started and the patient became asymptomatic. This case highlights 
the importance of considering CMS before an adult-onset myasthenic syndrome and 
suggests a benefit from fluoxetine not previously reported in DOK7-CMS.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm which may lead 
to stroke, heart failure, and death. Emergency physicians play a role in 
diagnosing AF, managing symptoms, and lessening complications from this 
dysrhythmia.
OBJECTIVE: This review evaluates recent literature and addresses ED 
considerations in the management of AF.
DISCUSSION: Emergency physicians should first assess patient clinical stability 
and evaluate and treat reversible causes. Immediate cardioversion is indicated 
in the hemodynamically unstable patient. The American Heart Association/American 
College of Cardiology, the European Society of Cardiology, and the Canadian 
Cardiovascular Society provide recommendations for management of AF. If 
hemodynamically stable, rate or rhythm control are options for management of AF. 
Physicians may opt for rate control with medications, with beta blockers and 
calcium channel blockers the predominant medications utilized in the ED. 
Patients with intact left ventricular function should be rate controlled to <110 
beats per minute. Rhythm control is an option for patients who possess longer 
life expectancy and those with AF onset <48 h before presentation, 
anticoagulated for 3-4 weeks, or with transesophageal echocardiography 
demonstrating no intracardiac thrombus. Direct oral anticoagulants are a safe 
and reliable option for anticoagulation. Clinical judgment regarding disposition 
is recommended, but literature supports discharging stable patients who do not 
have certain comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: Proper diagnosis and treatment of AF is essential to reduce 
complications. Treatment and overall management of AF include rate or rhythm 
control, cardioversion, anticoagulation, and admission versus discharge. This 
review discusses ED considerations regarding AF management.

Since the beginning of electron microscopy, resolution has been a critical 
parameter. In this article, we propose a fully automatic, accurate method for 
determining the local resolution of a 3D map (MonoRes). The foundation of this 
algorithm is an extension of the concept of analytic signal, termed monogenic 
signal. The map is filtered at different frequencies and the amplitude of the 
monogenic signal is calculated, after which a criterion is applied to determine 
the resolution at each voxel. MonoRes is fully automatic without compulsory user 
parameters, with great accuracy in all tests, and is computationally more rapid 
than existing methods in the field. In addition, MonoRes offers the option of 
local filtering of the original map based on the calculated local resolution.

INTRODUCTION: This study examines the role of educational attainment, an 
indicator of cognitive reserve, on transitions in later life between cognitive 
states (normal Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), mild MMSE impairment, and 
severe MMSE impairment) and death.
METHODS: Analysis of six international longitudinal studies was performed using 
a coordinated approach. Multistate survival models were used to estimate the 
transition patterns via different cognitive states. Life expectancies were 
estimated.
RESULTS: Across most studies, a higher level of education was associated with a 
lower risk of transitioning from normal MMSE to mild MMSE impairment but was not 
associated with other transitions. Those with higher levels of education and 
socioeconomic status had longer nonimpaired life expectancies.
DISCUSSION: This study highlights the importance of education in later life and 
that early life experiences can delay later compromised cognitive health. This 
study also demonstrates the feasibility and benefit in conducting coordinated 
analysis across multiple studies to validate findings.

Life expectancy has been steadily increasing for decades and this trend is 
likely to continue in coming years. In fact, there is more than a 50% 
probability that by 2030 female life expectancy could break the 90 year barrier, 
with more than half of the expected gains due to enhanced longevity above the 
age of 65 years. The resultant aging of societies means that health care will be 
faced with a rising number of increasingly older patients, who are also likely 
to have higher levels of multimorbidity. Most issues regarding assessment, 
prognostication and, management of older patients are not unique to geriatric 
oncology and thus there is opportunity to learn from progress in other fields. 
The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on research, reviews, and 
debate in general geriatrics that may be relevant to clinicians and researchers 
active in geriatric oncology. The selection of topics was based on a general 
search of the table of contents of widely read geriatrics and internal medicine 
journals, and includes geriatric co-management, improving research for older 
patients, caregiver issues, eliciting patient preferences, and shared-decision 
making.

PURPOSE: New direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs have revolutionized the 
treatment of hepatitis C in recent years.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to analyse the cost effectiveness of combinations 
of different DAAs compared with ribavirin and peginterferon-α-2a, taking into 
account rebates from tender negotiations.
METHODS: We used a compartmental model specifically developed for Norway to 
simulate hepatitis C and complications with and without different DAAs. All 
costs were based on Norwegian fees and estimates, estimating healthcare sector 
costs for the year 2016. We performed Monte Carlo simulations on uncertain input 
parameters to facilitate probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: For patients diagnosed with genotype 1, the combination of 
paritaprevir, ritonavir, ombitasvir and dasabuvir was cost effective compared 
with eight other available alternatives, given a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
€70,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. For genotype 2, the combination of 
sofosbuvir and ribavirin was the most effective and cost-effective alternative 
for all patients. Among available alternatives for patients with genotype 3, 
sofosbuvir in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin was the most 
cost-effective alternative, although the combination of daclatasvir and 
sofosbuvir was somewhat more effective.
CONCLUSIONS: For each of the hepatitis C genotypes 1, 2 and 3, there were 
combinations of DAAs that were cost effective in a Norwegian setting. As a 
result of recent tender negotiations in Norway, treating all diagnosed patients 
with hepatitis C with the most cost-effective DAAs will result in lower total 
expenditure on these medications compared with 2015.

Background Providing care for chronic disease such as HIV is a growing challenge 
in the world. In order to address the challenges of linkage and care in chronic 
disease management, we need to identify factors that can influence people to get 
more involved in self-care. This study was part of an extensive qualitative 
study conducted in Tehran, Iran in 2016. Methods The data were collected through 
semi-structured interviews conducted on 25 women with HIV, and were analyzed 
using grounded theory. Four main themes were identified as facilitating 
self-care among participants: health system support, clinicians' support, family 
support and improved life expectancy. Sub-themes that emerged were free HIV 
tests; free medication; free membership in positive clubs; free psychological 
consultation; positive attitudes and friendly behavior from clinic staff; 
telephone follow up; support from husbands, mothers and peers; hope for 
recovery; hope for the future; and love for own children. Results Our results 
showed that, providing appropriate support and services, as well as a positive 
attitude of society towards HIV positive women, can contribute to adherence to 
self-care in young women with HIV. Conclusion Understanding the facilitating 
factors based on the patients' experiences can contribute to the development of 
new policies and procedures to improve the care of these patients.

OBJECTIVES: To measure the effectiveness of ovarian cancer screening using the 
Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA).
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed based on the UK Collaborative Trial of 
Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS). This model was used to predict the outcome 
of ovarian cancer screening with ROCA.
RESULTS: The model predicted the ovarian cancer mortality from age 50 to age 85 
to be 0.954% with a decrease in life expectancy of 0.178years (yrs) per person. 
Using data from the UKCTOCS the model predicted a similar reduction in mortality 
(11% vs. 10%), and similar curves for ovarian cancer mortality. Screening at age 
50 for 20yrs reduced ovarian cancer mortality from 0.953% to 0.898%, an absolute 
decrease of 6%, yielding an increase in life expectancy of 0.0101yrs, preventing 
55 deaths per 100,000 screened at a cost of $585,946 per life-yr. Screening for 
30yrs reduced mortality from 0.954% to 0.872%, an absolute decrease of 9%, 
preventing 82 deaths at a cost of $763,970 per life-yr.
CONCLUSION: The ROCA test can improve the detection of early ovarian cancer but 
is not practical for screening in an average-risk population. We predict the 
ROCA test will reduce overall ovarian cancer mortality by 6% to 9% but at a 
substantial cost. For ROCA to be practical, the cost would need to be reduced 
ten-fold and would have only a marginal impact on mortality from ovarian cancer. 
This model supports the FDA's criticism of the ROCA test. Ovarian cancer 
screening may reduce mortality from ovarian cancer but is not cost effective.

    J Cyst Fibros. 2018 Mar;17(2):133-134.

Survival statistics, estimated using data collected by national cystic fibrosis 
(CF) patient registries, are used to inform the CF community and monitor 
survival of CF populations. Annual registry reports typically give the median 
age of survival, though different registries use different estimation approaches 
and terminology, which has created confusion for the community. In this article 
we explain how median age of survival is estimated, what its interpretation is, 
and what assumptions and limitations are involved. Information on survival from 
birth is less useful for individuals who have already reached a certain age and 
we propose use of conditional survivor curves to address this. We provide 
recommendations for CF registries with the aim of facilitating clear and 
consistent reporting of survival statistics. Our recommendations are illustrated 
using data from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases in patients with cystic fibrosis, it is 
important to pay attention to extra-pulmonary comorbidities. Several studies 
have shown signs of myocardial dysfunction in adult patients, but little is 
known about onset and development of these changes over time. In this 
prospective study, cardiac function in children with cystic fibrosis was 
compared to that of healthy children.
METHODS: 33 children, aged 3-12years, with cystic fibrosis were recruited from 
the Wilhelmina Children's hospital and 33 age-matched healthy children were 
selected from the WHISTLER study, a population-based cohort study. Measurements 
of lung function, arterial stiffness, and echocardiography (conventional 
measures and myocardial deformation imaging) were performed.
RESULTS: There were no differences in anthropometrics, lung function and blood 
pressure between the two groups. The cystic fibrosis children had a higher 
arterial stiffness compared to the healthy children (pulse wave velocity 
respectively 5.76±0.57m/s versus 5.43±0.61m/s, p-value 0.049). Using 
conventional echocardiographic parameters for right ventricular function, 
Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion) and Tissue Doppler Imaging, cystic 
fibrosis children had a reduced right ventricular systolic function when 
compared to the healthy children. After adjustment for lung function, global 
strains of both right and left ventricles were significantly lower in the cystic 
fibrosis group than in healthy children (linear regression coefficient 1.45% 
left ventricle, p-value 0.022 and 4.42% right ventricle, p-value <0.01). 
Systolic strain rate of basal segment of the left ventricle, the mid segment of 
the right ventricle and the apical septum were significantly lower in the cystic 
fibrosis children than in healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that already at a very young age, children with 
cystic fibrosis show an increased arterial stiffness and some signs of 
diminished both right and left ventricular function.

Cost-Effectiveness of Ibrutinib Compared With Obinutuzumab With Chlorambucil in 
Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients With Comorbidities in the United 
Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib shows superiority over obinutuzumab with chlorambucil 
(G-Clb) in untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia with 
comorbidities who cannot tolerate fludarabine-based therapy. However, ibrutinib 
is relatively more expensive than G-Clb. In this study we evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of ibrutinib compared with G-Clb from the United Kingdom (UK) 
health care perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3-state semi-Markov model was parameterized to estimate 
the lifetime costs and benefits associated with ibrutinib compared with G-Clb as 
first-line treatment. Idelalisib with rituximab was considered as second-line 
treatment. Unit costs were derived from standard sources, (dis)utilities from UK 
elicitation studies, progression-free survival, progression, and death from 
clinical trials, and postprogression survival and background mortality from 
published sources. Additional analyses included threshold analyses with 
ibrutinib and idelalisib at various discount rates, and scenario analysis with 
ibrutinib as second-line treatment after G-Clb.
RESULTS: An average gain of 1.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was 
estimated for ibrutinib compared with G-Clb at an average additional cost of 
£112,835 per patient. To be cost-effective as per the UK thresholds, ibrutinib 
needs to be discounted at 30%, 40%, and 50% if idelalisib is discounted at 0%, 
25%, and 50% respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £75,648 
and £-143,279 per QALY gained for the base-case and scenario analyses, 
respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the results.
CONCLUSION: As per base-case analyses, an adequate discount on ibrutinib is 
required to make it cost-effective as per the UK thresholds. The scenario 
analysis substantiates ibrutinib's cost-savings for the UK National Health

AIM: To investigate clinical, etiological, and prognostic features in patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma.
METHODS: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were followed-up from 2001 
to 2011 were included in the study. The diagnosis was established by 
histopathological and/or radiological criteria. We retrospectively reviewed 
clinical and laboratory data, etiology of primary liver disease, imaging 
characteristics and treatments. Child-Pugh and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer 
stage was determined at initial diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was 
done to find out treatment effect on survival. Risk factors for vascular 
invasion and overall survival were investigated by multivariate Cox regression 
analyses.
RESULTS: Five hundred and forty-five patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were 
included in the study. Viral hepatitis was prevalent and 68 patients either had 
normal liver or were non-cirrhotic. Overall median survival was 16 (13-19) mo. 
Presence of extrahepatic metastasis was associated with larger tumor size (OR = 
3.19, 95%CI: 1.14-10.6). Independent predictor variables of vascular invasion 
were AFP (OR = 2.95, 95%CI: 1.38-6.31), total tumor diameter (OR = 3.14, 95%CI: 
1.01-9.77), and hepatitis B infection (OR = 5.37, 95%CI: 1.23-23.39). Liver 
functional reserve, tumor size/extension, AFP level and primary treatment 
modality were independent predictors of overall survival. Transarterial 
chemoembolization (HR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.28-0.51) and radioembolization (HR = 
0.36, 95%CI: 0.18-0.74) provided a comparable survival benefit in the real life 
setting. Surgical treatments as resection and transplantation were found to be 
associated with the best survival compared with loco-regional treatments 
(log-rank, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Baseline liver function, oncologic features including AFP level and 
primary treatment modality determines overall survival in patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Eating disorders and obesity adversely affect individuals both medically and 
psychologically, leading to reduced life expectancy and poor quality of life. 
While there exist a number of treatments for anorexia, morbid obesity and 
bulimia, many patients do not respond favorably to current behavioral, medical 
or bariatric surgical management. Neuromodulation has been postulated as a 
potential treatment for eating disorders and obesity. In particular, deep brain 
stimulation and transcranial non-invasive brain stimulation have been studied 
for these indications across a variety of brain targets. Here, we review the 
neurobiology behind eating and eating disorders as well as the current status of 
preclinical and clinical neuromodulation trials for eating disorders and 
obesity.

Endoprosthetic replacement (EPR) and intramedullary nailing (IMN) are the two 
most commonly applied surgical methods used to treat proximal metastatic 
lesions; however, indication of the above procedures remains controversial. The 
aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical, functional and 
oncological outcomes of patients who underwent EPR compared to IMN for the 
treatment of proximal femur metastases to investigate the surgical indication 
for patients. The records of patients (n=88) with pathological fractures 
secondary to metastatic tumors of the proximal femur admitted between January 
2005 and December 2014 to West China Hospital, Sichuan University (Chengdu, 
China) were retrospectively studied. A total of 57 patients were treated with 
EPR (34 males and 23 females; mean age, 62.5 years) and 31 patients were 
stabilized with IMN (19 males and 12 females; mean age, 60.2 years). Patients 
were analyzed regarding surgery time, blood loss, hospital stay, Musculoskeletal 
Tumor Society (MSTS) score, survival, recurrence and complications. The median 
follow-up period was 12.9 (range, 3-98) months. The median survival time in EPR 
was 10.0 months and 7.5 months in IMN. The surgery time was 142.6±22.7 min in 
the EPR group and 98.7±19.5 min in the IMN group (P=0.001). Significantly less 
blood loss was observed in the IMN group (345.2±66.4 ml) than in the EPR group 
(631.5±103.6 ml; P=0.001). The median hospital stay in the EPR group was 8 
(quartile range, 7-9) days and 5 (quartile range, 5-6) days in the IMN group 
(P=0.001). Local recurrence rate was 10.5% (6/57) in the EPR group and 25.8% 
(8/31) in the IMN group (P=0.074). The complication rates were 10.5% (6/57) in 
the EPR group and 29.0% (9/31) in the IMN group (P=0.038). MSTS-93 score was 
higher in IMN compared with EPR at 6 weeks postoperatively (P=0.001), while the 
EPR group demonstrated a higher score at 6 months postoperatively (P=0.001). EPR 
has the advantage of better functional outcomes and higher life quality in the 
long term, with lower complication rates in treating metastatic lesions of the 
proximal femur with pathological fractures. EPR is recommended for patients with 
relatively good general condition and prognosis. IMN is best indicated when the 
patient's life expectancy is extremely limited.

Catheter-directed thrombolysis of deep vein thrombosis: literature review and 
practice considerations.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a major health problem worldwide. The risk of 
pulmonary embolism following DVT is well established, but the long-term vascular 
sequelae of DVT are often underappreciated, costly to manage, and can have 
extremely detrimental effects on quality of life. Treatment of DVT classically 
involves oral anticoagulation, which reduces the risk of pulmonary embolism but 
does not remove the clot. Anticoagulation therefore does little to prevent the 
venous damage and scarring that occurs following DVT, leaving the patient at 
risk for permanent venous insufficiency and development of post-thrombotic 
syndrome (PTS). Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is a minimally invasive 
endovascular treatment that is used as an adjunct to anticoagulation. CDT lowers 
the risk of PTS by reducing clot burden and protecting against valvular damage. 
A catheter is advanced directly to the site of thrombosis under fluoroscopy 
followed by a slow, prolonged infusion of a relatively low dose of thrombolytic 
agent. CDT restores venous patency faster than anticoagulation, which hastens 
the relief of acute symptoms. Adjunctive CDT modalities have become increasingly 
popular among interventional radiologists, allowing for additional mechanical 
thrombectomy or ultrasound-enhanced thrombolysis at the time of catheter 
placement. These pharmacomechanical CDT (PCDT) techniques have the potential to 
reduce treatment time and associated healthcare costs. Numerous observational 
and retrospective studies have consistently shown a benefit of CDT plus 
anticoagulation over anticoagulation alone for prevention of PTS. Patients with 
long life expectancy and acute thrombosis involving the iliac and proximal 
femoral veins (iliofemoral DVT) have the greatest benefit from CDT, which may 
decrease the risk of PTS and/or decrease the severity of PTS symptoms if they do 
occur. Randomized controlled trials remain limited but generally support the 
observational data. CDT also plays an important role in those with acute 
limb-threatening venous occlusion or severe symptoms from DVT. Although adverse 
outcomes are rare, a potential devastating outcome is intracranial bleeding. 
While the available literature suggests the risk of serious morbidity from 
bleeding is quite rare, the absolute risk of bleeding is not clear and will 
require outcomes data from randomized trials. Future studies should also examine 
the cost-effectiveness of CDT for PTS prevention, particularly with respect to 
quality-adjusted life years, and compare the effectiveness of available PCDT 
devices.

Cultural concepts of the person and mental health in Africa.

Kpanake L(1).

People in different cultures have different concepts of the person that underlie 
self-understanding and self-representation. These concepts influence many 
aspects of individuals' life experience, including illness and expectations 
toward recovery. Psychotherapies aim to promote adaptive change in experience 
and behavior. This goal is embedded in a social and cultural context that 
promotes or sanctions a particular notion of personhood. If every system of 
psychotherapy depends on implicit models of personhood, which varies 
cross-culturally, then the goals and methods of therapeutic change must consider 
the cultural concept of the person. This paper reviews cultural concepts of the 
person in relation to communal values, practices, and systems of thought 
observed across many African cultural contexts. It presents a practical 
framework that can inform therapists working with African clients. Many African 
cultures promote a relational-oriented personhood, in which an individual 
manifests his or her personhood through connections to three distinct forms of 
agency: (a) spiritual agency, including God, ancestors, and spirits that 
influence the person; (b) social agency, including the family, the clan, and the 
community, with extension to humanity; and (c) self-agency, which is responsible 
for the person's inner experience. This distinctive form of personhood underlies 
concepts of the "normal" person, understandings of mental illness, help-seeking 
behavior, and clients' needs and expectations. Implications of this cultural 
concept of the person for psychotherapy with African clients are discussed.

With social policies increasingly directed toward enhancing equity through 
health programs, it is important that methods for estimating the health and 
economic benefits of these programs by subpopulation be developed, to assess 
both equity concerns and the programs' total impact. We estimated the 
differential health impact (measured as the number of deaths averted) and 
household economic impact (measured as the number of cases of medical 
impoverishment averted) of ten antigens and their corresponding vaccines across 
income quintiles for forty-one low- and middle-income countries. Our analysis 
indicated that benefits across these vaccines would accrue predominantly in the 
lowest income quintiles. Policy makers should be informed about the large health 
and economic distributional impact that vaccines could have, and they should 
view vaccination policies as potentially important channels for improving health 
equity. Our results provide insight into the distribution of vaccine-preventable 
diseases and the health benefits associated with their prevention.

People with serious mental illness experience decreased life expectancy related 
to co-occurring medical conditions. A nonprofit behavioral health managed care 
organization implemented an innovative behavioral health home, in partnership 
with community mental health providers, to build a culture of wellness among all 
staff members, with a focus on prevention and holistic (that is, behavioral, 
social, and physical) health. The behavioral health home added one of two 
distinct care approaches, one patient driven and the other provider driven. The 
innovative approaches were implemented at eleven community mental health 
providers: Six delivered patient-driven care, and five delivered provider-driven 
care. We studied outcomes in the period October 2013-January 2016. Multiple 
diffusion strategies were utilized to encourage uptake. Our results revealed 
that both approaches significantly increased patient activation in care (more 
quickly in provider-supported care), engagement in primary and specialty care, 
and perceived mental health status. The success of this behavioral health home 
in improving important outcomes and the use of novel diffusion strategies led to 
its dissemination to forty-three additional providers across Pennsylvania.

Purpose To determine the effects of patient age and comorbidity level on life 
expectancy (LE) benefits associated with imaging follow-up of Bosniak IIF renal 
cysts and pancreatic side-branch (SB) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms 
(IPMNs). Materials and Methods A decision-analytic Markov model to evaluate LE 
benefits was developed. Hypothetical cohorts with varied age (60-80 years) and 
comorbidities (none, mild, moderate, or severe) were evaluated. For each 
finding, LE projections from two strategies were compared: imaging follow-up and 
no imaging follow-up. Under follow-up, it was assumed that cancers associated 
with the incidental finding were successfully treated before they spread. For 
patients without follow-up, mortality risks from Bosniak IIF cysts (renal cell 
carcinoma) and SBIPMNs (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) were incorporated. 
Model assumptions and parameter uncertainty were evaluated in sensitivity 
analysis. Results In the youngest, healthiest cohorts (age, 60 years; no 
comorbidities), projected LE benefits from follow-up were as follows: Bosniak 
IIF cyst, 6.5 months (women) and 5.8 months (men); SBIPMN, 6.4 months (women) 
and 5.3 months (men). Follow-up of Bosniak IIF cysts in 60-year-old women with 
severe comorbidities yielded a LE benefit of 3.9 months; in 80-year-old women 
with no comorbidities, the benefit was 2.8 months, and with severe comorbidities 
the benefit was 1.5 months. Similar trends were observed in men and for SBIPMN. 
Results were sensitive to the performance of follow-up for cancer detection; 
malignancy risks; and stage at presentation of malignant, unfollowed Bosniak IIF 
cysts. Conclusion With progression of age and comorbidity level, follow-up of 
low-risk incidental findings yields increasingly limited benefits for patients.

Community capacity development to enhance hospice palliative care in Alberta, 
Canada communities: evidence demonstrating the value of a community engaged 
model.

Our study explored the value of a community engaged model for good hospice care 
in three rural communities in Alberta, Canada. When communities are highly 
engaged in planning and implementing hospice care in their communities, our 
study discovered that they have key characteristics: that volunteerism needs to 
be balanced to prevent burnout; that the local knowledge of community members is 
used in a number of ways to plan and provide good hospice care; that a variety 
of resources, infrastructure, policies and expertise are used by the community 
to nurture community-focused palliative care initiatives. The value to the 
community or social capital, that accrues from these initiatives is not easily 
appreciated by the community members, and community-based initiatives benefit 
when this value is identified for them. In all three communities a focus group 
was conducted separately with the Hospice Society board and with family members 
and volunteers connected with the Hospice Society. Participants attending this 
oral presentation will learn how community palliative care is perceived by 
non-professional community leaders, as well as strategies that may help address 
barriers that are encountered when communities become engaged in addressing 
their own hospice and end of life care needs.

Collaborative model used to develop a resource guide for communities to enhance 
their palliative and end of life care: the case of Alberta, Canada.

Whitfield K(1).

(1)Faculty of Extension, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

In response to the desire of community organizations in Alberta for information 
and guidance as they seek to improve palliative and end of life care in their 
communities, a large number of organizations collaborated to develop a resource 
guide. In order to achieve this goal, it was first necessary to identify the 
common information needs of Alberta communities as they pursue their vision for 
improving local Palliative and End-of-Life Care. A committee comprised of 
representatives from Alberta Health Services, Alberta Health, Alberta Hospice 
Palliative Care Association, Hospice Societies, University researchers, 
Indigenous Health and Palliative Care physicians surveyed numerous community 
groups and stakeholders about their information needs. As a result of their 
feedback several themes were identified which formed the basis of the Resource 
Guide for Community-based Palliative and End-of-Life Care. This oral 
presentation will leave participants with a good understanding of how multiple 
stakeholders can work together to strengthen community-led palliative and
