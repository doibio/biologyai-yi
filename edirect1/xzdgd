appropriate ATT. The primary outcomes were time to institutionalisation and 
cost-effectiveness. Key secondary outcomes were number of incidents involving 
risks to safety, burden and stress in family caregivers and quality of life.
RESULTS: Participants were assigned to receive full ATT (248 participants) or 
the limited control (247 participants). After adjusting for baseline imbalance 
of activities of daily living score, HR for median pre-institutionalisation 
survival was 0.84; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.12; P = 0.20. There were no significant 
differences between arms in health and social care (mean -£909; 95% CI, -£5,336 
to £3,345, P = 0.678) and societal costs (mean -£3,545; 95% CI, -£13,914 to 
£6,581, P = 0.499). ATT group members had reduced participant-rated 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at 104 weeks (mean - 0.105; 95% CI, -0.204 
to -0.007, P = 0.037) but did not differ in QALYs derived from proxy-reported 
EQ-5D.
DISCUSSION: Fidelity of the intervention was low in terms of matching ATT 
assessment, recommendations and installation. This, however, reflects current 
practice within adult social care in England.
CONCLUSIONS: Time living independently outside a care home was not significantly 
longer in participants who received full ATT and ATT was not cost-effective. 
Participants with full ATT attained fewer QALYs based on participant-reported 
EQ-5D than controls at 104 weeks.

BACKGROUND: Deferral of surgeries due to COVID-19 has negatively affected access 
to elective surgery and may have deleterious consequences for patient's health. 
Delays in access to elective surgery are not uniform in their impact on patients 
with different attributes. The objective of this study is to measure the change 
in patient's cost utility due to delayed elective cholecystectomy.
METHODS: This study is based on retrospective analysis of a longitudinal sample 
of participants who have had elective cholecystectomy and completed the 
EQ-5D(3L) measuring health status preoperatively and postoperatively. Emergent 
cases were excluded. Patients younger than 19 years of age, unable to 
communicate in English or residing in a long-term care facility were ineligible. 
Quality-adjusted life years attributable to cholecystectomy were calculated by 
comparing health state utility values between the pre- and postoperative time 
points. The loss in quality-adjusted life years due to delayed access was 
calculated under four assumed scenarios regarding the length of the delay. The 
mean cost per quality-adjusted life years are shown for the overall sample and 
by sex and age categories.
RESULTS: Among the 646 eligible patients, 30.1% of participants (N = 195) 
completed their preoperative and postoperative EQ-5D(3L). A delay of 12 months 
resulted in a mean loss of 6.4%, or 0.117, of the quality-adjusted life years 
expected without the delay. Among patients older than 70 years of age, a 
12-month delay in their surgery corresponded with a 25.1% increase in the cost 
per quality-adjusted life years, from $10 758 to $13 463.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to focus on minimizing loss of quality of life for 
patients affected by delayed surgeries. Faced with equal delayed access to 
elective surgery, triage may need to prioritize older patients to maximize their 
health over their remaining life years.

CONTEXT: It is crucial that physicians understand differing attitudes toward 
euthanasia and which factors to consider when discussing end-of-life decisions 
with patients and families from diverse backgrounds.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate how attitudes toward euthanasia differ among 
countries, how they change, and how economic, religious, and health-related 
factors affect these attitudes.
METHODS: We analyzed attitudes toward euthanasia and economic, religious, and 
health-related indicators using longitudinal (1981-2018) World Values Survey 
(WVS) data. They included 62 countries with at least a 15-year, three-wave, time 
series (total n = 389,243 participants). Each national survey interviewed 
representative samples of adults (mean = 1405).
RESULTS: In the latest wave, The Netherlands had the most favorable views of 
euthanasia (10-point scale with 1 = least justifiable: mean = 7.47) and Jordan 
the least (mean = 1.50). Residents of 23 of 24 high-income countries came to 
view euthanasia as more justifiable, while residents of 12 of 38 middle- and 
low-income countries came to view it as less justifiable over time. The higher 
GDP per-capita at the time of survey, the more euthanasia was accepted 
(r = 0.703; P< 0.0001); the more important respondents viewed religion as being, 
the less euthanasia was accepted (r = -0.834; P< 0.0001); the higher life 
expectancy and the lower infant mortality were, the more euthanasia was accepted 
(r = 0.669; P< 0.0001/r = -0.716; P< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Euthanasia-related attitudes differ widely depending on the cultural 
context; changes over time varied in both directions; euthanasia-related 
attitudes were associated with economic, religious and health-related factors. 
With globalization increasing cultural diversity, these findings can inform 
physicians' communication about end-of-life decisions with patients and families 
from diverse backgrounds.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Adult spinal deformity patients treated operatively by 
long-segment instrumented spinal fusion are prone to develop proximal junctional 
kyphosis (PJK) and failure (PJF). A gradual transition in range of motion (ROM) 
at the proximal end of spinal instrumentation may reduce the incidence of PJK 
and PJF, however, previously evaluated techniques have not directly been 
compared.
PURPOSE: To determine the biomechanical characteristics of five different 
posterior spinal instrumentation techniques to achieve semirigid junctional 
fixation, or "topping-off," between the rigid pedicle screw fixation (PSF) and 
the proximal uninstrumented spine.
STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical cadaveric study.
METHODS: Seven fresh-frozen human cadaveric spine segments (T8-L3) were 
subjected to ex vivo pure moment loading in flexion-extension, lateral bending 
and axial rotation up to 5 Nm. The native condition, three-level PSF (T11-L2), 
PSF with supplemental transverse process hooks at T10 (TPH), and two sublaminar 
taping techniques (knotted and clamped) as one- (T10) or two-level (T9, T10) 
semirigid junctional fixation techniques were compared. The ROM and neutral zone 
(NZ) of the segments were normalized to the native condition. The linearity of 
the transition zones over three or four segments was determined through linear 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: All techniques achieved a significantly reduced ROM at T10-T11 in 
flexion-extension and axial rotation relative to the PSF condition. 
Additionally, both two-level sublaminar taping techniques (CT2, KT2) had a 
significantly reduced ROM at T9-T10. One-level clamped sublaminar tape (CT1) had 
a significantly lower ROM and NZ compared with one-level knotted sublaminar tape 
(KT1) at T10-T11. Linear regression analysis showed the highest linear 
correlation between ROM and vertebral level for TPH and the lowest linear 
correlation for CT2.
CONCLUSIONS: All studied semirigid junctional fixation techniques significantly 
reduced the ROM at the junctional levels and thus provide a more gradual 
transition than pedicle screws. TPH achieves the most linear transition over 
three vertebrae, whereas KT2 achieves that over four vertebrae. In contrast, CT2 
effectively is a one-level semirigid junctional fixation technique with a shift 
in the upper rigid fixation level. Clamped sublaminar tape reduces the NZ 
greatly, whereas knotted sublaminar tape and TPH maintain a more physiologic NZ. 
Clinical validation is ultimately required to translate the biomechanics of 
various semirigid junctional fixation techniques into the clinical goal of 
reducing the incidence of proximal junctional kyphosis and failure.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The direct biomechanical comparison of multiple 
instrumentation techniques that aim to reduce the incidence of PJK after 
thoracolumbar spinal fusion surgery provides a basis upon which clinical studies 
could be designed. Furthermore, the data provided in this study can be used to 
further analyze the biomechanical effects of the studied techniques using finite 
element models to better predict their post-operative effectiveness.

RATIONALE: Globally, the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) disease is 
significantly higher among men compared to women. This is compounded by men's 
poorer uptake of TB testing and treatment, and worse outcomes for smear 
conversion and successful treatment completion compared to women; in South 
Africa specifically, TB accounts for a large portion of sex-specific life 
expectancy differences.
OBJECTIVE: To understand men's unique barriers to accessing care and their needs 
while engaged in TB treatment, we conducted a qualitative study with men 
currently in or who recently completed TB treatment to understand how social 
norms for masculinity influence resource access and health behaviors, and in 
turn affect their engagement in care.
METHODS: We interviewed 31 men using a semi-structured protocol, with domains 
including: social network composition and support; TB illness; and testing, 
treatment, and clinical care experiences. Interviews were analyzed using a 
constant comparison approach to identify resources and how these are exchanged 
within men's social networks for TB care.
RESULTS: We found that men's prioritizing of work ensured food security and 
maintenance of masculinity norms, but delayed seeking and engagement in care. 
Once in treatment, men found it difficult both to negotiate clinic hours and 
work schedules and to navigate clinic environments without being labeled as 
weak. To mitigate individual resource gaps and losses, men typically accessed 
women family members who provided key resources (e.g., food, money, and 
emotional encouragement). Masculine identification with fatherhood was a key 
motivator to remain engaged in TB care and treatment. Loss from care was 
facilitated by isolation and limited access to social network resources.
CONCLUSION: To improve men's engagement in care and successful treatment 
outcomes, interventions that leverage their social networks and build upon 
existing resources should be strongly considered.

BACKGROUND:  The lockdown measures imposed in Germany starting in mid-March had 
a significant impact on public life. While the avoidance of social contacts was 
possible in many areas, the responsibility to provide themselves with food was 
placed in the hands of private households.
OBJECTIVES:  To investigate whether and to what extent the restrictions led to 
changes regarding visits to supermarkets using cars.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Data were available on the parking movements on 136 
parking spaces of supermarkets in Germany between the beginning of February and 
the end of May. The analyses focused on changes in the total number of parking 
events per day and slot as well as their duration.
RESULTS:  Regarding the parking events, there was a clear reduction until the 
end of April, interrupted by an increase around Easter. After the introduction 
of mandatory masking, the values recovered to just below the level before 
lockdown. The duration changed relatively slightly. Initially it decreased, but 
later rose slightly above the level observed before the restrictions. Over the 
medium term, there was a slight reduction of parking events and an extension of 
their duration by a little more than 5%. Discussion Despite the explicit 
exclusion of food purchases from the lockdown measures, a dynamic adaptation 
behaviour of the population to the changing circumstances is also evident in 
this context. In terms of parking movements, a lasting effect on shopping 
behaviour seems unlikely.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND:  Die in Deutschland ab Mitte März verhängten 
Ausgangsbeschränkungen hinterließen in vielen Bereichen des öffentlichen Lebens 
deutliche Spuren. Während das Vermeiden sozialer Kontakte in vielen Bereichen 
durchaus möglich war, blieb die Versorgung mit Lebensmitteln der Verantwortung 
der privaten Haushalte überlassen.
ZIEL DER ARBEIT:  Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht, ob und inwiefern die 
Beschränkungen zu Veränderungen hinsichtlich der Besuche von Supermärkten mit 
Personenkraftwagen geführt haben.
MATERIAL UND METHODEN:  Zur Verfügung stehen Daten über die Parkbewegungen von 
136 Parkplätzen von Supermärkten in Deutschland zwischen Anfang Februar und Ende 
Mai. Im Fokus der Analysen stehen Veränderungen der Gesamtzahl an Parkvorgängen 
pro Tag und Stellplatz sowie deren Dauer.
ERGEBNISSE:  Mit Blick auf die Parkvorgänge zeigt sich eine deutliche Reduktion 
bis Ende April, unterbrochen durch einen temporären Anstieg um die 
Osterfeiertage. Nach Einführung der Maskenpflicht erholen sich die Werte wieder 
bis knapp unter das Vorniveau. Die Parkdauer verändert sich nur vergleichsweise 
wenig. Sie sinkt mit den Beschränkungen, steigt jedoch später leicht über das 
Niveau vor den Beschränkungen. Mittelfristig ist eine leichte Reduzierung der 
Parkvorgänge und eine Verlängerung ihrer Dauer um jeweils gut 5% zu beobachten.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG:  Trotz ausdrücklicher Ausnahme der Einkäufe von Lebensmitteln 
von den Ausgangsbeschränkungen zeigt sich auch in diesem Bereich ein dynamisches 
Anpassungsverhalten der Bevölkerung an die sich verändernden Gegebenheiten. Ein 
dauerhafter Effekt auf die Einkaufsgewohnheiten scheint gemessen an den 
Parkbewegungen unwahrscheinlich.

Background and objectives: Global sagittal imbalance with lumbar hypo-lordosis 
can cause low back pain (LBP) during standing and/or walking. This condition has 
recently been well-known as one of the major causes of reduced health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL) in elderly populations. Decrease in disc space of 
anterior elements and an increase in the spinous process height of posterior 
elements may both contribute to the decrease in lordosis of the lumbar spine. To 
correct the sagittal imbalance, the mainstream option is still a highly invasive 
surgery, such as long-segment fusion with posterior wedge osteotomy. Therefore, 
we developed a treatment that is partial resection of several spinous processes 
of thoraco-lumbar spine (PRSP) and lumbar extension exercise to improve the 
flexibility of the spine as postoperative rehabilitation. Materials and Methods: 
Consecutively, seven patients with over 60 mm of sagittal vertical axis (SVA) 
underwent PRSP. The operation was performed with several small midline skin 
incisions under general anesthesia. After splitting the supraspinous ligaments, 
the cranial or caudal tip of the spinous process of several thoraco-lumbar 
spines was removed, and postoperative rehabilitation was followed to improve 
extension flexibility. Results: The average follow-up period was 13.0 months. 
The average blood loss and operation time were 11.4 mL and 47.4 min, 
respectively. The mean SVA improved from 119 to 93 mm but deteriorated in one 
case. The mean numerical rating scale of low back pain improved from 6.6 to 3.7 
without any exacerbations. The mean Oswestry Disability Index score was improved 
from 32.4% to 19.1% in six cases, with one worsened case. Conclusions: We 
performed PRSP and lumbar extension exercise for the patients with LBP due to 
lumbar kyphosis. This minimally invasive treatment was considered to be 
effective in improving the symptoms of low back pain and HRQOL, especially of 
elderly patients with lumbar kyphosis.

Bats carry many viruses, but this is not sufficient to threaten humans. Viruses 
must mutate to generate the ability to transfer to humans. A key factor is the 
diversity of species. With 1400 species of bats (20% of all species of mammals), 
the diversity of bats species is highly favorable to the emergence of new 
viruses. Moreover, several species of bats live within the same location, and 
share advanced social behavior, favoring the transmission of viruses. Because 
they fly, bats are also hosts for a wide range of viruses from many 
environments. They also eat everything (including what humans eat), they share 
humans' environment and become closer to domestic species, which can serve as 
relays between bats and humans. Bats also have a long-life expectancy (up to 40 
years for some bats), which is particularly effective for transmission to 
humans. However, a recent publication came out challenging what we think about 
bats. Proportionally, bats may not carry a higher number of zoonotic pathogens, 
normalized by species richness, compared to other mammalian and avian species. 
Viral zoonotic risk is homogenous among taxonomic orders of mammalian and avian 
reservoir hosts, without evidence that bats carry more viruses that infect 
humans.

In recent years, the management of health systems is a main concern of 
governments and decision-makers. Home health care is one of the newest methods 
of providing services to patients in developed societies that can respond to the 
individual lifestyle of the modern age and the increase of life expectancy. The 
home health care routing and scheduling problem is a generalized version of the 
vehicle routing problem, which is extended to a complex problem by adding 
special features and constraints of health care problems. In this problem, there 
are multiple stakeholders, such as nurses, for which an increase in their 
satisfaction level is very important. In this study, a mathematical model is 
developed to expand traditional home health care routing and scheduling models 
to downgrading cost aspects by adding the objective of minimizing the difference 
between the actual and potential skills of the nurses. Downgrading can lead to 
nurse dissatisfaction. In addition, skillful nurses have higher salaries, and 
high-level services increase equipment costs and need more expensive training 
and nursing certificates. Therefore, downgrading can enforce huge hidden costs 
to the managers of a company. To solve the bi-objective model, an 
ε-constraint-based approach is suggested, and the model applicability and its 
ability to solve the problem in various sizes are discussed. A sensitivity 
analysis on the Epsilon parameter is conducted to analyze the effect of this 
parameter on the problem. Finally, some managerial insights are presented to 
help the managers in this field, and some directions for future studies are 
mentioned as well.

OBJECTIVE: Many studies have reported positive surgical outcomes and decreased 
mortality after spine surgery in the elderly population, including patients 
between 85 and 90 years of age. Here, in addition to patient age, we 
investigated the influence of frailty on short and long-term mortality in 
octogenarians after lumbar surgery.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 162 patients over 80 years of 
age who underwent posterior lumbar fusion or decompressive laminectomy between 
January 2011 and September 2016. We examined patient survival and modified 
frailty index (mFI) from medical records.
RESULTS: By October 2019, 29 of 162 patients had expired (follow-up period: 
1-105 months). Three-month mortality was 1.9%, and 1-year mortality was 4.9%. 
Frailty did not affect long-term survival at 1 year but was associated with 
3-month mortality (p = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: There was no relationship in long-term survival according to frailty 
in patients 80 years of age or older, but a difference was identified in 
short-term mortality. When making a surgical decision for lumbar spine surgery 
in frail patients over 80 years of age, surgeons should pay attention to the 
short-term prognosis.

Global population growth, increased life expectancy and climate change are all 
impacting world's food systems. In industrialised countries, many individuals 
are consuming significantly more protein than needed to maintain health, with 
the majority being obtained from animal products, including meat, dairy, fish 
and other aquatic animals. Current animal production systems are responsible for 
a large proportion of land and fresh-water use, and directly contributing to 
climate change through the production of greenhouse gases. Overall, 
approximately 60% of the global protein produced is used for animal and fish 
feed. Concerns about their impact on both human, and planetary health, have led 
to calls to dramatically curb our consumption of animal products. Underutilised 
plants, insects and single-cell organisms are all actively being considered as 
alternative protein sources. Each present challenges that need to be met before 
they can become economically viable and safe alternatives for food or feed. Many 
plant species contain anti-nutritional factors that impair the digestion and 
absorption of protein and micronutrients. Insects represent a potentially rich 
source of high-quality protein although, questions remain relating to 
digestibility, allergenicity and biosecurity. Algae, fungi and bacteria are also 
a rich source of protein and there is growing interest in the development of 
'cultured meat' using stem cell technology. For the foreseeable future, it 
appears likely that the 'protein-economy' will remain mixed. The present paper 
reviews progress and future opportunities in the development of novel protein 
sources as food and animal feed.

A dietary sterol trade-off determines lifespan responses to dietary restriction 
in Drosophila melanogaster females.

Diet plays a significant role in maintaining lifelong health. In particular, 
lowering the dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio can improve lifespan. This has 
been interpreted as a direct effect of these macronutrients on physiology. Using 
Drosophila melanogaster, we show that the role of protein and carbohydrate on 
lifespan is indirect, acting by altering the partitioning of limiting amounts of 
dietary sterols between reproduction and lifespan. Shorter lifespans in flies 
fed on high protein: carbohydrate diets can be rescued by supplementing their 
food with cholesterol. Not only does this fundamentally alter the way we 
interpret the mechanisms of lifespan extension by dietary restriction, these 
data highlight the important principle that life histories can be affected by 
nutrient-dependent trade-offs that are indirect and independent of the nutrients 
(often macronutrients) that are the focus of study. This brings us closer to 
understanding the mechanistic basis of dietary restriction.

Plain Language Summary: For the past fifteen years, animal studies have 
consistently shown that a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (‘carbs’) diet can 
extend the lifespan of many organisms, but at the cost of the number of 
offspring an individual can produce. Yet, it is still unclear what the best 
dietary balance is, and how these effects arise. One potential explanation could 
be that reproduction damages the body: low levels of proteins would therefore 
prolong life by lowering the reproductive output. Here, Zanco et al. examined 
the possibility that protein intake in fruit flies could instead be acting 
indirectly by changing the levels of a fat-like molecule called cholesterol, 
which is used to maintain the body and to support reproduction. To test this 
idea, groups of fruit flies were fed high levels of proteins. This led to 
increased reproduction rates, in turn depleting the mothers’ reserves of 
cholesterol. Without enough of the molecule in their diet, the insects were less 
able to maintain their bodies, which reduced their lifespan. When Zanco et al. 
added cholesterol to a high-protein diet, the flies lived for the normal length 
of time. Longer lifespan therefore did not require restriction of the diet or 
any of its components. In fact, the flies that lived the longest ate protein 
rich diets, and reproduced the most. This study helps to better understand why 
changes in diet can influence how long an organism lives for, highlighting that 
the abundance of certain key molecules may be more important than restricting 
the levels of proteins, carbs or calories actually consumed.

The concept of a so-called urban advantage in health ignores the possibility of 
heterogeneity in health outcomes across cities. Using a harmonized dataset from 
the SALURBAL project, we describe variability and predictors of life expectancy 
and proportionate mortality in 363 cities across nine Latin American countries. 
Life expectancy differed substantially across cities within the same country. 
Cause-specific mortality also varied across cities, with some causes of death 
(unintentional and violent injuries and deaths) showing large variation within 
countries, whereas other causes of death (communicable, maternal, neonatal and 
nutritional, cancer, cardiovascular disease and other noncommunicable diseases) 
varied substantially between countries. In multivariable mixed models, higher 
levels of education, water access and sanitation and less overcrowding were 
associated with longer life expectancy, a relatively lower proportion of 
communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional deaths and a higher proportion 
of deaths from cancer, cardiovascular disease and other noncommunicable 
diseases. These results highlight considerable heterogeneity in life expectancy 
and causes of death across cities of Latin America, revealing modifiable factors 
that could be amenable to urban policies aimed toward improving urban health in 
Latin America and more generally in other urban environments.

OBJECTIVES: Since its inception, skeletally based paleodemographic research has 
emphasized the utility of biocultural models for interpreting the dynamic 
relationship between the sociocultural and ecological forces accompanying 
demographic transitions and shaping populations' health and well-being. While 
the demographic transition associated with the Neolithic Revolution has been a 
common focus in bioarcheology, the present study analyzes human skeletal remains 
from a large 19th century cemetery in central Indiana to examine population 
dynamics during the second demographic transition, a period generally 
characterized by decreasing fertility rates and improvements in life expectancy. 
This study demonstrates the potential to methodologically identify regional 
variations in the timing and interactions between broad-scale socioeconomic 
changes and technological advancements that characterized the time period 
through observed changes in survivorship and fertility based on age-at-death 
distributions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study uses three temporally distinct samples (AD 
1827-1869; 1870-1889; 1890-1935) from the Bethel Cemetery (n = 503). 
Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with a log- rank tests are utilized to evaluate 
survivorship and mortality over time. Next, Cox proportional hazard analyses are 
employed to examine the interaction between sex and time as covariates. Finally, 
the D0-14/D ratio is applied to estimate fertility for each of the three 
temporally bounded cohorts.
RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazard modeling 
revealed statistically significant differences in survivorship between the three 
time periods. Age-specific mortality rates are reduced among adult female and 
male age classes in this rural community over the course of the 19th and early 
20th centuries, resulting in the increasing life expectancies associated with 
the second demographic transition. While mortality in early adulthood was common 
during the first time period and decreases thereafter, sex was not identified as 
a meaningful covariate. The proportion of juveniles in the three temporal 
samples indicate that fertility rates were higher than national averages for the 
better part of the 19th century and subsequently declined around the turn of 
20th century for this community.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate temporal differences between the three 
periods, demonstrating increased survivorship and decreased mortality and 
fertility over time. These findings corroborate two key features of the second 
demographic transition characterized by the move from high rates of both 
fertility and mortality to reduced rates and a general easing of demographic 
pressures. The observed trends likely reflect improvements in health, coinciding 
the industrial advance and economic development within and around Indianapolis. 
While the socioeconomic factors characterizing the Industrial Revolution drove 
demographic shifts that parallel an equally important epidemiological 
transition, potential regional differences are discussed to highlight 
variability in the timing of demographic transitions. The paleodemographic 
methods utilized in this study demonstrate improved accuracy and efficacy, which 
ultimately advances researchers' potential to disentangle population-specific 
socioeconomic factors that may contribute to asymmetrical experiences of health 
and mortality.

Compared to younger patients, an acceptable state of health in older patients 
with various comorbidities is rarely achieved by the initiation of dialysis. 
Despite dialysis treatment, further functional and cognitive impairments often 
rapidly occur in geriatric patients. Thus, newer studies are concerned with the 
quality of life of this patient group after initiation of dialysis as well as 
with palliative treatment strategies as alternatives. A structured clarification 
for the patients on all possibilities with mediation of all necessary 
information is a prerequisite for a shared decision-making. To assess life 
expectancy after dialysis initiation, various scores have been developed but the 
sensitivity could not fulfil the expectations. In the case of renal replacement, 
chronic intermittent hemodialysis is the treatment form most frequently 
performed in geriatric patients. The main concern of conservative palliative 
treatment is the quality of life and the management of uremic symptoms, which 
have to be addressed by a multidisciplinary team.

Publisher: Verglichen mit jüngeren Patienten kann durch die Einleitung einer 
Dialyse bei älteren und multimorbiden Menschen ein akzeptabler 
Gesundheitszustand sehr viel seltener wiederhergestellt werden. Trotz 
Dialysetherapie kommt es im Verlauf bei geriatrischen Patienten oft rasch sowohl 
zu weiteren funktionellen als auch zu kognitiven Einschränkungen. Neuere Studien 
beschäftigen sich deswegen mit der Lebensqualität dieser Patientengruppe nach 
Einleitung einer Dialysetherapie, aber auch mit konservativ-palliativen 
Therapiestrategien als Alternative. Eine strukturierte Aufklärung der Patienten 
über alle Möglichkeiten mit Vermittlung aller notwendigen Informationen ist 
Voraussetzung für eine gemeinsame Entscheidung. Für die Prognoseabschätzung sind 
verschiedene Scores entwickelt worden, deren Sensitivitäten jedoch die 
Erwartungen nicht erfüllen konnten. Wenn ein Nierenersatz eingeleitet wird, ist 
die chronisch-intermittierende Hämodialyse das am häufigsten eingesetzte 
Verfahren bei geriatrischen Patienten. Im Vordergrund der 
konservativ-palliativen Behandlung stehen die Lebensqualität und die Kontrolle 
der urämischen Symptome mithilfe eines multidisziplinären Teams.

The life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has greatly increased over 
the past decade, and researchers and clinicians must now navigate complex 
disease manifestations that were not a concern prior to the development of 
modern therapies. Explosive growth in the number of CF animal models has also 
occurred over this time span, clarifying CF disease pathophysiology and creating 
opportunities to understand more complex disease processes associated with an 
aging CF population. This review focuses on the CF-associated pathologies of the 
gastrointestinal system and how animal models have increased our understanding 
of this complex multisystemic disease. Although CF is primarily recognized as a 
pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal pathology occurs very commonly and can 
affect the quality of life for these patients. Furthermore, we discuss how 
next-generation genetic engineering of larger animal models will impact the 
field's understanding of CF disease pathophysiology and the development of novel 
therapeutic strategies.

PURPOSE: In light of continued innovation in cancer immunotherapy regimens and 
surgical management, no studies currently exist assessing the effect of these 
advances on global disparities in lip and oral cavity cancer disease burden. The 
purpose of this study is to characterize longitudinal trends in disease burden 
caused by lip and oral cavity cancers globally.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study extracted 
data on lip and oral cavity cancer disease burden from The Global Health Data 
Exchange for 1990-2017. The primary predictor variable was country human 
development index (HDI). The primary outcome variable was disease burden, 
measured by age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100,000 
population, listed for each individual country. Additional variables assessed 
include country-level data on alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking. 
Concentration indices were also calculated. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis 
one-way analysis of variance tests with Bonferroni correction were utilized with 
a significance threshold of 0.008.
RESULTS: A total of 185 countries met inclusion criteria. Global 
age-standardized DALYs increased from 44.5 ± 35.7 to 51.1 ± 41.1 from 1990 to 
2017. High HDI and medium HDI countries showed a +37.6% and +22.4% median 
increase in DALYs, respectively, which is significantly greater than very-high 
HDI (+3.8%) and low HDI countries (-0.5%) (P < .001). The concentration index 
for lip and oral cavity cancer became increasingly negative from -0.064 to 
-0.077 from 1990 to 2015. In 2017, disease burden was concentrated in South Asia 
and Eastern Europe.
CONCLUSIONS: High and medium HDI countries experienced a disproportionate growth 
in lip and oral cavity cancer disease burden. These findings may have resulted 
from increased life expectancy among these countries. Global and public health 
policy initiatives should focus on understanding the mechanisms driving these 
disparities with the goal of reducing disease burden globally.

Cancers that grow in the bone marrow are for most patients scary, painful, and 
incurable. These cancers are especially hard to treat due to the supportive 
microenvironment provided by the bone marrow niche in which they reside. New 
therapies designed to target tumor cells have extended the life expectancy for 
these patients, but better therapies are needed and new ideas for how to target 
these cancers are crucial. This need has led researchers to interrogate whether 
bone marrow adipocytes (BMAds), which increase in number and size during aging 
and in obesity, contribute to cancer initiation or progression within the bone 
marrow. Across the globe, the consensus in the field is a unified "yes". 
However, how to target these adipocytes or the factors they produce and how 
BMAds interact with different tumor cells are open research questions. Herein,
