BACKGROUND: Grass allergen immunotherapy (AIT) reduces symptom severity in 
seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) but its impact on general 
health-related utility has not been characterised for the purposes of economic 
evaluation. The aim of this study was to model the preferred measure of utility, 
EQ-5D index, from symptom severity and estimate incremental quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs) associated with SQ-standardised grass immunotherapy tablet 
(GRAZAX®, 75,000 SQ-T/2,800 BAU, ALK, Denmark).
METHODS: Data were analysed from five consecutive pollen seasons in a randomised 
placebo controlled trial of GRAZAX®. Binomial and Gaussian mixed effects 
modelling related weekly EQ-5D index score to daily symptom and medication 
scores (DSS & DMS respectively). In turn, daily EQ-5D index was estimated from 
ARC symptoms and medication use.
RESULTS: DSS and DMS were the principal predictors of 'perfect' health 
(EQ-5D = 1.000; binomial) and 'imperfect' health (EQ-5D < 1.000; Gaussian). Each 
unit increase in DSS and DMS reduced the odds of 'perfect' health 
(EQ-5D = 1.000) by 27% and 16% respectively, and reduced 'imperfect' health by 
0.17 and 0.13, respectively. Gender remained the only other significant main 
fixed effect (Male odds ratio [OR] = 1.82). Incremental estimated EQ-5D index 
utility for GRAZAX® was observed from day -30 to day +70 of the pooled pollen 
season; mean daily utility for GRAZAX® = 0.938 units (95%CI 0.932-0.943) vs. 
0.914 (0.907-0.921) for placebo, an incremental difference of 0.0238 
(p < 0.001). This translates into an incremental 0.0324 Quality Adjusted Life 
Years over the five year study period.
CONCLUSIONS: ARC symptoms and medication use are the main predictors of EQ-5D 
index. The incremental QALYs observed for GRAZAX® may not fully describe the 
health benefits of this treatment, suggesting that economic modelling may be 
conservative.

BACKGROUND: Delayed diagnosis and treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 
has a major adverse impact on prognosis in terms of both morbidity and 
mortality. Since conventional cardiac Troponin assays have a low sensitivity for 
diagnosing AMI in the first hours after myocardial necrosis, high-sensitive 
assays have been developed. The aim of this study was to assess the cost 
effectiveness of a high-sensitive Troponin T assay (hsTnT), alone or combined 
with the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) assay in comparison with 
the conventional cardiac Troponin (cTnT) assay for the diagnosis of AMI in 
patients presenting to the hospital with chest pain.
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis (quality adjusted life 
years-QALYs) and a cost effectiveness analysis (life years gained-LYGs) based on 
a decision analytic model, using a health care perspective in the Dutch context 
and a life time time-horizon. The robustness of model predictions was explored 
using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: For a life time incremental cost of 30.70 Euros, use of hsTnT over 
conventional cTnT results in gain of 0.006 Life Years and 0.004 QALY. It should 
be noted here that hsTnT is a diagnostic intervention which costs only 4.39 
Euros/test more than the cTnT test. The ICER generated with the use of hsTnT 
based diagnostic strategy comparing with the use of a cTnT-based strategy, is 
4945 Euros per LYG and 7370 Euros per QALY. The hsTnT strategy has the highest 
probability of being cost effective at thresholds between 8000 and 20000 Euros 
per QALY. The combination of hsTnT and h-FABP strategy's probability of being 
cost effective remains lower than hsTnT at all willingness to pay thresholds.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that hsTnT assay is a very cost effective 
diagnostic tool relative to conventional TnT assay. Combination of hsTnT and 
H-FABP does not offer any additional economic and health benefit over hsTnT test 
alone.

BACKGROUND: The surgical insertion of Ventilation Tubes (VTs) for the management 
of persistent bilateral Otitis Media with Effusion (OME) in children remains a 
contentious issue due to the varying opinions regarding the risks and benefits 
of this procedure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic impact of 
VTs insertion for the management of persistent bilateral OME in children, 
providing an additional perspective on the management of one of the commonest 
medical conditions of childhood.
METHODS: A decision-tree model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of VTs strategy compared with the Hearing Aids (HAs) alone and HAs plus VTs 
strategies. The model used data from published sources, and assumed a 2-year 
time horizon and UK NHS perspective for costs. Outcomes were computed as 
Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) by attaching a utility value to the total 
potential gains in Hearing Level in decibels (dBHL) over 12 and 24 months. 
Modelling uncertainty in the specification of decision-tree probabilities and 
QALYs was performed through Monte Carlo simulation. Expected Value of Perfect 
Information (EVPI) and partial EVPI (EVPPI) analyses were conducted to estimate 
the potential value of future research and uncertainty associated with the key 
parameters.
RESULTS: The VTs strategy was more effective and less costly when compared with 
the HAs plus VTs strategy, while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
the VTs strategy compared with the HAs strategy was £ 5,086 per QALY gained. At 
the willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 20,000 per QALY, the probability that the 
VTs strategy is likely to be more cost-effective was 0.58. The EVPI value at 
population level of around £ 9.5 million at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£ 20,000 indicated that future research in this area is potentially worthwhile, 
while the EVPPI analysis indicated considerable uncertainty surrounding the 
parameters used for computing the QALYs for which more precise estimates would 
be most valuable.
CONCLUSIONS: The VTs strategy is a cost-effective option when compared with the 
HAs alone and HAs plus VTs strategies, but the need for additional information 
from future study is evident to inform this surgical treatment choice. Future 
studies of surgical and non-surgical treatment of OME in childhood should 
evaluate the economic impact of pertinent interventions to provide greater 
context.

BACKGROUND: This study examines the cost effectiveness of group follow-up after 
participation in the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) structured 
education programme for type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: Economic evaluation conducted alongside a cluster randomised controlled 
trial involving 437 adults with type 1 diabetes in Ireland. Group follow-up 
involved two group education 'booster' sessions post-DAFNE. Individual follow-up 
involved two standard one-to-one hospital clinic visits. Incremental costs, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and cost effectiveness were estimated 
at 18 months. Uncertainty was explored using sensitivity analysis and by 
estimating cost effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: Group follow-up was associated with a mean reduction in QALYs gained of 
0.04 per patient (P value, 0.052; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.01, intra-class correlation 
(ICC), 0.033) and a mean reduction in total healthcare costs of €772 (P value, 
0.020; 95% CI, -1,415 to -128: ICC, 0.016) per patient. At alternative threshold 
values of €5,000, €15,000, €25,000, €35,000, and €45,000, the probability of 
group follow-up being cost effective was estimated to be 1.000, 0.762, 0.204, 
0.078, and 0.033 respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support implementation of group follow-up as the 
sole means of follow-up post-DAFNE. Given the reported cost savings, future 
studies should explore the cost effectiveness of alternative models of group 
care for diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this analysis is to report the incremental costs and 
benefits of different doses of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) in patients 
with chronic low back pain (LBP).
METHODS: We randomized 400 patients with chronic LBP to receive a dose of 0, 6, 
12, or 18 sessions of SMT. Participants were scheduled for 18 visits for 6 weeks 
and received SMT or light massage control from a doctor of chiropractic. 
Societal costs in the year after study enrollment were estimated using patient 
reports of health care use and lost productivity. The main health outcomes were 
the number of pain-free days and disability-free days. Multiple regression was 
performed on outcomes and log-transformed cost data.
RESULTS: Lost productivity accounts for most societal costs of chronic LBP. Cost 
of treatment and lost productivity ranged from $3398 for 12 SMT sessions to 
$3815 for 0 SMT sessions with no statistically significant differences between 
groups. Baseline patient characteristics related to increase in costs were 
greater age (P = .03), greater disability (P = .01), lower quality-adjusted life 
year scores (P = .01), and higher costs in the period preceding enrollment (P < 
.01). Pain-free and disability-free days were greater for all SMT doses compared 
with control, but only SMT 12 yielded a statistically significant benefit of 
22.9 pain-free days (P = .03) and 19.8 disability-free days (P = .04). No 
statistically significant group differences in quality-adjusted life years were 
noted.
CONCLUSIONS: A dose of 12 SMT sessions yielded a modest benefit in pain-free and 
disability-free days. Care of chronic LBP with SMT did not increase the costs of 
treatment plus lost productivity.

The nuclear envelope consists of inner and outer nuclear membranes. Whereas the 
outer membrane is an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum, the inner nuclear 
membrane (INM) represents a unique membranous environment containing specific 
proteins. The mechanisms of integral INM protein degradation are unknown. Here, 
we investigated the turnover of Asi2, an integral INM protein in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. We report that Asi2 is degraded by the proteasome independently of 
the vacuole and that it exhibited a half-life of ∼45 min. Asi2 exhibits enhanced 
stability in mutants lacking the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes Ubc6 or Ubc7, 
or the E3 ubiquitin ligase Doa10. Consistent with these data, Asi2 is 
post-translationally modified by poly-ubiquitylation in a Ubc7- and 
Doa10-dependent manner. Importantly Asi2 degradation is significantly reduced in 
a sts1-2 mutant that fails to accumulate proteasomes in the nucleus, indicating 
that Asi2 is degraded in the nucleus. Our results reveal a molecular pathway 
that affects the stability of integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane 
and indicate that Asi2 is subject to protein quality control in the nucleus.

BACKGROUND: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a radiation therapy 
technology that facilitates the delivery of an improved dose distribution with 
less dose to surrounding critical structures. This study estimates the longer 
term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IMRT in patients post radical 
prostatectomy.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was developed to calculate the incremental 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of IMRT compared with three 
dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT). Costs were estimated from the 
perspective of the Australian health care system.
RESULTS: IMRT was both more effective and less costly than 3DCRT over 20 years, 
with an additional 20 QALYs gained and over $1.1 million saved per 1000 patients 
treated. This result was robust to plausible levels of uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: IMRT was estimated to have a modest long term advantage over 3DCRT 
in terms of both improved effectiveness and reduced cost. This result was 
reliant on clinical judgement and interpretation of the existing literature, but 
provides quantitative guidance on the cost effectiveness of IMRT whilst long 
term trial evidence is awaited.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess self-report and perceptual voice outcomes in 
patients undergoing local anaesthetic injection laryngoplasty in our outpatient 
clinic.
DESIGN: Prospective case series.
SETTING: Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Freeman Hospital, 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight patients underwent local anaesthetic injection 
laryngoplasty in the outpatient clinic over the 2-year study period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Voice Performance Questionnaire (patient-rated), and 
perceptual voice analysis (observer-rated) Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, 
Aesthenia and Strain scores were recorded before and 2 weeks after injection 
laryngoplasty.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients had sufficient pre- and post-procedure data to be 
included in the analysis. These included 32 men and 25 women, age range 26-97 
years. Of the remaining patients, they were excluded due to failed procedure (n 
= 3), too unwell to proceed (n = 1), died before follow-up was complete (n = 3) 
and incomplete data (n = 4). The median Voice Performance Questionnaire score 
improved from 42 to 21; (P < 0.0001). Significant improvements were seen in all 
parameters of Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Aesthenia, Strain.
CONCLUSION: Injection laryngoplasty under local anaesthetic in the outpatient 
clinic generates improvements in subjective and perceptual voice outcomes 
similar to those obtained in the operating room under general anaesthetic or 
sedation. Complication rates between these procedures were also comparable. 
Injection laryngoplasty under local anaesthetic is timely, cost-effective and 
obviates need for general anaesthesia in patients, many of whom have 
comorbidities and diminished life expectancy.

Cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in prior pneumonia patients in 
Israel.

Pneumonia is a common complication of influenza infection, and accounts for the 
majority of influenza mortality. Both the WHO and the Ministry of Health in 
Israel prioritize seasonal influenza vaccination primarily on the basis of age 
and specific co-morbidities. Here we consider whether the targeting of 
individuals previously infected with pneumonia for influenza vaccination would 
be a cost-effective addition to the current policy. We performed a retrospective 
cohort data analysis of 163,990 cases of pneumonia hospitalizations and 
1,305,223 cases of outpatient pneumonia from 2004 to 2012, capturing more than 
54% of the Israeli population. Our findings demonstrate that patients infected 
with pneumonia in the year prior had a substantially higher risk of becoming 
infected with pneumonia in subsequent years (relative risk >2.34, p<0.01). 
Results indicated that the benefit of targeting for influenza vaccination 
patients hospitalized with pneumonia in prior year would be cost-saving 
regardless of age. Complementing the current policy with the targeting of prior 
pneumonia patients would require vaccination of only a further 2.3% of the 
Israeli population to save additional 204-407 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) annually at a mean price of 58-1056 USD/QALY saved. Global uncertainty 
analysis demonstrates that the cost-effectiveness of adding this policy is 
robust over a vast range of conditions. As prior pneumonia patients are 
currently not prioritized for influenza vaccination in Israel, nor elsewhere, 
this study suggests a novel supplement of current policies to improve 
cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination. Future studies should use 
case-control study to further evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination in prior 
pneumonia patients.

Estimating the returns to UK publicly funded cancer-related research in terms of 
the net value of improved health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Building on an approach developed to assess the economic returns to 
cardiovascular research, we estimated the economic returns from UK public and 
charitable funded cancer-related research that arise from the net value of the 
improved health outcomes.
METHODS: To assess these economic returns from cancer-related research in the UK 
we estimated: 1) public and charitable expenditure on cancer-related research in 
the UK from 1970 to 2009; 2) net monetary benefit (NMB), that is, the health 
benefit measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) valued in monetary terms 
(using a base-case value of a QALY of GB£25,000) minus the cost of delivering 
that benefit, for a prioritised list of interventions from 1991 to 2010; 3) the 
proportion of NMB attributable to UK research; 4) the elapsed time between 
research funding and health gain; and 5) the internal rate of return (IRR) from 
cancer-related research investments on health benefits. We analysed the 
uncertainties in the IRR estimate using sensitivity analyses to illustrate the 
effect of some key parameters.
RESULTS: In 2011/12 prices, total expenditure on cancer-related research from 
1970 to 2009 was £15 billion. The NMB of the 5.9 million QALYs gained from the 
prioritised interventions from 1991 to 2010 was £124 billion. Calculation of the 
IRR incorporated an estimated elapsed time of 15 years. We related 17% of the 
annual NMB estimated to be attributable to UK research (for each of the 20 years 
1991 to 2010) to 20 years of research investment 15 years earlier (that is, for 
1976 to 1995). This produced a best-estimate IRR of 10%, compared with 9% 
previously estimated for cardiovascular disease research. The sensitivity 
analysis demonstrated the importance of smoking reduction as a major source of 
improved cancer-related health outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a substantive IRR from net health gain to 
public and charitable funding of cancer-related research in the UK, and further 
validated the approach that we originally used in assessing the returns from 
cardiovascular research. In doing so, we have highlighted a number of weaknesses 
and key assumptions that need strengthening in further investigations. 
Nevertheless, these cautious estimates demonstrate that the returns from past 
cancer research have been substantial, and justify the investments made during 
the period 1976 to 1995.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide. In 
Europe alone, at least 8% of the population currently has some degree of CKD. 
CKD is associated with serious comorbidity, reduced life expectancy, and high 
economic costs; hence, the early detection and adequate treatment of kidney 
disease is important. Pre-clinical research can not only give insights into the 
mechanisms of the various kidney diseases but it also allows for investigating 
the outcome of new drugs developed to treat kidney disease. Functional magnetic 
resonance imaging provides non-invasive access to tissue and organ function in 
animal models. Advantages over classical animal research approaches are 
numerous: the same animal might be repeatedly imaged to investigate a progress 
or a treatment of disease over time. This has also a direct impact on animal 
welfare and the refinement of classical animal experiments as the number of 
animals in the studies might be reduced. In this paper, we review current state 
of the art in functional magnetic resonance imaging with a focus on pre-clinical 
kidney imaging.

AIMS: We have previously demonstrated that propyl gallate has a Ca(2+) 
sensitizing effect on the force generation in membrane-permeabilized (skinned) 
cardiac muscle fibers. However, in vivo beneficial effects of propyl gallate as 
a novel Ca(2+) sensitizer remain uncertain. In the present study, we aim to 
explore in vivo effects of propyl gallate.
MAIN METHODS: We compared effects of propyl gallate on ex vivo intact cardiac 
muscle fibers and in vivo hearts in healthy mice with those of pimobendan, a 
clinically used Ca(2+) sensitizer. The therapeutic effect of propyl gallate was 
investigated using a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with reduced 
myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity due to a deletion mutation ΔK210 in cardiac 
troponin T.
KEY FINDINGS: Propyl gallate, as well as pimobendan, showed a positive inotropic 
effect. Propyl gallate slightly increased the blood pressure without changing 
the heart rate in healthy mice, whereas pimobendan decreased the blood pressure 
probably through vasodilation via inhibition of phosphodiesterase and increased 
the heart rate. Propyl gallate prevented cardiac remodeling and systolic 
dysfunction and significantly improved the life-expectancy of knock-in mouse 
model of DCM with reduced myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity due to a mutation in 
cardiac troponin T. On the other hand, gallate, a similarly strong antioxidant 
polyphenol lacking Ca(2+) sensitizing action, had no beneficial effects on the 
DCM mice.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that propyl gallate might be useful for the 
treatment of inherited DCM caused by a reduction in the myofilament Ca(2+) 
sensitivity.

BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving bridging 
procedure in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
Official indications for ECMO are unclear for immunocompromised and HIV-positive 
patients affected by severe hypoxemia. Uncertainties are related to prognosis 
and efficacy of treatment of the underlying disease. However, the care of 
patients with HIV infection has advanced since the introduction of highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with increased life expectancy and decreased 
mortality.
CASE PRESENTATION: Three HIV-infected patients with AIDS were admitted to ICU 
and were treated with ECMO: a 21 years old Caucasian female with congenital HIV 
infection presented with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP); a 38 years old 
Caucasian female with HIV-HCV infection and L. pneumophila pneumonia; a 24 years 
old Caucasian male with fever, cough weight loss and PJP pneumonia. Two patients 
were alive, with a good immunovirological profile and they went back to their 
previous quality of life. The last patient died with septic shock after three 
months of ICU stay.
CONCLUSION: ECMO was effective in three HIV-positive patients with an otherwise 
fatal respiratory failure. All patients had severe immunosuppression and/or 
limited antiretroviral options. A multidisciplinary critical team is needed to 
individualize the use of ECMO in immunocompromised patients, including those 
with HIV infection.

Dandy-walker malformation and down syndrome association: good developmental 
outcome and successful endoscopic treatment of hydrocephalus.

Nigri F(1), Cabral IF(1), da Silva RT(1), Pereira HV(1), Ribeiro CR(1).

Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

The association of Down syndrome (DS) with Dandy Walker malformation (DWM) is 
extremely rare, with only 3 cases reported to date. All cases reported have 
shown a bad life expectancy and a bad developmental outcome. The present case 
reveals the possibility of a good prognosis. A 19-month-old male patient had 
successful endoscopic hydrocephalus treatment and a good developmental outcome. 
He probably had a better outcome because of good DS and DWM prognostic 
parameters. Our patient suffered from a DWM with vermis identification of 2 
fissures and 3 lobes and a DS with a well-preserved tonus, which was not 
associated with other congenital systemic defects. We may conclude that the 
prognosis of DS-DWM association may separately depend on the degree of clinical 
and neurological involvement of each malformation.

Performing colonoscopy in elderly and very elderly patients: Risks, costs and 
benefits.

Lin OS(1).

Seattle, WA 98101, United States.

Many diagnostic and screening colonoscopies are performed on very elderly 
patients. Although colonoscopic yield increases with age, the potential benefits 
in such patients decrease because of shorter life expectancy and more frequent 
comorbidities. Colonoscopy in very elderly patients carries a greater risk of 
complications and morbidity than in younger patients, and is associated with 
lower completion rates and higher likelihood of poor bowel preparation. Thus, 
screening colonoscopy in very elderly patients should be performed only after 
careful consideration of potential benefits, risks and patient preferences. On 
the other hand, diagnostic and therapeutic colonoscopy are more likely to 
benefit even very elderly patients, and in most cases should be performed if 
indicated.

One of the major challenges facing the United States is the high number of 
overweight and obese adults and the growing number of overweight and unfit 
children and youth. To improve the nation's health, young people must move into 
adulthood without the burden of obesity and its associated chronic diseases.
PURPOSE: To address these issues, the American College of Sports Medicine, the 
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and the US Department of 
Agriculture/Agriculture Research Service convened an expert panel meeting in 
October 2012 titled "Energy Balance at a Crossroads: Translating the Science 
into Action." Experts in the fields of nutrition and exercise science came 
together to identify the biological, lifestyle, and environmental changes that 
will most successfully help children and families attain and manage energy 
balance and tip the scale toward healthier weights.
METHODS: Two goals were addressed: 1) professional training and 2) 
consumer/community education. The training goal focused on developing a 
comprehensive strategy to facilitate the integration of nutrition and physical 
activity (PA) using a dynamic energy balance approach for regulating weight into 
the training of undergraduate and graduate students in dietetics/nutrition 
science, exercise science/PA, and pre-K-12 teacher preparation programs and in 
training existing cooperative extension faculty. The education goal focused on 
developing strategies for integrating dynamic energy balance into nutrition and 
PA educational programs for the public, especially programs funded by 
federal/state agencies.
RESULTS: The meeting expert presenters and participants addressed three key 
areas: 1) biological and lifestyle factors that affect energy balance, 2) 
undergraduate/graduate educational and training issues, and 3) best practices 
associated with educating the public about dynamic energy balance.
CONCLUSIONS: Specific consensus recommendations were developed for each goal.

Humans are not cooperative breeders but practice biocultural reproduction.

Bogin B(1), Bragg J, Kuzawa C.

CONTEXT: Alloparental care and feeding of young is often called "cooperative 
breeding" and humans are increasingly described as being a cooperative breeding 
species.
OBJECTIVE: To critically evaluate whether the human offspring care system is 
best grouped with that of other cooperative breeders.
METHODS: (1) Review of the human system of offspring care in the light of 
definitions of cooperative, communal and social breeding; (2) re-analysis of 
human lifetime reproductive effort.
RESULTS: Human reproduction and offspring care are distinct from other species 
because alloparental behaviour is defined culturally rather than by genetic 
kinship alone. This system allows local flexibility in provisioning strategies 
and ensures that care and resources often flow between unrelated individuals. 
This review proposes the term "biocultural reproduction" to describe this unique 
human reproductive system. In a re-analysis of human life history data, it is 
estimated that the intense alloparenting typical of human societies lowers the 
lifetime reproductive effort of individual women by 14-29% compared to 
expectations based upon other mammals.
CONCLUSION: Humans are not cooperative breeders as classically defined; one 
effect of the unique strategy of human biocultural reproduction is a lowering of 
human lifetime reproductive effort, which could help explain lifespan extension.

Unemployment and Suicide Mortality: Evidence from Regional Panel Data in Europe.

Breuer C(1).

Author information:
(1)Ifo Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, Munich, 
Germany.

This paper addresses the influence of economic activity on suicide mortality in 
Europe. To this end, it employs a new panel data set of 275 regions in 29 
countries over the period 1999-2010. The results suggest that unemployment does 
have a significantly positive influence on suicides. In line with economic 
theory, this influence varies among gender and age groups. Men of working age 
are particularly sensitive, while old-age suicide mortality (older than 65 years 
old) hardly responds to unemployment. Moreover, real economic growth negatively 
affects the suicide rates of working-age men. The results withstand several 
robustness checks, such as sample variations, and after controlling for serial 
and spatial autocorrelation.

BACKGROUND: The coexistence of several chronic diseases in one same individual, 
known as multimorbidity, is an important challenge facing health care systems in 
developed countries. Recent studies have revealed the existence of 
multimorbidity patterns clustering systematically associated distinct clinical 
entities. We sought to describe age and gender differences in the prevalence and 
patterns of multimorbidity in men and women over 65 years.
METHODS: Observational retrospective multicentre study based on diagnostic 
information gathered from electronic medical records of 19 primary care centres 
in Aragon and Catalonia. Multimorbidity patterns were identified through 
exploratory factor analysis. We performed a descriptive analysis of previously 
obtained patterns (i.e. cardiometabolic (CM), mechanical (MEC) and 
psychogeriatric (PG)) and the diseases included in the patterns stratifying by 
sex and age group.
RESULTS: 67.5% of the aged population suffered two or more chronic diseases. 
32.2% of men and 45.3% of women were assigned to at least one specific pattern 
of multimorbidity, and 4.6% of men and 8% of women presented more than one 
pattern simultaneously. Among women over 65 years the most frequent pattern was 
the MEC pattern (33.3%), whereas among men it was the CM pattern (21.2%). While 
the prevalence of the CM and MEC patterns decreased with age, the PG pattern 
showed a higher prevalence in the older age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant gender differences were observed in the prevalence of 
multimorbidity patterns, women showing a higher prevalence of the MEC and PG 
patterns, as well as a higher degree of pattern overlapping, probably due to a 
higher life expectancy and/or worse health. Future studies on multimorbidity 
patterns should take into account these differences and, therefore, the study of 
multimorbidity and its impact should be stratified by age and sex.

Advancing the application of systems thinking in health: why cure crowds out 
prevention.

INTRODUCTION: This paper presents a system dynamics computer simulation model to 
illustrate unintended consequences of apparently rational allocations to 
curative and preventive services.
METHODS: A modeled population is subject to only two diseases. Disease A is a 
curable disease that can be shortened by curative care. Disease B is an 
instantly fatal but preventable disease. Curative care workers are financed by 
public spending and private fees to cure disease A. Non-personal, preventive 
services are delivered by public health workers supported solely by public 
spending to prevent disease B. Each type of worker tries to tilt the balance of 
government spending towards their interests. Their influence on the government 
is proportional to their accumulated revenue.
RESULTS: The model demonstrates effects on lost disability-adjusted life years 
and costs over the course of several epidemics of each disease. Policy 
interventions are tested including: i) an outside donor rationally donates extra 
money to each type of disease precisely in proportion to the size of epidemics 
of each disease; ii) lobbying is eliminated; iii) fees for personal health 
services are eliminated; iv) the government continually rebalances the funding 
for prevention by ring-fencing it to protect it from lobbying.The model exhibits 
a "spend more get less" equilibrium in which higher revenue by the curative 
sector is used to influence government allocations away from prevention towards 
cure. Spending more on curing disease A leads paradoxically to a higher overall 
disease burden of unprevented cases of disease B. This paradoxical behavior of 
the model can be stopped by eliminating lobbying, eliminating fees for curative 
services, and ring-fencing public health funding.
CONCLUSIONS: We have created an artificial system as a laboratory to gain 
insights about the trade-offs between curative and preventive health 
allocations, and the effect of indicative policy interventions. The underlying 
dynamics of this artificial system resemble features of modern health systems 
where a self-perpetuating industry has grown up around disease-specific curative 
programs like HIV/AIDS or malaria. The model shows how the growth of curative 
care services can crowd both fiscal and policy space for the practice of 
population level prevention work, requiring dramatic interventions to overcome 
these trends.

PURPOSE: To calculate the probability of one person's life-time death caused by 
a malignant tumor and provide theoretical basis for cancer prevention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The probability of one person's death caused by a tumor 
was calculated by a probability additive formula and based on an abridged life 
table. All data for age-specific mortality were from the third retrospective 
investigation of death cause in China.
RESULTS: The probability of one person's death caused by malignant tumor was 
18.7% calculated by the probability additive formula. On the same way, the 
life-time death probability caused by lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, 
esophageal cancer, colorectal and anal cancer were 4.47%, 3.62%, 3.25%, 2.25%, 
1.11%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Malignant tumor is still the main cause of death in one's life time 
and the most common causes of cancer death were lung, gastric, liver, 
esophageal, colorectal and anal cancers. Targeted forms of cancer prevention and 
treatment strategies should be worked out to improve people's health and prolong 
life in China. The probability additive formula is a more scientific and 
objective method to calculate the probability of one person's life-time death 
than cumulative death probability .

INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoking causes many chronic diseases that are costly and 
result in frequent hospitalisation. Hospital-initiated smoking cessation 
interventions increase the likelihood that patients will become smoke-free. We 
modelled the cost-effectiveness of the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation 
(OMSC), an intervention that includes in-hospital counselling, pharmacotherapy 
and posthospital follow-up, compared to usual care among smokers hospitalised 
with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (UA), heart failure 
(HF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: We completed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a decision-analytic 
model to assess smokers hospitalised in Ontario, Canada for AMI, UA, HF, and 
COPD, their risk of continuing to smoke and the effects of quitting on 
re-hospitalisation and mortality over a 1-year period. We calculated short-term 
and long-term cost-effectiveness ratios. Our primary outcome was 1-year cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: From the hospital payer's perspective, delivery of the OMSC can be 
considered cost effective with 1-year cost per QALY gained of $C1386, and 
lifetime cost per QALY gained of $C68. In the first year, we calculated that 
provision of the OMSC to 15 326 smokers would generate 4689 quitters, and would 
prevent 116 rehospitalisations, 923 hospital days, and 119 deaths. Results were 
robust within numerous sensitivity analyses.
DISCUSSION: The OMSC appears to be cost-effective from the hospital payer 
perspective. Important consideration is the relatively low intervention cost 
compared to the reduction in costs related to readmissions for illnesses 
associated with continued smoking.

Surgery remains the first choice intervention in patients with severe 
symptomatic carotid stenosis. Stenting is associated with a higher 
periprocedural risk of stroke compared with surgery. This excess risk of stroke 
with stenting mainly concerns patients older than 70years, whereas the risk 
seems to be similar in patients younger than 70years. After the procedural 
period, both surgery and stenting appear to be as effective to prevent stroke. 
Studies are ongoing to identify patients who benefit most from carotid surgery 
or stenting. In patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the risk of first 
ipsilateral stroke on medical treatment alone is currently lower (less than 1% 
per year) than it was at the time of randomized clinical trials, which showed a 
modest benefit of carotid surgery over medical treatment alone. Randomized 
trials are ongoing to re-assess the benefit of carotid revascularization in 
patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Pending results of these trials, 
carotid revascularization should remain a case by case decision, taking into 
account the individual risk of ispilateral stroke, the risk of 
revascularization, the predicted life expectancy, and patient's preferences.
