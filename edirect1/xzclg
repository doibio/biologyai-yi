simulations created the opportunity for the introduction of dynamic parameters 
in cardiac surgery. Our aim was to apply 3D models in cardiac surgical practice, 
predicting fluid dynamic results, ventricular shape, volume and function before 
the operation.
METHODS: Using a script developed by us, the raw DICOM files were imported, the 
dilated left ventricle was modeled and fluid dynamic parameters were simulated, 
such as flow kinematic and profile analysis, turbulence calculation and 
myocardial response to shear stress. Then step-by-step simulation of the 
surgical ventricle restoration procedure was accomplished and the calculated 
variables were imbedded in silico model. The length of resection lines was 
modified based on the previous computer simulation and applied during the 
operation, if feasible.
RESULTS: The sphericity and conicity indexes were improved significantly in 
postoperative period (0.42 vs. 0.67 and 0.36 vs. 0.72, p < 0.05). The occurred 
shear stress at endocardium decreased 83% due to the normalization of flow 
kinematic pattern of the ventricle in postoperative period (132.21 ± 29.5 
dyne/cm2 vs. 22.92 ± 10.3 p < 0.05 dyne/‌cm2). The postoperative turbulent flow 
pattern significantly decreased, according to our computational method (2712 vs. 
1823, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: With our method, the standardization of the surgical ventricle 
reconstruction was achievable and the surgical steps were predictable. 
Therefore, a new decision making support system was established in cardiac 
surgery for high risk patients. A personalized surgical technique was offered to 
our patients, improving their life expectancy and quality of life.

Publisher: Absztrakt: Bevezetés: A sebészi diszciplínákban a műtétetek 
megtervezése statikus modelleken alapulnak. Azonban a számítástechnikai 
fejlődése lehetőséget nyitott a dinamikus modellek preoperatív megtervezésére és 
intraoperatív alkalmazásukra. Célunk volt, olyan döntéstámogató rendszer 
megalkotása a szívsebészeti gyakorlatban, melynek segítségével az áramlástani, 
kamramorfológiai, térfogat és posztoperatív kamrafunkció predikcióját 
végezhetjük kamrarekonstrukciós műtéteknél. Módszerek: Saját fejlesztésű 
szoftver használatával DICOM fájlok importálását követően a dilatált bal kamrát 
három dimenzióban modellezzük. Ezt követő áramlástani modellezések segítségével 
az idővel és a kamratérfogat változásával dinamikusan változó paramétereket: az 
áramlástani profilt, turbulenciát és a bal kamrában fellépő nyíróerők hatását a 
myocardium funkciójára kiszámítjuk. In silico modellben – a prediktált adatokat 
felhasználva – megtervezzük a balkamra-rekonstrukciós műtét egyes lépéseit. A 
tervezés alapján a kiszámított rezekciós vonalak hosszát alkalmazva történtek a 
műtétek. Eredmények: Összesen 50 esetben történt 3D tervezés. A bal kamra 
geometriáját jellemző konicitási és sphericitási indexek szignifikánsan javultak 
a műtétet követően (0,42 vs. 0,67 és 0,36 vs. 0,72, p < 0,05). A bal kamra 
izomzatára ható nyíróerő szignifikánsan 83%-kal csökkent, illetve a kamra 
turbulens áramlásprofilja szignifikánsan javult (2712 vs. 1823, p < 0,05). 
Következésképpen a szív pumpafunkciója javult a műtétet követően. Konklúzió: 
Technikánk alkalmazásával a balkamra-rekonstrukciós műtétek egyes lépéseinek 
standardizálásával és e lépések intraoperatív alkalmazásának kidolgozásával 
sikerült egy új sebészi döntéstámogató rendszert létrehoznunk. Az így 
megtervezett és személyre szabott műtétekkel növelhettük ezen magas kockázatú 
betegcsoport posztoperatív életminőségét és túlélését.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to conduct a 
comprehensive assessment of economic evaluations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in middle- and 
high-income countries.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Embase, MEDLINE (via PubMed) and 
the Cochrane library on March 3, 2018 to identify economic evaluations of 
chronic myeloid leukemia that met the inclusion criteria. Data on such 
parameters as patient characteristics, cost components, and main outcomes were 
extracted from eligible studies.
RESULTS: The literature review retrieved 798 studies, 17 of which fulfilled the 
eligibility criteria. Eight studies included an economic analysis on newly 
diagnosed patients with CML. Seven studies investigated people with CML who were 
resistant or intolerant to standard-dose imatinib. One article focused on 
chronic phase (CP)-CML patients who experienced failure with first-line 
treatment for interferon-α. The last study investigated advanced stages of CML 
patients. Most studies (n = 70.6%) were conducted in high-income countries. Only 
five studies (n = 29.4%) were performed in middle-income countries. Most studies 
used a Markov model. The time horizon varied from six months to life-time.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite high costs, the included studies indicate that imatinib 
regimens are cost effective in newly diagnosed patients with CP-CML. For people 
with CML who are resistant or intolerant to standard-dose imatinib, dasatinib is 
likely to be a more cost-effective strategy in middle-income countries. More 
studies are necessary to assess the long-term efficacy and cost effectiveness of 
novel treatment options.

The effect of different strength training regimes, and in particular training 
utilizing brief explosive contractions, on tendinous tissue properties is poorly 
understood. This study compared the efficacy of 12 weeks of knee extensor 
explosive-contraction (ECT; n = 14) vs. sustained-contraction (SCT; n = 15) 
strength training vs. a non-training control (n = 13) to induce changes in 
patellar tendon and knee extensor tendon-aponeurosis stiffness and size 
(patellar tendon, vastus-lateralis aponeurosis, quadriceps femoris muscle) in 
healthy young men. Training involved 40 isometric knee extension contractions 
(three times/week): gradually increasing to 75% of maximum voluntary torque 
(MVT) before holding for 3 s (SCT), or briefly contracting as fast as possible 
to ∼80% MVT (ECT). Changes in patellar tendon stiffness and Young's modulus, 
tendon-aponeurosis complex stiffness, as well as quadriceps femoris muscle 
volume, vastus-lateralis aponeurosis area and patellar tendon cross-sectional 
area were quantified with ultrasonography, dynamometry, and magnetic resonance 
imaging. ECT and SCT similarly increased patellar tendon stiffness (20% vs. 16%, 
both p < 0.05 vs. control) and Young's modulus (22% vs. 16%, both p < 0.05 vs. 
control). Tendon-aponeurosis complex high-force stiffness increased only after 
SCT (21%; p < 0.02), while ECT resulted in greater overall elongation of the 
tendon-aponeurosis complex. Quadriceps muscle volume only increased after 
sustained-contraction training (8%; p = 0.001), with unclear effects of strength 
training on aponeurosis area. The changes in patellar tendon cross-sectional 
area after strength training were not appreciably different to control. Our 
results suggest brief high force muscle contractions can induce increased free 
tendon stiffness, though SCT is needed to increase tendon-aponeurosis complex 
stiffness and muscle hypertrophy.

The prediction of therapy-benefit for individual cardiovascular disease 
prevention: rationale, implications, and implementation.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to outline the importance and the clinical 
implications of using predicted individual therapy-benefit in making 
patient-centered treatment decisions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. 
Therapy-benefit concepts will be illustrated with examples of patients 
undergoing lipid management.
RECENT FINDINGS: In both primary and secondary CVD prevention, the degree of 
variation in individual therapy-benefit is large. An individual's 
therapy-benefit can be estimated by combining prediction algorithms and clinical 
trial data. Measures of therapy-benefit can be easily integrated into clinical 
practice via a variety of online calculators. Lifetime estimates (e.g., gain in 
healthy life expectancy) look at therapy-benefit over the course of an 
individual's life, and are less influenced by age than short-term estimates 
(e.g., 10-year absolute risk reduction). Lifetime estimates can thus identify 
people who could substantially benefit from early initiation of CVD prevention. 
Compared with current guidelines, treatment based on predicted therapy-benefit 
would increase eligibility for therapy among young people with a moderate 
risk-factor burden and individuals with a high residual risk.
SUMMARY: The estimation of individual therapy-benefit is an important part of 
individualized medicine. Implementation tools allow for clinicians to readily 
estimate both short-term and lifetime therapy-benefit.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the value of coformulated 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for preexposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) for conception in the U.S. and to identify scenarios in which 
'Undetectable = Untransmittable' (U = U) may not be adequate, and rather, PrEP 
or assisted reproduction would improve outcomes.
DESIGN: We developed a Markov cohort simulation model to estimate the 
incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness of PrEP compared with alternative 
safer conception strategies, including combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) 
alone for the HIV-infected partner and assisted reproductive technologies. We 
modelled various scenarios in which HIV RNA suppression in the male partner was 
less than perfect.
SETTING: U.S. healthcare sector perspective.
PARTICIPANTS: Serodiscordant couples in the U.S. was composed of an HIV-infected 
male and HIV-uninfected female seeking conception.
INTERVENTION: Economic analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cumulative risks of HIV transmission to women and 
babies, maternal life expectancy, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALY), 
discounted lifetime medical costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: cART with condomless intercourse limited to ovulation was the preferred 
HIV prevention strategy among women seeking to conceive with an HIV-infected 
partner who is HIV-suppressed. PrEP was not cost-effective for women who had 
partners who were virologically suppressed. When the probability of male partner 
HIV suppression was low and we assumed generic pricing of PrEP, PrEP was 
cost-effective, and sometimes even cost-saving compared with cART alone.
CONCLUSION: From a U.S. healthcare sector perspective, when the male partner was 
not reliably suppressed, PrEP became economically attractive, and in some cases, 
cost-saving.

The aim of this work was to quantify the prevalence and years lived with 
disability (YLDs) caused by low back pain (LBP) in China from 1990 to 2016. Data 
from the GBD 2016 (Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2016) were used. We analyzed the age-sex-province-specific prevalence and YLDs 
for LBP of 33 provinces/regions in China. Comparisons were made with the data 
retrieved from the 1990 GBD study. We estimated that 5.45 × 10 individuals had 
LBP in 1990, which rose to 6.73 × 10 in 2016. The age-standardized prevalence of 
LBP decreased from 5.6% (95% uncertainty interval [95% UI]: 4.9%-6.3%) in 1990 
to 4.2% (95% UI: 3.8%-4.8%) in 2016. The YLDs for LBP increased from 6.2 million 
(95% UI: 4.3-8.3 million) in 1990 to 7.7 million (95% UI: 5.4-10.2) in 2016. 
Age-standardized YLD rate (per 100,000 person) decreased from 637.5 (95% UI: 
449.9-848.8) in 1990 to 481.9 (95% UI: 338.6-637.0) in 2016. A female 
preponderance was observed for prevalence and YLDs. The prevalence and YLDs rate 
for LBP slightly decreased from 1990 to 2016 in China; however, the total 
individuals and YLDs increased. Low back pain still ranks as the second leading 
cause of YLD burden disease in China. Considerable attention should be paid for 
LBP, especially in the female population.

CDC Grand Rounds: Promoting Well-Being and Independence in Older Adults.

Olivari BS, Baumgart M, Lock SL, Whiting CG, Taylor CA, Iskander J, Thorpe P, 
McGuire LC.

Healthy aging is not merely the absence of disease or disability, but requires 
physical and mental health and ongoing social engagement (1). As the average 
U.S. life expectancy increases, recognition that public health can play a vital 
role in promoting healthy, successful aging even in the face of increased 
prevalence of chronic diseases, including types of dementia, among older adults 
(i.e., aged ≥65 years) has grown. Furthermore, actively engaging adults in 
prevention and wellness along with involving their caregivers (i.e., the family 
and friends of older adults who provide them with unpaid and informal support 
and services) can serve to prevent or delay the onset of physical disabilities 
and cognitive decline. Adults often are reluctant to discuss their concerns 
about worsening memory with their health care providers although such 
discussions can lead to earlier diagnosis and better care, planning, and 
support. As advances in public health and health care have helped increase life 
expectancy, public health professionals and health care providers have the 
opportunity to improve the quality of life for older adults and their caregivers 
and reduce the burdens associated with aging.

AIM: The aim of this study was to examine a potential ethnic disparity in the 
phenotype of polycythaemia vera (PV) between New Zealand European and Polynesian 
patients.
METHOD: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted at Middlemore 
Hospital to identify adult patients with PV diagnosed between 1987 and 2007. 
Data extracted included diagnostic criteria, ethnicity, age, complications and 
survival.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight adult patients with PV were identified during 1987-2007, 
49 (55.7%) were Europeans and 36 (40.9%) Polynesians. The most striking finding 
was that Polynesian patients presented almost 14 years younger than Europeans 
(mean age of 54 years versus [vs] 68, respectively; P<.001). The white cell and 
platelet counts were higher in Polynesians compared with Europeans (mean white 
cell count of 22x109/L vs 13x109/L; mean platelet count of 648x109/L vs 
512x109/L, respectively; P<.05 for both). The rate of JAK2 V617F mutation in 
Polynesians was 96%, equivalent to other large cohorts of European patients. The 
rates of long-term complications were comparable between Polynesians and 
Europeans, but the predicted impact on life expectancy was more severe for 
Polynesians.
CONCLUSION: New Zealand Polynesian patients present with a distinctive PV 
phenotype. Their younger age at presentation suggests a different risk factor 
profile or a higher genetic susceptibility. We hope our observations initiate 
larger epidemiological and genetic studies to help elucidate the cause.

Due to the rapidly increasing life-expectancy, the prevalence of glaucoma has 
increased steadily in recent years. We aimed to evaluate the patterns of care 
and primary treatment strategy patterns in Korea according to glaucoma subtypes 
to assess the quality of care for glaucoma patients.In this serial 
cross-sectional survey, the claims data from the Korean National Health 
Insurance Service was used to identify and group glaucoma patients into primary 
open-angle glaucoma (POAG), primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), other types 
of glaucoma, and ocular hypertension from 2002 to 2013. Records for outpatient 
visits, hospitalizations, drug prescriptions, admissions, and surgical 
interventions were used to determine the patterns of care and identify primary 
treatment strategies.Both the prevalence (0.11% in 2002 to 0.43% in 2013) and 
incidence rates (0.06% in 2003 to 0.11% in 2013) for glaucoma increased over 
time. The mean number of outpatient visits increased (4.9-6.0 visits per year), 
while the proportion of hospitalized patients (2.3-1.0% of patients) and 
duration of hospital stay (4.5-3.4 days among hospitalized patients) decreased 
between 2002 and 2013 for patients with POAG. The proportion of patients not 
being managed by medication or surgery decreased, with POAG and PACG patients 
receiving medications increasing from 70.9% and 59.2% in 2002 to 88.4% and 63.3% 
in 2013, respectively. Finally, while the proportion of trabeculectomy decreased 
(22.2% to 10.0% of surgical procedures in 2002 and 2013, respectively), more 
patients with PACG have received iridectomy (59.3% to 86.0% of surgical 
procedures in 2002 and 2013, respectively).Between 2002 and 2013, the pattern of 
care for both patients with POAG and PACG has shifted toward management by 
outpatient visits and intervention with anti-glaucoma medications in Korea.

Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.

Cost-effectiveness is 1 of the most important factors in medicine reimbursement, 
and social willingness to pay (WTP) can provide evidence for the threshold of 
cost-effectiveness analysis. Recently, the concept of curative medicines has 
been introduced, so it is necessary to study their cost-effectiveness. This 
study aimed to estimate WTP per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for a cure in 
the Korean general population.A total of 507 people from the general population, 
proportionally assigned by sex, age, and region, participated in face-to-face 
interviews. The contingent valuation survey was conducted with scenarios 
involving 4 EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) with different health statuses. We 
assumed a treatment that moved the health status of each scenario to perfect 
health. WTP for 1 year of treatment was derived using a double-bounded format 
followed by open-ended answers. In the cure scenario, the post-treatment effect 
continued for a lifetime; in the non-cure scenario, the effect instantly stopped 
when treatment was terminated. Additionally, prolonged treatment effects lasting 
5 and 10 years were added. To identify the factors influencing WTP, a 
multi-level analysis was performed.WTP per QALY for the non-cure scenario was 
KRW 15 million/QALY. For the cure scenario, WTP was 2.3 times higher (KRW 
35 million/QALY) than in the non-cure scenario. The results for the prolonged 
treatment effect scenarios were KRW 22 million/QALY and KRW 27 million/QALY, 
which are 1.4 and 1.8 times higher than the non-cure scenario, respectively. In 
all scenarios, the statistically significant factors affecting WTP per QALY were 
higher education, higher household income, and healthcare provider.This study 
revealed that WTP for a cure treatment was higher than that for non-cure; this 
higher WTP should be considered in future decision-making regarding curative 
treatments.

There is a growing recognition of the role of built environment attributes, such 
as streets, shops, greenways, parks, and public transportation stations, in 
supporting people's active behaviors. In particular, surrounding built 
environments may have an important role in supporting healthy active aging. 
Nevertheless, little is known about how built environments may influence active 
lifestyles in "super-aged societies". More robust evidence-based research is 
needed to identify how where people live influences their active behaviors, and 
how to build beneficial space in the context of super-aged societies. This 
evidence will also be informative for the broader international context, where 
having an aging society will be the inevitable future. This commentary sought to 
move this research agenda forward by identifying key research issues and 
challenges in examining the role of built environment attributes on active 
behaviors in Japan, which is experiencing the longest healthy life expectancy, 
but rapid "super-aging", with the highest proportion of old adults among its 
population in the world.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess temporal trends and outcomes of 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in nonagenarians.
BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy, nonagenarians requiring PCI are 
increasing even though outcomes data are limited.
METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample was used to identify all hospitalizations 
for PCI in patients aged ≥90 years from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2014. 
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: Nonagenarians (n = 69,271) constituted 0.9% of all PCI 
hospitalizations, increasing from 0.6% in 2003 to 2004 to 1.4% in 2013 to 2014 
(ptrend < 0.001). From 2003-2004 to 2013-2014, the proportion of PCIs performed 
for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (23.1% to 30.9%) and 
non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (49.6% to 52.6%) increased, 
whereas those for stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) decreased (27.3% to 
16.5%), respectively (ptrend < 0.001 for all). Overall in-hospital mortality 
after PCI for STEMI, non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes, and SIHD 
were 16.4%, 4.2%, and 1.8%, respectively. After multivariable risk adjustment 
for demographics, comorbidities, and hospital-level characteristics, in-hospital 
mortality remained unchanged in STEMI (odds ratio: 1.04; 95% confidence 
interval: 0.98 to 1.11; ptrend = 0.20) and non-ST-segment elevation acute 
coronary syndromes (odds ratio: 0.99; 95% confidence interval: 0.91 to 1.08; 
ptrend = 0.82), but increased in SIHD (odds ratio: 1.21; 95% confidence 
interval: 1.01 to 1.44; ptrend = 0.04) from 2003 to 2004 to 2013 to 2014. The 
rates of bleeding and vascular complications decreased or remained stable in all 
3 subgroups, whereas risk-adjusted incidence of stroke increased in patients 
with STEMI or SIHD.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of in-hospital mortality, major bleeding, vascular 
complications, and stroke after PCI in nonagenarians changed significantly from 
2003 to 2014. This study provides a benchmark for discussion of PCI-related 
risks among physicians, patients, and families.

Since its founding in 1993 the TraumaRegister DGU® has become one of the largest 
registries especially in terms of data diversity. Since the introduction of the 
TraumaNetzwerk DGU®, the TraumaRegister DGU® has enabled a quasi-nationwide 
picture of the quality of care of severely injured patients in Germany. The 
register is subject to constant development, under the guidance of the working 
groups of the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU). The first modular 
expansion of special injury entities (craniocerebral trauma and complex hand 
injuries) is currently taking place. The future developments will involve the 
extension of the register to certain injury patterns. The existing registry will 
also be supplemented with other recorded qualities (from the supplementary serum 
database up to the quality of life). This makes the TraumaRegister DGU® a tool 
for quality assurance and science which is well prepared for the future.

Conventional dialysis in the elderly: How lenient should our guidelines be?

Corbett RW(1), Brown EA(1).

Author information:

College Healthcare NHS, London, UK.

There has been a dramatic, worldwide expansion in life expectancy across the 
last century. This has resulted in a progressively more elderly and comorbid 
population. It is increasingly recognized that healthcare in this group needs to 
move to the concept of "adding life to years". Recognition and assessment of 
frailty is vital in changing our approach in elderly patients. Current 
guidelines in dialysis have a limited evidence base across all age groups, but 
particularly the elderly and serve them poorly. Moreover, the burden of 
guidelines for each comorbidity of the multimorbid patient is increasing and can 
be conflicting. Finally, there is increasing evidence relating to the harm 
associated with the delivery of conventional dialysis. In dialysis patients, 
frailty is the overwhelming determinant in relation to patient-specific outcomes 
rather than modality of treatment; therefore, the focus should be on promoting 
quality of life. We need to focus on new priorities of care when we design 
guidelines "for people not diseases". Patient-centered goal-directed therapy, 
arising from shared decision making between physician and patient, should allow 
adaption of the dialysis regime to maximize opportunities while minimizing 
treatment-related morbidity and concentrating on alleviating symptoms.

Long-Term Care for Older Adults in ASEAN Plus Three: The Roles of Family, 
Community, and the State in Addressing Unmet Eldercare Needs.

Yeung WJ(1), Thang LL(1).

Author information:
(1)1 National University of Singapore, Singapore.

OBJECTIVE: To introduce this Special Issue that focuses on understanding the 
issues surrounding the long-term care (LTC) in selected societies in Southeast 
and East Asian countries.
METHOD: We first provide demographic and socioeconomic context for these 
countries and then summarize the seven articles in this issue.
RESULTS: The articles highlight the rapidly rising demand for LTC in this region 
in the next few decades given the declining fertility, lengthening life 
expectancy, and increasing migration. They also discuss challenges and 
strategies in meeting these demands. Most countries are ill prepared to cope 
with the demand for LTC with older adults heavily rely upon female family 
members for care. Elderly women in low-income households have the greatest unmet 
need.
DISCUSSION: Home-based and community-based services are set to become an 
integral part of the LTC system. It is important to incorporate older adults' 
cultural norms and wishes in their care plan and provision.

As a traditional Chinese medicine, Ganoderma lingzhi has attracted increasing 
attention for both scientific research and medical application. In this work, in 
order to improve the production of polysaccharides from an original wide-type 
(WT) strain (named "RWY-0") of Ganoderma lingzhi, we applied 
atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) nonthermal plasma to the 
protoplasts of RWY-0 for mutagenesis treatment. Through a randomly amplified 
polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay, at least 10 mutagenic strains were confirmed. They 
also showed different mycelium characteristics in terms of shape, color, size 
and biomass in liquid fermentation. The mutant strains were examined by infrared 
spectroscopy, and based on the established near-infrared (NIR) quantification 
model, the polysaccharide contents in these mutants were quantitatively 
evaluated. As a result, we found that the Ganoderma polysaccharide contents in 
some of the mutant strains were significantly changed compared with that of the 
original WT strain. The polysaccharide content of RWY-1 G. lingzhi was 
considerably higher than that of the WT strain, with an increase of 25.6%. Thus, 
this preliminary work demonstrates the extension of the plasma mutagenesis 
application in acquiring polysaccharide-enhanced Ganoderma lingzhi mutants and 
shows the usefulness of NIR spectroscopy in the rapid screening of mutagenic 
strains for other important ingredients.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease patients are reported to have higher survival 
rate compared to patients with vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies. 
There is a paucity of studies investigating survival including persons with 
cognitive decline and dementia of various aetiologies.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare survival for patients with subjective cognitive 
decline, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, 
mixed Alzheimer's/vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's 
disease, and other dementias compared to the general Norwegian population, 
taking into account the role of gender, cognitive function, function in everyday 
activities, comorbidity and education.
METHODS: Patients (N = 4682), ≥65 years, in the The Norwegian register of 
persons assessed for cognitive symptoms (NorCog) during 2009-2017 were followed 
for mortality in the National Registry until January 2018. Flexible parametric 
survival models were applied to estimate relative survival, life expectancy and 
years of life lost for diagnostic groups compared with the general population.
RESULTS: Patients with vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy 
bodies/Parkinson's had the shortest survival, followed by mixed dementia, 
Alzheimer's disease, unspecified dementia, mild cognitive impairment and 
subjective cognitive decline. At age 70 years, men with vascular dementia or 
dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's had life expectancy of 4.7 years, which 
corresponded to 10.3 years of life lost compared to the general population. 
Years of life lost for other diagnoses were 10.0 years for mixed dementia, 9.2 
years for Alzheimer's disease, 9.3 years for other dementias, 5.2 years for mild 
cognitive impairment and 2.2 years for subjective cognitive decline. 
Corresponding years of life lost in women were: 12.7 years, 10.5 years, 9.8 
years, 10.6 years, 7.8 years, and 2.6 years. Poor relative survival among 
dementia patients was associated with male gender, comorbidity, low cognitive 
function, and low function in activities of daily living.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the general population, patients with subjective 
cognitive decline had no significant loss in life expectancy, while patients 
with mild cognitive impairment and all dementia subtypes had large losses, 
especially those with a diagnosis of vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy 
bodies/Parkinson's.

The most frequent site of ocular metastasis is the choroid. The occurrence of 
choroidal metastases has increased steadily due to the longer survival of 
metastatic patients and the improvement of diagnostic tools. Fundoscopy, 
ultrasonography, and fluorescein angiography are now complemented by indocyanine 
green angiography and optical coherence tomography. Choroidal tumor biopsy may 
also confirm the metastatic nature of the tumor and help to determine the site 
of the primary malignancy. There is currently no consensus on the treatment 
strategy. Most patients have a limited life expectancy and for these complex 
treatments are generally not recommended. However, recent advances in systemic 
therapy have significantly improved survival of certain patients who may benefit 
from an aggressive ocular approach that could preserve vision. Although external 
beam radiation therapy is the most widely used treatment, more advanced forms of 
radiotherapy that are associated with fewer side effects can be proposed in 
select cases. In patients with a shorter life expectancy, systemic therapies 
such as those targeting oncogenic drivers, or immunotherapy can induce a 
regression of the choroidal metastases, and may be sufficient to temporarily 
decrease visual symptoms. However, they often acquire resistance to systemic 
treatment and ocular relapse usually requires radiotherapy for durable control. 
Less invasive office-based treatments, such as photodynamic therapy and 
intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF, may also help to preserve vision while 
reducing time spent in medical settings for patients in palliative care. The aim 
of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on choroidal metastases, 
with emphasis on the most recent findings in epidemiology, pathogenesis, 
diagnosis and treatment.

PURPOSE: The understanding of patients with cancer of their condition and their 
wishes regarding care as they approach end of life (EoL) have been studied more 
in high-income countries than in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were analyzed from a cohort study (N = 221) of 
patients with advanced cancer who were recruited from a palliative care center 
in Soweto, South Africa (LMIC), between May 2016 and June 2017. Patients were 
asked about their understanding of their illness, estimated life expectancy, EoL 
care communication, and EoL care preferences.
RESULTS: Only 13 patients (5.9%) acknowledged that they were terminally ill; 
nine patients (4.1%) estimated accurately that they had months, not years, left 
to live. A total of 216 patients (97.7%) reported that they had not had an EoL 
care discussion with their physician, and 170 patients (76.9%) did not want to 
know their prognosis even if the doctor knew it. Most patients preferred comfort 
care (72.9%; n = 161) to life-extending care (14.0%; n = 31), and did not want 
to be kept alive using extreme measures (80.5%; n = 178) or have their doctors 
do everything possible to extend their lives (78.3%; n = 173). Finally, 127 
patients (57.5%) preferred to die at home, and 51 (23.1%) preferred to die in 
the hospital. Most patients (81.0%; n = 179) had funeral plans.
CONCLUSION: South African patients demonstrated less awareness of the fact that 
they were terminally ill, were less likely to have discussed their prognosis 
with their doctor, and more strongly preferred comfort care to life-extending 
EoL care than US and other LMIC patients in prior research. These differences 
highlight the need for culturally appropriate, patient-centered EoL care for 
South African patients with advanced cancer as well as to determine individual 
preferences and needs in all EoL settings.

Evidence From Ghana Indicates That Childhood Cancer Treatment in Sub-Saharan 
Africa Is Very Cost Effective: A Report From the Childhood Cancer 2030 Network.

Sick Children, Toronto; Sue Horton, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, 
Canada; and Nickhill Bhakta, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.

PURPOSE: No published study to date has examined total cost and 
cost-effectiveness of maintaining a pediatric oncology treatment center in an 
African setting, thus limiting childhood cancer advocacy and policy efforts.
METHODS: Within the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana, costing data 
were gathered for all inputs related to operating a pediatric cancer unit. Cost 
and volume data for relevant clinical services (eg, laboratory, pathology, 
medications) were obtained retrospectively or prospectively. Salaries were 
determined and multiplied by proportion of time dedicated toward pediatric 
patients with cancer. Costs associated with inpatient bed use, outpatient clinic 
use, administrative fees, and overhead were estimated. Costs were summed for a 
total annual operating cost. Cost-effectiveness was calculated based on annual 
patients with newly diagnosed disease, survival rates, and life expectancy.
RESULTS: The Korle Bu Teaching Hospital pediatric cancer unit treats on average 
170 new diagnoses annually. Total operating cost was $1.7 million/y. Personnel 
salaries and operating room costs were the most expensive inputs, contributing 
45% and 21% of total costs. Together, medications, imaging, radiation, and 
pathology services accounted for 7%. The cost per disability-adjusted life-year 
averted was $1,034, less than the Ghanaian per capita income, and thus 
considered very cost effective as per WHO-CHOICE methodology.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine 
institution-level costs and cost-effectiveness of a childhood cancer program in 
an African setting, demonstrating that operating such a program in this setting 
is very cost effective. These results will inform national childhood cancer 
strategies in Africa and other low- and middle-income country settings.
