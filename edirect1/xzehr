The article, which reviews some aspects of public health in Austria, Belgium, 
Germany and Estonia, highlights the achievements of public health in these 
countries, which is expressed in an increase in life expectancy, primarily due 
to a reduction in mortality from cardiovascular diseases. In the countries 
listed above, there is a difference in life expectancy, both between men and 
women, and between people with higher and basic education. There is still an 
urgent problem of the prevalence of risk factors - smoking and alcohol 
consumption, while the level of physical activity of residents of the designated 
countries can be called high. The fight against risk factors in these States is 
carried out, among other things, through the implementation of screening 
programs. The digital transformation in healthcare in Austria, Belgium, Germany 
and Estonia is also intensifying. A significant part of medical data, including 
informational and educational materials, is now available to the public in 
digital format.

The confident detection of metastatic bone disease is essential to improve 
patients' comfort and increase life expectancy. Multi-parametric magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) has been successfully used for monitoring of metastatic 
bone disease, allowing for comprehensive and holistic evaluation of the total 
tumour volume and treatment response assessment. The major challenges of 
radiological reading of whole-body MRI come from the amount of data to be 
reviewed and the scattered distribution of metastases, often of complex shapes. 
This makes bone lesion detection and quantification demanding for a radiologist 
and prone to error. Additionally, whole-body MRI are often corrupted with 
multiple spatial and intensity distortions, which further degrade the 
performance of image reading and image processing algorithms. In this work we 
propose a fully automated computer-aided diagnosis system for the detection and 
segmentation of metastatic bone disease using whole-body multi-parametric MRI. 
The system consists of an extensive image preprocessing pipeline aiming at 
enhancing the image quality, followed by a deep learning framework for detection 
and segmentation of metastatic bone disease. The system outperformed 
state-of-the-art methodologies, achieving a detection sensitivity of 63% with a 
mean of 6.44 false positives per image, and an average lesion Dice coefficient 
of 0.53. A provided ablation study performed to investigate the relative 
importance of image preprocessing shows that introduction of region of interest 
mask and spatial registration have a significant impact on detection and 
segmentation performance in whole-body MRI. The proposed computer-aided 
diagnosis system allows for automatic quantification of disease infiltration and 
could provide a valuable tool during radiological examination of whole-body MRI.

The execution of the edible coatings and films for food preservation; 
vegetables, fruits, meat, and dry fruits has been ladened in history. The study 
of literature portrays enough pieces of evidence dating back from centuries of 
coatings or films being utilized for the conservation of numerous fruits and 
vegetables to stretch their average shelf-life. The mechanism that remains 
operative in extending the shelf-life of fruits and vegetables beyond the normal 
shelf-life is the controlled entry and exit of moisture and gases. The non- 
biodegradable packaging which is also non-sustainable can be substituted with 
compostable and edible coatings and films made up of natural biopolymers. 
Therefore, keeping in mind the environment and consumer safety, a score of 
research has been going on from former decades for the development of edible 
coatings and films with efficient shelf life-extending qualities. The films 
composed of proteins exhibit a good mechanical strength while the polysaccharide 
composed films and coatings show efficient gas blocking qualities, however, both 
lack moisture shielding attributes. These shortcomings can be fixed by combining 
them with lipids and or some appropriate hydrocolloids. The edible coatings and 
films have been integrated with various food products; however, they haven't 
been completely successful in substitution of the total fraction of their 
non-edible counterparts. The implementation of edible coatings and films have 
shown to serve an immense value in extending the shelf-life of fruits and 
vegetables along with being a sustainable and eco-friendly approach for food 
packaging.

OBJECTIVE: Women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) who are at an increased 
risk of presenting with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) and have 
different responses to treatment compared with non-Hispanic White males yet are 
underrepresented in PAD research.
METHODS: ELEGANCE is a global, prospective, multi-center, post-market registry 
of PAD patients treated with drug-eluting device that aims to enroll at least 
40% women and 40% URMs. The study design incorporates strategies to increase 
enrollment of women and URMs. Inclusion criteria are age ≥18 years and treatment 
with any commercially available Boston Scientific Corporation drug-eluting 
device marketed for peripheral vasculature lesions; exclusion criterion is life 
expectancy <1 year.
RESULTS: Of 750 patients currently enrolled (951 lesions) across 39 sites, 324 
(43.2%) are female and 350 (47.3%) are URMs (21.6% Black, 11.2% Asian, 8.5% 
Hispanic/Latino, and 5.3% other). Rutherford classification is distributed 
differently between sexes (P = .019). Treatment indication differs among 
race/ethnicity groups (P = .003). Chronic limb-threatening ischemia was higher 
for Black (38.3%) and Hispanic/Latino (28.1%) patients compared with 
non-Hispanic White (21.8%) and Asian patients (21.4%). De-novo stenosis was 
higher in Asian patients (92.3%) compared with Black, non-Hispanic White, and 
Hispanic/Latino patients (72.2%, 68.7%, and 77.8%, respectively; P < .001). Mean 
lesion length was longest for Black patients (162.7 mm), then non-Hispanic White 
(135.2 mm), Asian (134.8 mm), and Hispanic/Latino patients (128.1 mm; P = .008).
CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of data from the ELEGANCE registry show that differences 
exist in baseline disease characteristics by sex and race/ethnicity; these may 
be the result of other underlying factors, including time to diagnosis, burden 
of undermanaged comorbidities, and access to care.

BACKGROUND: Active surveillance may be considered for low-risk basal cell 
carcinomas (BCCs) in patients with limited life expectancy; however, estimates 
of life expectancy are not readily available. Veterans Health Administration's 
Care Assessment Need (CAN) score may address this problem.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the CAN score's performance in predicting 1-, 3-, and 
5-year mortality in US veterans with BCC.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used national Veterans Health 
Administration's electronic medical record data. The CAN score's performance in 
the prediction of mortality in veterans with BCC was evaluated based on tests of 
goodness-of-fit, discrimination, and calibration.
RESULTS: For 54,744 veterans with BCC treatment encounters between 2013 and 
2018, the CAN score performed well in the prediction of mortality based on 
multiple tests. A threshold CAN score of 90 had a positive predictive value of 
55% for 3-year mortality, clinically useful in identifying patients with 
intermediate-term survival.
LIMITATIONS: The study relied upon the combination of diagnosis codes and 
procedure codes to identify BCC cases.
CONCLUSION: The CAN score has the potential to improve the quality of cancer 
care for veterans by providing clinicians with an estimate of life expectancy 
and facilitating conversations in cases where active surveillance can be 
considered.

BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of comprehensive studies examining the burden and 
trends of hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and high systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) among the Australian population. We aimed to explore the burden of HHD and 
high SBP, and how they changed over time from 1990 to 2019 in Australia.
METHODS: We analysed data from the Global Burden of Disease study in Australia. 
We assessed the prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALY), 
years lived with disability (YLD) and years of life lost (YLL) attributable to 
HHD and high SBP. Data were presented as point estimates with 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UI). We compared the burden of HHD and high SBP in Australia with 
World Bank defined high-income countries and six other comparator countries with 
similar sociodemographic characteristics and economies.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the burden of HHD and high SBP in Australia reduced. 
Age standardised prevalence rate of HHD was 119.3 cases per 100,000 people (95% 
UI 86.6-161.0) in 1990, compared to 80.1 cases (95% UI 57.4-108.1) in 2019. 
Deaths due to HDD were 3.4 cases per 100,000 population (95% UI 2.6-3.8) in 
1990, compared to 2.5 (95% UI 1.9-3.0) in 2019. HHD contributed to 57.2 (95% UI 
46.6-64.7) DALYs per 100,000 population in 1990 compared to 38.4 (95% UI 
32.0-45.2) in 2019. Death rates per 100,000 population attributable to high SBP 
declined significantly over time for both sexes from 1990 (155.6 cases; 95% UI 
131.2-177.0) to approximately one third in 2019 (53.8 cases; 95% UI 43.4-64.4). 
Compared to six other countries in 2019, the prevalence of HHD was highest in 
the USA (274.3%) and lowest in the UK (52.6%), with Australia displaying the 
third highest prevalence. Australia ranked second in term of lowest rates of 
deaths and third for lowest DALYs respectively due to high SBP. From 1990-2019, 
Australia ranked third best for reductions in deaths and DALYs due to HHD and 
first for reductions in deaths and DALYs due to high SBP.
CONCLUSION: Over the past three decades, the burden of HHD in Australia has 
reduced, but its prevalence remains relatively high. The contribution of high 
SBP to deaths, DALYs and YLLs also reduced over the three decades.

Objective: To analyze the mortality trend of hypertension in Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Shaanxi Province, Gansu Province, Ningxia 
Hui Autonomous Region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (6 provinces) in 
northwestern China, from 2013 to 2021, and evaluate the influence of 
hypertension on people's life expectancy. Methods: Based on national death 
surveillance data and demographic data in the 6 provinces from 2013 to 2021, the 
mortality rate, standardized mortality rate, life expectancy, cause eliminated 
life expectancy (CELE), potential gains in life expectancy (PGLEs) and life loss 
rate of hypertension were calculated. Software Joinpoint was used to analyze the 
mortality trends and calculate average annual percentage change (AAPC) and 
annual percentage change (APC) in hypertension deaths. Results: From 2013 to 
2021, the overall standardized mortality rate of hypertension in the 6 provinces 
showed a downward trend (AAPC=-1.82%, P=0.050). The mortality rate in rural area 
was always higher than that in urban area, and showed an increasing trend after 
2016 (APC=4.74%, P=0.003), and the mortality rate in men was always higher than 
that in women. The incidence trend of deaths of different types of hypertension 
were different, and the deaths caused by hypertensive heart disease accounted 
for the highest proportion (72.69%). In 2021, the life expectancy of the 
population in the 6 provinces increased by 1.01 years, the CELE increased by 
0.93 years, the PGLEs decreased by 0.08 years, and the life loss rate decreased 
by 0.11% compared with 2013. Conclusions: The overall standardized mortality 
rate of hypertension showed a decreasing trend in the 6 northwestern provinces 
from 2013 to 2021, but it showed an increasing trend in rural area after 2016. 
Prevention of hypertension should be further strengthened in rural area, men and 
elderly population.

With the global increase in the prevalence of allergic diseases and the rising 
life expectancy, it is anticipated that the number of elderly patients affected 
by allergies will also increase. While it was previously believed that allergies 
primarily affected children and adolescents and diminished with age, 
epidemiological studies indicate a growing prevalence of allergies in the 
elderly. Various allergic diseases have similar prevalence rates in the elderly 
as in the general population, and some, like drug allergies, are even more 
prevalent in this age group. Allergic diseases in the elderly often present with 
atypical symptoms, leading to challenges in differential diagnosis and 
treatment. This paper discusses immunosenescence and the distinct features of 
allergic diseases in older individuals. The goal is to raise awareness among 
healthcare providers about allergies in older adults, encourage preventive 
measures, and improve the quality of life for elderly patients with allergies. 
By managing allergies better, it can also help with the management of other 
chronic diseases in the elderly and contribute to better overall health for 
everyone.

With the decline in hepatitis B virus (HBV) incidence and the increase in the 
life expectancy of infected individuals, the population infected with HBV is 
experiencing rapid aging, leading to an escalating risk of co-morbid chronic 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This study summarizes research related to the 
comorbidity between HBV and NCDs, discussing the aging of the HBV-infected 
population, the mechanisms, prevalence, and management of this comorbidity. This 
study provides insights into potential directions for future research on the 
comorbidity between HBV and NCDs and aims to provide a basis for further 
research and the development of prevention and treatment strategies for the 
comorbidity of NCDs among HBV-infected individuals in China.

AIM: To explore the factors that affect the experiences of autistic patients in 
the hospital setting.
DESIGN: A scoping review.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search using the databases CINAHL, Medline 
and Google Scholar was undertaken in September 2021 and updated in January 2023. 
This review is based on the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley 
(International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8(1):19-32, 2005), which 
was further refined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews.
RESULTS: Autistic patients, as well as their families and healthcare staff, face 
several barriers that can impact their healthcare experiences within hospital 
settings. Of 211 articles screened, 30 were eligible and included. Through our 
review, we identified two main themes. The first theme, 'challenges to hospital 
experiences', includes four sub-themes: (1) communication, (2) a mismatch 
between the needs for autistic patients and the hospital environment, (3) 
challenges related to parents' experiences and (4) challenges related to 
hospital systems. The second theme, 'facilitators that improve hospital 
experiences', includes three sub-themes: (1) provision of care pathways, (2) 
partnership between parents and experts and (3) facilitators to improve hospital 
systems. By understanding these themes, we can work to address the barriers that 
autistic patients and their families face, while leveraging the facilitators to 
improve their hospital experiences.
CONCLUSION: It is critical to understand the experiences of autistic patients in 
the hospital setting because they present a substantial risk of hospital 
admission due to their associated acute to chronic health conditions. 
Additionally, nurses and other medical staff must understand the unique hospital 
experiences and challenges of autistic patients to improve care and facilitate 
better hospital experiences. This review further highlights the crucial need to 
adopt a collaborative and inclusive approach between autistic patients, their 
families and healthcare staff. To achieve this, co-design initiatives that 
incorporate the perspectives and lived experiences of the autistic community are 
necessary. By placing autistic voices at the forefront of these initiatives, it 
is hoped that changes are meaningful, relevant and can be sustained.
IMPACT: Understanding the unique hospital experiences and challenges of autistic 
patients can improve their quality of life and well-being by reducing stress and 
anxiety during hospitalization, leading to better health outcomes and 
potentially shorter hospital stays. It can also promote a more positive view of 
healthcare among autistic individuals, encouraging them to seek medical care 
when needed and have broader societal impacts such as reducing healthcare costs 
and improving the overall health and well-being of the population. Autistic 
patients present a substantial risk of hospital admission due to their 
associated acute to chronic conditions. Nurses and other medical staff must 
understand the unique hospital experiences and challenges of autistic patients 
to improve care and facilitate better hospital experiences.

cohort.

BACKGROUND: Recent data indicate a decline in overall longevity in the United 
States. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in midlife mortality 
rates had been reported. Life expectancy disparities have persisted in the 
United States for racial and ethnic groups and for individuals living at low 
socioeconomic status. These continued trends in mortality indicate the 
importance of examining biomarkers of mortality at midlife in at-risk 
populations. Circulating levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers reflect 
systemic chronic inflammation, which is a well-known driver of many age-related 
diseases.
METHODS: In this study, we examined the relationship of nine different 
inflammatory proteins with mortality in a middle-aged socioeconomically diverse 
cohort of African-American and White men and women (n = 1122; mean age = 47.8 
years).
RESULTS: We found significant differences in inflammatory-related protein serum 
levels between African-American and White middle-aged adults. E-selectin and 
fibrinogen were significantly higher in African-American adults. IFN-γ, TNF-α 
trimer, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), soluble receptor for 
advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) and P-selectin were significantly higher 
in White participants compared to African-American participants. Higher levels 
of E-selectin, MCP-1 and P-selectin were associated with a higher mortality 
risk. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between sex and IL-6 with 
mortality. IL-6 levels were associated with an increased risk of mortality, an 
association that was significantly greater in women than men. In addition, White 
participants with high levels of sRAGE had significantly higher survival 
probability than White participants with low levels of sRAGE, while 
African-American participants had similar survival probabilities across sRAGE 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that circulating inflammatory markers can be 
utilized as indicators of midlife mortality risk in a socioeconomically diverse 
cohort of African-American and White individuals.

BACKGROUND: Australia provides a valuable international case study of life 
expectancy during the pandemic. In contrast to many other countries, it 
experienced relatively stringent restrictions and low COVID-19 mortality during 
2020-21, followed by relaxation of these restrictions when high vaccination 
rates were achieved. This study measures Australia's life expectancy trends and 
the contributions of age group and causes of death, during the pandemic.
METHODS: Trends in life expectancy at birth in Australia and its states and 
territories were measured from 2020 to 2022. The contributions of age group and 
cause of death to these trends were measured using decomposition methods. Life 
expectancy was compared with other high-income countries.
RESULTS: Australia's life expectancy fell by more than half a year in 2022, 
following a sharp increase in 2020 and moderate decline in 2021. For the 3 years 
2020 to 2022, life expectancy was 0.13 years (95% confidence interval 0.07-0.19) 
higher for males and 0.09 years (0.03-0.14) higher for females versus 2017-19. 
Australia's life expectancy increase in 2020 was larger than that in the vast 
majority of other high-income countries, but its decline in 2022 was greater 
than in other countries whose life expectancy rose in the first year of the 
pandemic. The small negative contribution of COVID-19 deaths to life expectancy 
in Australia was more than offset by lower non-communicable disease mortality. 
There were only small differences in life expectancy change between the states 
with the most stringent restrictions (Victoria and New South Wales) and the rest 
of Australia.
CONCLUSIONS: Australia's life expectancy trends during 2020-22 were relatively 
favourable compared with other high-income countries, with the exception of its 
sharp decline in 2022 once restrictions were loosened.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has improved the life expectancy of 
patients living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As these patients age, 
they are at increased risk for developing non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
defining malignancies (NADMs) such as colon cancers.
AIM: To determine which factors are associated with the development of 
precancerous polyps on screening colonoscopy in patients with HIV and to 
investigate whether HIV disease status, measured by viral load and CD4 count, 
might influence precancerous polyp development.
METHODS: A retrospective review of records at two urban academic medical centers 
was performed for HIV patients who had a screening colonoscopy between 
2005-2015. Patients with a history of colorectal cancer or polyps, poor bowel 
preparation, or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. Demographic data such 
as sex, age, race, and body mass index (BMI) as well as information regarding 
the HIV disease status such as CD4 count, viral load, and medication regimen 
were collected. Well-controlled patients were defined as those that had viral 
load < 50 copies, and poorly-controlled patients were those with viral load ≥ 
50. Patients were also stratified based on their CD4 count, comparing those with 
a low CD4 count to those with a high CD4 count. Using colonoscopy reports in the 
medical record, the size, histology, and number of polyps were recorded for each 
patient. Precancerous polyps included adenomas and proximal serrated polyps. 
Data was analyzed using Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression through SAS 
3.8 software.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seven patients met our inclusion criteria. The mean age 
was 56.13 years, and 58% were males. There were no significant differences in 
terms of age, race or ethnicity, insurance, and smoking status between patients 
with CD4 counts above or below 500. BMI was lower in patients with CD4 count < 
500 as compared to those with count > 500 (P = 0.0276). In patients with CD4 > 
500, 53.85% of patients were female, and 70.87% of patients with CD4 < 500 were 
male (P = 0.0004). Only 1.92% of patients with CD4 ≥ 500 had precancerous polyps 
vs 10.68% of patients with CD4 < 500 (P = 0.0102). When controlled for sex, BMI, 
and ART use, patients with CD4 < 500 were 9.01 times more likely to have 
precancerous polyps [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.69-47.97; P = 0.0100]. 
Patients taking non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were also found 
to be 10.23 times more likely to have precancerous polyps (95%CI: 1.08-97.15; P 
= 0.0428). There was not a significant difference noted in precancerous polyps 
between those that had viral loads greater or less than 50 copies.
CONCLUSION: Patients with low CD4 counts were more likely to have precancerous 
polyps on their screening colonoscopy although the etiology for this association 
is unclear. We also found an increased risk of precancerous polyps in patients 
taking non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which is contradictory 
to prior literature showing ART has decreased the risk of development of NADMs. 
However, there have not been studies looking at colorectal cancer and ART by 
drug class, to our knowledge. Further prospective studies are needed to 
determine the effect of HIV control and therapies on polyp development.

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of six GLP-1RAs for treatment of Chinese 
type 2 diabetes mellitus patients that inadequately controlled on metformin: a 
micro-simulation model.

Business, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically estimate and compare the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) 
approved in China and to quantify the relationship between the burden of 
diabetic comorbidities and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or body mass index 
(BMI).
METHODS: To estimate the costs (US dollars, USD) and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) for six GLP-1RAs (exenatide, loxenatide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide, 
semaglutide, and liraglutide) combined with metformin in the treatment of 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) which is inadequately controlled 
on metformin from the Chinese healthcare system perspective, a discrete event 
microsimulation cost-effectiveness model based on the Chinese Hong Kong 
Integrated Modeling and Evaluation (CHIME) simulation model was developed. A 
cohort of 30,000 Chinese patients was established, and one-way sensitivity 
analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) with 50,000 iterations 
were conducted considering parameter uncertainty. Scenario analysis was 
conducted considering the impacts of research time limits. A network 
meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effects of six GLP-1RAs on HbA1c, 
BMI, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. The incremental net 
monetary benefit (INMB) between therapies was used to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness. China's per capita GDP in 2021 was used as the 
willingness-to-pay threshold. A generalized linear model was used to quantify 
the relationship between the burden of diabetic comorbidities and HbA1c or BMI.
RESULTS: During a lifetime, the cost for a patient ranged from USD 42,092 with 
loxenatide to USD 47,026 with liraglutide, while the QALY gained ranged from 
12.50 with dulaglutide to 12.65 with loxenatide. Compared to exenatide, the INMB 
of each drug from highest to lowest were: loxenatide (USD 1,124), dulaglutide 
(USD -1,418), lixisenatide (USD -1,713), semaglutide (USD -4,298), and 
liraglutide (USD -4,672). Loxenatide was better than the other GLP-1RAs in the 
base-case analysis. Sensitivity and scenario analysis results were consistent 
with the base-case analysis. Overall, the price of GLP-1RAs most affected the 
results. Medications with effective control of HbA1c or BMI were associated with 
a significantly smaller disease burden (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Loxenatide combined with metformin was identified as the most 
economical choice, while the long-term health benefits of patients taking the 
six GLP-1RAs are approximate.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common chronic articular disease worldwide. It is 
also the most common form of OA and is characterized by high morbidity and 
disability rates. With the gradual increase in life expectancy and ageing 
population, KOA not only affects the quality of life of patients, but also poses 
a burden on global public health. OA is a disease of unknown etiology and 
complex pathogenesis. It commonly affects joints subjected to greater loads and 
higher levels of activity. The knee joint, which is the most complex joint of 
the human body and bears the greatest load among all joints, is therefore most 
susceptible to development of OA. KOA lesions may involve articular cartilage, 
synovium, joint capsule and periarticular muscles, causing irreversible 
articular damage. Factors such as mechanical overload, inflammation, metabolism, 
hormonal changes and ageing serve key roles in the acceleration of KOA 
progression. The clinical diagnosis of KOA is primarily based on combined 
analysis of symptoms, signs, imaging and laboratory examination results. At 
present, there is no cure for KOA and the currently available therapies 
primarily focus on symptomatic treatment and delay of disease progression. Knee 
replacement surgery is typically performed in patients with advanced disease. 
The current study presents a review of epidemiological characteristics, risk 
factors, histopathological manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment 
modalities and progress in KOA research.

Insulin has been utilized in the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) for 100 
years. While there is still no cure for T1D, insulin administration has 
undergone a remarkable evolution which has contributed to improvements in 
quality of life and life expectancy in individuals with T1D. The advent of 
faster-acting and longer-acting insulins allowed for the implementation of 
insulin regimens more closely resembling normal insulin physiology. These 
improvements afforded better glycemic control, which is crucial for limiting 
microvascular complications and improving T1D outcomes. Suspension of insulin 
delivery in response to actual and forecasted hypoglycemia has improved quality 
of life and mitigated hypoglycemia without compromising glycemic control. 
Advances in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pumps, efforts to 
model glucose and insulin kinetics, and the application of control theory to T1D 
have made the automation of insulin delivery a reality. This review will 
summarize the past, present, and future of insulin administration in T1D.

In1998, the Boston Birth Cohort (BBC) was initiated at Boston Medical Center 
(BMC) in response to persistently high rates of preterm birth (PTB, defined as 
birth before 37 weeks of gestation) in the US population and the longstanding 
profound PTB disparity among Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). The 
BBC encompasses two linked study protocols: The PTB Study serves as the baseline 
recruitment in the BBC. It aims to address fundamental questions about the 
causes and consequences of PTB. The study oversamples preterm babies using a 
case/control study design, in which cases are defined as mothers who deliver a 
preterm and/or low birthweight baby (<2500 grams regardless of gestational age). 
Controls are enrolled at a 2:1 control/case ratio and matched by maternal age 
(±5 years), self-reported race and ethnicity, and date of delivery (± 7 days for 
case delivery). From inception, it was designed as a comprehensive 
gene-environmental study of PTB. As a natural extension, the Children's Health 
Study, under a separate but linked Institutional Review Board protocol, is a 
longitudinal follow-up study of the participants who were recruited at birth in 
the PTB Study and who continue pediatric care at BMC. This linked model allows 
for investigation of early life origins of pediatric and chronic disease in a 
prospective cohort design. The BBC is one of the largest and longest National 
Institutes of Health-funded prospective birth cohort studies in the United 
States, consisting of 8733 mother-child dyads enrolled in the PTB Study at 
birth, and of those, 3592 children have been enrolled in the Children's Health 
Study, with a median follow-up of 14.5 years. The BBC mirrors the urban, 
underresourced, and underrepresented BIPOC population served by BMC. A high 
proportion of BBC children were born prematurely and had chronic health 
conditions (e.g., asthma, obesity, and elevated blood pressure) in childhood. 
The BBC's long-term goal has been to build a large, comprehensive database 
(epidemiological, clinical, and multiomics) and biospecimen repository to 
elucidate early life origins of pediatric and chronic diseases and identify 
modifiable upstream factors (e.g., psychosocial, environmental, and nutritional) 
to improve health across the life course for BIPOC mothers and children.

INTRODUCTION: Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive 
neurodegenerative disorder that causes gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and 
impaired vibratory sense, with cardiomyopathy being the predominant cause of 
death. There is no approved therapy, which results in the use of symptomatic 
treatments and the chronic support of physiotherapy. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is 
a fumaric acid ester used for the treatment of psoriasis and Multiple Sclerosis 
(MS). It induces Nrf2 in vitro and in vivo, and it increases frataxin in FRDA 
patient lymphoblasts, in mouse models, and in MS treated patients.
METHODS: The aim of our study is to investigate if DMF can increase the 
expression of the FXN gene and frataxin protein and ameliorate in-vivo 
detectable measures of mitochondrial dysfunction in FRDA. The study is composed 
of a screening visit and two sequential 12-week phases: a core phase and an 
extension phase. During the first phase (core), patients will be randomly 
assigned to either the DMF or a placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. During the first 
week, patients will receive a total daily dose of 240 mg of DMF or placebo; from 
the second week of treatment, the dose will be increased to two 120 mg tablets 
BID for a total daily dose of 480 mg. During the second phase (extension), all 
patients will be treated with DMF. EudraCT number 2021-006274-23.
ENDPOINTS: The primary endpoint will be a change in FXN gene expression level 
after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints will be frataxin protein level, 
cardiopulmonary exercise test outputs, echocardiographic measures, Nrf2 pathway 
and mitochondrial biogenesis gene expression, safety, clinical scales, and 
quality of life scales.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study aimed at exploring the ability of DMF, an 
already available treatment for MS and psoriasis, to correct the biological 
deficits of FRDA and potentially improve mitochondrial respiration in-vivo.
