Metarhizium anisopliae is a promising alternative to chemical pesticides against 
pine wilt disease caused by Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Herein, we investigated 
the efficacy of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) to prolong the shelf-life of 
the M. anisopliae conidia. The effects of various conditions on its stability 
were also examined. M. anisopliae-inoculated millet grains were treated in a MAP 
system with different packaging materials (polypropylene, PP; polyethylene 
terephthalate, PET; ethylene vinyl alcohol, EVOH), gas compositions (high CO2 
atmosphere, ≈ 90%; high O2 atmosphere, > 95%; high N2 atmosphere, > 95%; 30% 
CO2 + 70% N2; 50% CO2 + 50% N2; 70% CO2 + 30% N2), and storage temperatures (4 
and 25 °C). Results revealed EVOH film as the best for the preservation of gases 
at all concentrations for 28 days. MAP treatment in the high-barrier EVOH film 
under an atmosphere of 30% CO2 + 70% N2 achieved 80.5% viability of dried 
conidia (7.4% moisture content), with 44.2-64.9% viability recorded with the 
other treatments. Cold storage for technical concentrates formulation promoted 
extension of shelf-life of MAP-treated conidia. These results imply that MAP 
under optimized conditions could enhance the shelf-life of fungus-based 
biopesticides in fungus-colonized substrates formulations.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to 
compare implant-supported removable partial dentures (ISRPDs) with distal 
extension removable partial dentures (DERPDs) in terms of patient-reported 
outcome measures (PROMs: patients' quality of life and satisfaction) and to 
determine mechanical and biological complications associated with ISRPDs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search was performed on four databases to 
identify studies treating Kennedy class I or II edentulous patients and which 
compared ISRPDs with DERPDs in terms of PROMS and studies, which evaluated 
mechanical and biological complications associated ISRPDs. Two authors 
independently extracted data on quality of life, patient satisfaction, and 
biomechanical complications from these studies. The risk of bias was assessed 
for each study, and for PROMs, the authors performed a meta-analysis by using a 
random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirteen articles were included based on the selection criteria. The 
difference in mean scores for quality of life (30.5 ± 1.8; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 24.9-36.1) and patient satisfaction (-20.8 ± 0.2; 95% CI, -23.7 
to -17.8) between treatments with conventional and implant-supported removable 
dentures was statistically significant (p < .05). Implant-supported removable 
dentures improved patients' overall quality of life and satisfaction. Some 
mechanical and biological complications, such as clasp adjustment, abutment or 
implant loosening, marginal bone resorption, and peri-implant mucositis, were 
noted in ISRPDs during patient follow-up. Studies assessing PROMs were very 
heterogeneous (I2  = 65%, p = .85; I2  = 75%, p = .88).
CONCLUSIONS: ISRPDs significantly improved quality of life and patient 
satisfaction. Some mechanical and biological complications have been associated 
with ISRPDs treatment, requiring regular monitoring of patients to avoid the 
occurrence of these complications.

To investigate the effect of a structured exercise training program on pain, 
functional status, physical function and quality of life (QoL) in string and 
woodwind players with nonspecific cervical pain. This study had a prospective 
cohort design and conducted on 40 musicians (26 male, 14 female) aged between 18 
and 65 years with persistent nonspecific neck pain in the previous 3 months. 
Forty musicians were assigned to either violin (n = 20, median age; 26.5 year, 
height; 1.67 m, body mass; 65 kg, BMI; 23.04 kg/m2) or ney group (n = 20, median 
age; 27.5 year, height; 1.81 m, body mass; 75 kg, BMI; 23.35 kg/m2) and followed 
the same structured exercise program (3 days/per week for 8 weeks). The primary 
outcome was neck pain intensity and assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS). 
Secondary outcomes; cervical range of motion (ROM) was measured using a 
goniometer, the jaw-to-sternum and jaw-to-wall distances were used for the 
assessment of cervical mobility, neck, shoulder and back muscles strength were 
assessed with a hand-held dynamometer, the Northwick Park Neck Pain and Short 
Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaires were also used. Normality of data distribution 
was checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For evaluating the training 
effectiveness on outcome measures, Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon test were used 
compare pre-test and post-test values with/within groups, respectively. The 
primary outcome (pain intensity) was lowered %33 in both groups. However, the 
mean change was found similar (median mean changes; -2 for both groups) 
(p > 0.05). The secondary outcomes; cervical mobility, cervical flexion ROM, 
disability and muscle strength of the left middle trapezius, left hand grip, 
anterior and middle parts of the right deltoid, and cervical flexors also 
significantly improved in both groups (p < 0.05). Only the mean changes of right 
serratus anterior, middle trapezius and cervical flexor muscles were higher in 
violin group than ney group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in 
the cervical extension, right rotation, left rotation, right lateral flexion and 
left lateral flexion after the treatment in both groups (p > 0.05). There was no 
significant difference between the groups after the exercise program in terms of 
pain, mobility, range of motion and SF-36 subdomains (p > 0.05). Specific 
exercise program had similar positive effects on pain, cervical mobility, 
cervical fexion ROM and disability in string and woodwind players. Although 
several muscles showed similar improvements in strength, some muscle groups 
recovered differently. Physical needs specific to the instrument and performance 
should be taken into account when prescribing exercises to musicians having the 
same problem, but playing different instruments.

PURPOSE: Novel pharmaceutical treatments reducing cardiovascular events in 
dyslipidaemia patients must demonstrate clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness 
to promote long-term adoption by patients, physicians, and insurers.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of statin monotherapy compared to 
additive lipid-lowering therapies for primary and secondary cardiovascular 
prevention from the perspective of Germany's healthcare system.
METHODS: Transition probabilities and hazard ratios were derived from 
cardiovascular outcome trials for statin combinations with icosapent ethyl 
(REDUCE-IT), evolocumab (FOURIER), alirocumab (ODYSSEY), ezetimibe (IMPROVE-IT), 
and fibrate (ACCORD). Costs and utilities were retrieved from previous 
literature. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was simulated 
with a Markov cohort model. The main outcomes were the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: For primary prevention, the addition of icosapent ethyl to statin 
generated 0.81 QALY and €14,732 costs (ICER: 18,133), whereas fibrates yielded 
0.63 QALY and € - 10,516 costs (ICER: - 16,632). For secondary prevention, the 
addition of ezetimibe to statin provided 0.61 QALY at savings of € - 5,796 
(ICER: - 9,555) and icosapent ethyl yielded 0.99 QALY and €14,333 costs (ICER: 
14,485). PCSK9 inhibitors offered 0.55 and 0.87 QALY at costs of €62,722 and 
€87,002 for evolocumab (ICER: 114,639) and alirocumab (ICER: 100,532), 
respectively. A 95% probability of cost-effectiveness was surpassed at €20,000 
for icosapent ethyl (primary and secondary prevention), €119,000 for alirocumab, 
and €149,000 for evolocumab.
CONCLUSIONS: For primary cardiovascular prevention, a combination therapy of 
icosapent ethyl plus statin is a cost-effective use of resources compared to 
statin monotherapy. For secondary prevention, icosapent ethyl, ezetimibe, 
evolocumab, and alirocumab increase patient benefit at different economic costs.

Obesity is a chronic illness that affects children, adolescents, and adults 
globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 35% of 
adults and 17% of children are obese in the United States. Worldwide, there are 
650 million obese adults and 42 million obese children under the age of 5. The 
definition of obesity is a body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 
with further delineation into classes.  Obesity has a psychosocial impact and an 
increase in medical and economic complications. With increased adipose tissue 
deposition, there is an increase in comorbid conditions and medical 
complications. These comorbidities include Type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accidents, malignancies like colon, 
breast, and uterine cancers, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, major 
depressive disorder, and liver disease. A positive correlation is seen with 
increased complications and increased fat deposition. Weight loss decreases 
medical complications such as hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. From a 
socioeconomic standpoint, treating obesity and its associated complications 
results in the United States alone expending more than $200 billion per year, 
which equals more than 20% of US health expenditure overall. Costs also are 
associated with missed work and a decreased life expectancy. When considering 
approaches to weight loss, medical and behavioral modifications may be 
ineffective for a plethora of obese patients. Patients who undergo bariatric 
surgery have lower long-term mortality rates than matched controls who do not 
undergo bariatric procedures.  Metabolic or bariatric, derived from the Greek 
words "baros," meaning weight, and "iatrikos," meaning medical, surgery has 
increased worldwide. In 2018, approximately 394,431 bariatric procedures were 
performed according to the International Federation of Surgery of Obesity and 
Metabolic Diseases. When discussing bariatric procedures, it is prudent to 
discuss obesity classifications. Class 1 is defined as a BMI of 30 to <35. Class 
2 is defined as a BMI of 35 to <40. Class 3, which can be categorized as "severe 
obesity," is defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 40. The National 
Institute of Health Consensus Development Panel in 1991 outlined the indications 
for surgical management of class 3, severe obesity, which the American Bariatric 
Society later revised in 2004. Candidates for bariatric surgery include adults 
with a BMI greater than or equal to 40 kg/m^2 without comorbid conditions or 
adults with a BMI between 35 to 39.9 kg/m^2 with at least one serious 
comorbidity. These comorbidities include diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep 
apnea, hyperlipidemia, obstructive hypoventilation syndrome, hypertension, 
Pickwickian syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis, pseudotumor cerebri, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, asthma, 
venous stasis disease, as well as debilitating arthritis. If a patient has been 
disqualified from another surgery due to obesity, such as surgery for 
osteoarthritis or ventral hernia repair, this serves as the qualifying serious 
comorbidity for bariatric surgery consideration.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) resulting from 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) requires specific calculation methods and input 
data. The aims of this study were to (i) identify existing NCD burden of disease 
(BoD) activities in Europe; (ii) collate information on data sources for 
mortality and morbidity; and (iii) provide an overview of NCD-specific methods 
for calculating NCD DALYs.
METHODS: NCD BoD studies were systematically searched in international 
electronic literature databases and in grey literature. We included all BoD 
studies that used the DALY metric to quantify the health impact of one or more 
NCDs in countries belonging to the European Region.
RESULTS: A total of 163 BoD studies were retained: 96 (59%) were single-country 
or sub-national studies and 67 (41%) considered more than one country. Of the 
single-country studies, 29 (30%) consisted of secondary analyses using existing 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) results. Mortality data were mainly derived (49%) 
from vital statistics. Morbidity data were frequently (40%) drawn from routine 
administrative and survey datasets, including disease registries and hospital 
discharge databases. The majority (60%) of national BoD studies reported 
mortality corrections. Multimorbidity adjustments were performed in 18% of 
national BoD studies.
CONCLUSION: The number of national NCD BoD assessments across Europe increased 
over time, driven by an increase in BoD studies that consisted of secondary data 
analysis of GBD study findings. Ambiguity in reporting the use of NCD-specific 
BoD methods underlines the need for reporting guidelines of BoD studies to 
enhance the transparency of NCD BoD estimates across Europe.

Residual steroid estrogens (SEs) in soil may be absorbed by plants, and 
subsequently threaten human health via food chains. However, the environmental 
behavior of SEs in soil-plant systems remains unclear. In this study, a wheat 
pot experiment using rhizosphere bags was performed to investigate the uptake 
and dissipation of target SEs (17 beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1)) in 
different soils. The results indicated that soils with higher organic matter and 
silt and clay reduced the plant uptake of estrogens. Compared with E1, E2 was 
less accumulated in plants, which was mainly correlated with its higher 
hydrophobicity and shorter half-life. Estrogens tended to concentrate in the 
plant roots instead of translocating to the shoots. In addition, plant 
cultivation enhanced estrogen dissipation in the rhizosphere with an improvement 
of 10-21%. This improvement mainly resulted from stimulating the activities of 
estrogen-degrading enzymes, increasing the total bacterial populations, and 
promoting the development of estrogen degraders. Furthermore, this promotion 
effect will increase with plant growth. These findings will help us understand 
the characteristics of SEs taken up by plants and the role of the rhizosphere in 
SEs elimination, and provide theoretical insights into reducing the pollution 
risk of SEs in agricultural soils.

AIMS: This report from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas Project 
updates and expands upon the widely cited 2019 report in presenting 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics for the 57 ESC member countries.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Statistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available 
year, are presented. Data sources include the World Health Organization, the 
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC 
sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare 
delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and 
environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest, left-sided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of 
these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 
targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) 
Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and 
males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared 
with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries 
spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. 
(iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in 
middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and 
exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 
2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese 
with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of 
obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD 
falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence 
rates are ∼30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in 
disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in 
middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of 
calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, 
with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with 
middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across 
all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 
15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in 
males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than 
CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is 
associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries 
in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and 
cardiac surgical procedures.
CONCLUSION: Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, 
and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across 
ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report. It seems clear, 
however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are falling short and present 
evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are unlikely to be 
met across ESC member countries.

Communication in surgery: the therapy of hope.

Lake City, UT, USA.

Surgeons are frequently consulted for assistance in the palliative management of 
patients, and surgery is an essential tool in the armamentarium of comprehensive 
palliative care. Palliative surgical consults are some of the most challenging 
surgical consults, not only for technical reasons, but also because of the 
(usually) higher odds of morbidity or mortality, often in the setting of a 
limited life expectancy. Surgery is also often seen as the last possibility of 
hope, which can place a great emotional burden on the surgeon. Surgeons find 
themselves torn between concern about causing more harm than good, and not 
wanting to miss an opportunity to help. Although there is a growing body of 
literature around the outcomes for palliative surgery and patient selection, 
most palliative surgery decisions are still not evidence-based, but rather 
experienced-based. Because palliative surgical decision-making relies heavily on 
the surgeon's experience and risk (and/or regret) tolerance, surgeons often find 
themselves called upon to explain highly complex and nuanced concepts with 
existential outcomes to people who are desperate for hope. Even for the best 
communicators, achieving the goals of effective communication can be challenging 
in these situations, and in some instances, may seem unachievable. This article 
examines the communication challenges faced by surgeons in the palliative 
surgical setting and recommends specific strategies and approaches to help 
address those challenges and facilitate effective communication. Lastly, it 
considers the most necessary element of care for most patients and surgeons in 
the palliative setting: hope.

BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent subtype of 
leukemia in Western countries, causing a substantial health burden on patients 
and society. Comprehensive evaluation of the epidemiological characteristics of 
CLL is warranted, especially in the current context of global population aging. 
The main objective of this study is evaluating the disease burden of CLL at 
global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2019. As secondary 
objectives, we studied the influence of demographic factors and performed risk 
factor analysis. We hope this study could provide evidence for the evaluation of 
the effectiveness of previous prevention strategies and the formulation of 
future global health policies.
RESULTS: Based on data of CLL between 1990 to 2019 from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study 2019, we depicted the age, gender, and regional structure of 
the CLL burden population and described the impact of social development on the 
disease burden of CLL. The distribution and changing trends of attributable risk 
factors were also investigated. The global burden of CLL has increased 
dramatically. A high incidence has been achieved in males and elder people. 
Countries and territories with high social-demographic index (SDI) tended to 
have higher global burden than low-SDI region. Of risk factors, high body mass 
index and smoking were the major contributors for CLL-related mortality and 
disability adjusted life-years (DALYs).
CONCLUSION: In summary, the global CLL burden continues to rise over the past 
30 years. The relocation of medical resource should be considered on a global 
scale.

Urban drainage is a topic of increasing interest due to its key role for 
managing water-related disasters, which are being exacerbated by the effects of 
Climate Change and urbanization. Since traditional drainage systems struggle to 
deal with the combined action of these phenomena, Sustainable Drainage Systems 
(SuDS) are gaining attention as an alternative to help manage these high-water 
management demands. In this context, this research aimed at conducting a 
lifecycle sustainability assessment for comparing the economic, environmental 
and social performance of both drainage systems. The three dimensions of 
sustainable development were addressed with the support of the concepts of Net 
Present Value (NPV), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and a combination of the 
Leopold matrix and a semi structured interview, respectively. The results of 
applying this approach to the case study of the Rancho Bellavista housing 
development (Querétaro, Mexico) showed that SuDS outperformed traditional 
drainage systems in environmental and social terms; however, their high 
maintenance costs and shorter life expectancy hindered its economic feasibility. 
As such, future urban plans should focus on complementary designs whereby the 
strengths of both drainage alternatives are combined to boost their 
contributions to achieving sustainable development.

Evaluation of nutritionally enhanced biofortified dietary interventions that 
increase lifespan may uncover cost-effective and sustainable approaches for 
treatment of age-related morbidities and increasing healthy life expectancy. In 
this study, we report that anthocyanin rich, high yielding crossbred blue wheat 
prolongs lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster in different dietary contexts. In 
addition to functioning as an antioxidant rich intervention, the biofortified 
blue wheat also works through modulating expression of DR pathway genes 
including AMPK alpha, SREBP, PEPCK and Cry. Supplementation with blue- or 
purple-colored wheat provided better protection against paraquat-induced 
oxidative stress than control diet and increased survivability of flies in which 
superoxide dismutase 2 was knocked down conditionally in adults. Lastly, our 
findings indicate that supplementing biofortified blue wheat formulated diet 
prevented the decrease in lifespan and cardiac structural pathologies associated 
with intake of high fat diet. Overall, our findings indicate that plant-based 
diets formulated with biofortified cereal crops promote healthy ageing and delay 
progression of diseases that are exacerbated by accumulation of oxidative 
damage.

An extended MAIRCA method using intuitionistic fuzzy sets for coronavirus 
vaccine selection in the age of COVID-19.

Administrative Sciences, Afyon Kocatepe University, 03030 Afyonkarahisar, 
Turkey.

All over the world, the COVID-19 outbreak seriously affects life, whereas 
numerous people have infected and passed away. To control the spread of it and 
to protect people, appreciable vaccine development efforts continue with 
increasing momentum. Given that this pandemic will be in our lives for a long 
time, it is obvious that a reliable and useful framework is needed to choose 
among coronavirus vaccines. To this end, this paper proposes a new 
intuitionistic fuzzy extension of MAIRCA framework, named intuitionistic fuzzy 
MAIRCA (IF-MAIRCA) to assess coronavirus vaccines according to some evaluation 
criteria. Based on the group decision-making, the IF-MAIRCA framework both 
extracts the criteria weights and discovers the prioritization of the 
alternatives under uncertainty. In this work, as a case study, five coronavirus 
vaccines approved by the world's leading authorities are evaluated according to 
various criteria. The findings demonstrate that the most significant criteria 
considered in coronavirus vaccine selection are "duration of protection," 
"effectiveness of the vaccine," "success against the mutations," and 
"logistics," respectively, whereas the best coronavirus vaccine is AZD1222. 
Apart from this, the proposed model's robustness is verified with a three-phase 
sensitivity analysis.

BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D on muscle health is debated.
METHODS: An individual participant metanalysis of 4 randomized 
placebo-controlled trials, investigating short-term (3-9months) effects of 
vitamin D3 in moderate (2800 IU) to high (7000 IU) daily oral doses on muscle 
health and quality of life (QoL). Inclusion criteria were either obesity 
(n = 52), newly diagnosed primary hyperparathyroidism (n = 41), Graves' disease 
(n = 86), or secondary hyperparathyroidism (n = 81).
RESULTS: Overall (n = 260) as well as in a subgroup analysis including only 
vitamin D insufficient [25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L] individuals (n = 176), vitamin D 
supplementation did not affect measures of muscle health (isometric muscle 
strength, Timed Up and Go test, chair rising test, body composition, and 
balance) or QoL. However, a beneficial effect was present on QoL (physical 
component score) in vitamin D deficient [25(OH)D < 25 nmol/L] individuals 
(n = 34). Overall, relative changes in 25(OH)D inversely affected maximum muscle 
strength in a dose-response manner. Stratified into body mass index </> 30 
kg/m2, vitamin D supplementation had divergent effects on isometric muscle 
strength, with beneficial effects in obese individuals (n = 93) at knee flexion 
90° (P = 0.04), and adverse effects in nonobese individuals (n = 167) at 
handgrip (P = 0.02), knee extension 60° (P = 0.03) and knee flexion 60° 
(P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Overall, short-term treatment with moderate to high daily doses of 
vitamin D did not affect muscle health or QoL. A potential beneficial effect was 
present on muscle strength in severely obese individuals and on QoL in vitamin D 
deficient individuals. Subgroup analyses, however, suggested negative effects of 
large relative increases in p-25(OH)D.

Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Advance Care Planning: Assessing the Role of 
Subjective Life Expectancy.

Lou Y(1), Carr D(2).

Author information:

OBJECTIVES: Persistent race disparities in advance care planning (ACP) are 
troubling, given Black and Hispanic older adults' elevated risk of disease, some 
dementias, and receipt of care that may not align with their preferences. A 
potentially important yet underexplored explanation for these disparities is 
subjective life expectancy (SLE) or beliefs about one's future survival that may 
impel or impede ACP.
METHODS: Data are from the Health and Retirement Study (n = 8,912). We examined 
the extent to which perceived chances of living another 10 years are associated 
with 3 components of ACP (living will, durable power of attorney for health care 
[DPAHC], and informal discussions). We used multilevel logistic regression 
models to evaluate the extent to which SLE mediates the association between race 
and ACP, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and health 
characteristics.
RESULTS: Black and Hispanic older adults have significantly lower rates of ACP 
relative to Whites. These disparities persist even when SLE is controlled. 
Blacks report especially optimistic whereas Hispanics report pessimistic 
survival expectations, although these differences do not explain racial 
disparities in ACP. SLE has direct effects on ACP, such that persons who report 
an "uncertain" SLE are less likely to have a living will or a DPAHC, whereas 
those who perceive a 50% chance of survival have significantly greater odds of 
discussions, relative to those who perceive a 0% chance of survival.
DISCUSSION: Doctor-patient conversations about the likely course of one's 
illness may inform patients' knowledge of their SLE, which may motivate timely 
ACP.

BACKGROUND: Due to the longer life expectancy and consequently an increase in 
the elderly population, a higher incidence of gastric cancer is expected in this 
population in the coming decades.
AIM: To compare the results of laparoscopic GC surgical treatment between 
individuals aged<65 years (group I) and ≥ 65 years (group II), according to 
clinical, surgical, and histopathological characteristics.
METHODS: A observational retrospective study was performed by analyzing medical 
charts of patients with gastric cancer undergoing total or subtotal laparoscopic 
gastrectomy for curative purposes by a single oncologic surgery team.
RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included in each group. Regarding the ASA 
classification, 31% of the patients in group I was ASA 1, compared to 3.1% in 
group II. The mean number of concomitant medications in group II was 
statistically superior to group I (5±4.21 x 1.42±3.08, p<0.001). Subtotal 
gastrectomy was the most performed procedure in both groups (69.4% and 63.9% in 
groups I and II, respectively) due to the high prevalence of distal tumors in 
both groups, 54.4% group I and 52.9% group II. According to Lauren's 
classification, group I presented a predominance of diffuse tumors (50%) and 
group II the intestinal type (61.8%). There was no difference between the two 
groups regarding the number of resected lymph nodes and lymph node metastases 
and the days of hospitalization and mortality.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic gastrectomy showed to be a safe procedure, without a 
statistical difference in morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization time between 
both groups.

RACIONAL: Devido à maior expectativa de vida, e consequentemente aumento da 
população de idosos, é esperada uma maior incidência de câncer gástrico nesta 
população nas próximas décadas.
OBJETIVOS: Comparar os resultados do tratamento cirúrgico por via laparoscópica 
do câncer gástrico entre pacientes com idade <65 anos (grupo I) e ≥65 anos 
(grupo II), de acordo com características clínicas, cirúrgicas e 
histopatológicas.
MÉTODOS: Foi realizado um estudo retrospectivo, observacional baseado na análise 
de prontuários médicos de pacientes com câncer gástrico, submetidos à 
gastrectomia total ou subtotal laparoscópica com finalidade curativa, por uma 
única equipe de cirurgia oncológica.
RESULTADOS: Foram avaliados 36 pacientes em cada grupo. Em relação à 
classificação ASA, 62,1% dos pacientes do grupo I eram ASA 1 comparado a 3.1% no 
grupo II. O número médio de medicações concomitantes do grupo II foi superior ao 
grupo I (5±4,21 x 1.42±3,08, p<0.001). A gastrectomia subtotal foi o 
procedimento mais realizado nos dois grupos (69,4% e 63,9% nos grupos I e II 
respectivamente) devido a maior prevalência de tumores distais em ambos os 
grupos, 54.4% grupo I e 52.9% grupo II. De acordo com a classificação de Laurén, 
no grupo I houve predomínio de tumores difusos (50,0%) e no grupo II do tipo 
intestinal (61,8%). Não houve diferença entre os dois grupos em relação a 
quantidade de linfonodos ressecados e de linfonodos positivos para metástases, 
assim como o tempo de permanência no CTI, dias de hospitalização e mortalidade.
CONCLUSÃO: A gastrectomia por via laparoscópica é procedimento seguro, sem haver 
diferenças em morbidade, mortalidade e tempo de internação entre pacientes 
jovens e idosos.

Many biomarkers have been shown to be associated not only with chronological age 
but also with functional measures of biological age. In human populations, it is 
difficult to show whether variation in biological age is truly predictive of 
life expectancy, as such research would require longitudinal studies over many 
years, or even decades. We followed adult cohorts of 20 Drosophila Genetic 
Reference Panel (DGRP) strains chosen to represent the breadth of lifespan 
variation, obtain estimates of lifespan, baseline mortality, and rate of aging, 
and associate these parameters with age-specific functional traits including 
fecundity and climbing activity and with age-specific targeted metabolomic 
profiles. We show that activity levels and metabolome-wide profiles are strongly 
associated with age, that numerous individual metabolites show a strong 
association with lifespan, and that the metabolome provides a biological clock 
that predicts not only sample age but also future mortality rates and lifespan. 
This study with 20 genotypes and 87 metabolites, while relatively small in 
scope, establishes strong proof of principle for the fly as a powerful 
experimental model to test hypotheses about biomarkers and aging and provides 
further evidence for the potential value of metabolomic profiles as biomarkers 
of aging.
