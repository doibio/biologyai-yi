Long-lived mouse models and treatments that extend lifespan, such as Rapamycin, 
acarbose and 17α- -estradiol, lead to reduction in mTORC1 activity, declines in 
cap-dependent translation and increases in cap-independent translation. In 
addition, these treatments reduce the MEK-ERK-MNK (ERK1-2) signaling cascade, 
leading to reduction in eIF4E phosphorylation, which also regulates mRNA 
translation. Here, we report that Canagliflozin, a drug that extends lifespan 
only in male mice reduces mTORC1 and ERK1-2 signaling in male mice only. The 
data suggest reduction in mTORC1 and ERK pathways are common mechanisms shared 
by both genetic and pharmacological models of slowed aging in mice. Our data 
also reveal a significant sexual dimorphism in the ERK1-2 signaling pathway 
which might help to explain why some drugs can extend lifespan in males but have 
no effects in female mice.
