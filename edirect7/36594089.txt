The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a 
pro-inflammatory immune receptor potentiating acute lung injury (ALI). However, 
the mechanism of TREM-1-triggered inflammation response remains poorly 
understood. Here, we showed that TREM-1 blocking attenuated NOD-, LRR- and pyrin 
domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and glycolysis in 
LPS-induced ALI mice. Then, we observed that TREM-1 activation enhanced glucose 
consumption, induced glycolysis, and inhibited oxidative phosphorylation in 
macrophages. Specifically, inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose 
diminished NLRP3 inflammasome activation of macrophages triggered by TREM-1. 
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a critical transcriptional regulator of 
glycolysis. We further found that TREM-1 activation facilitated HIF-1α 
accumulation and translocation to the nucleus via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Inhibiting mTOR or 
HIF-1α also suppressed TREM-1-induced metabolic reprogramming and 
NLRP3/caspase-1 activation. Overall, the mTOR/HIF-1α/glycolysis pathway is a 
novel mechanism underlying TREM-1-governed NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 
Therapeutic targeting of the mTOR/HIF-1α/glycolysis pathway in TREM-1-activated 
macrophages could be beneficial for treating or preventing inflammatory 
diseases, such as ALI.
