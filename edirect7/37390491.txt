BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer, characterized by a high potential of tumor 
recurrence, has high lifelong monitoring and treatment costs. To date, tumor 
cells with intrinsic softness have been identified to function as cancer stem 
cells in several cancer types. Nonetheless, the existence of soft tumor cells in 
bladder tumors remains elusive. Thus, our study aimed to develop a micro-barrier 
microfluidic chip to efficiently isolate deformable tumor cells from distinct 
types of bladder cancer cells.
METHODS: The stiffness of bladder cancer cells was determined by atomic force 
microscopy (AFM). The modified microfluidic chip was utilized to separate soft 
cells, and the 3D Matrigel culture system was to maintain the softness of tumor 
cells. Expression patterns of integrin β8 (ITGB8), protein kinase B (AKT), and 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were determined by performing Western 
blotting. Double immunostaining was conducted to examine the interaction between 
F-actin and tripartite motif containing 59 (TRIM59). The stem-cell-like 
characteristics of soft cells were explored by colony formation assay and in 
vivo studies upon xenografted tumor models.
RESULTS: Using our newly designed microfluidic approach, we identified a small 
fraction of soft tumor cells in bladder cancer cells. More importantly, the 
existence of soft tumor cells was confirmed in clinical human bladder cancer 
specimens, in which the number of soft tumor cells was associated with tumor 
relapse. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the biomechanical stimuli arising 
from 3D Matrigel activated the F-actin/ITGB8/TRIM59/AKT/mTOR/glycolysis pathways 
to enhance the softness and tumorigenic capacity of tumor cells. Simultaneously, 
we detected a remarkable up-regulation in ITGB8, TRIM59, and phospho-AKT in 
clinical bladder recurrent tumors compared with their non-recurrent 
counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: The ITGB8/TRIM59/AKT/mTOR/glycolysis axis plays a crucial role on 
modulating tumor softness and stemness. Meanwhile, the soft tumor cells become 
more sensitive to chemotherapy after stiffening, that offers new insights for 
hampering tumor progression and recurrence.
