The geroscience hypothesis states that a therapy that prevents the underlying 
aging process should prevent multiple aging related diseases. The mTOR 
(mechanistic target of rapamycin)/insulin and NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide) pathways are two of the most validated aging pathways. Yet, it's 
largely unclear how they might talk to each other in aging. In genome-wide 
CRISPRa screening with a novel class of N-O-Methyl-propanamide-containing 
compounds we named BIOIO-1001, we identified lipid metabolism centering on SIRT3 
as a point of intersection of the mTOR/insulin and NAD+ pathways. In vivo 
testing indicated that BIOIO-1001 reduced high fat, high sugar diet-induced 
metabolic derangements, inflammation, and fibrosis, each being characteristic of 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). An unbiased screen of patient datasets 
suggested a potential link between the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic 
effects of BIOIO-1001 in NASH models to those in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS). Directed experiments subsequently determined that BIOIO-1001 was 
protective in both sporadic and familial ALS models. Both NASH and ALS have no 
treatments and suffer from a lack of convenient biomarkers to monitor 
therapeutic efficacy. A potential strength in considering BIOIO-1001 as a 
therapy is that the blood biomarker that it modulates, namely plasma 
triglycerides, can be conveniently used to screen patients for responders. More 
conceptually, to our knowledge BIOIO-1001 is a first therapy that fits the 
geroscience hypothesis by acting on multiple core aging pathways and that can 
alleviate multiple conditions after they have set in.
