Rapamycin (sirolimus) is an immunosuppressive drug approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). It is also a leading candidate for targeting aging. 
Rapamycin and its analogs (everolimus, temsirolimus, ridaforolimus) inhibit the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase by binding to FK506-binding proteins 
(FKBP) and have a similar chemical structure that only differs in the functional 
group present at carbon-40. Analogs of rapamycin were developed to improve its 
pharmacological properties, such as low oral bioavailability and a long 
half-life. The analogs of rapamycin are referred to as "rapalogs." Rapamycin is 
the parent compound and should therewith not be called a "rapalog."
