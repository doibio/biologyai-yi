Focal epilepsy accounts for 60% of all forms of epilepsy, but the pathogenic 
mechanism is not well understood. In this study, three novel mutations in NPRL3 
(nitrogen permease regulator-like 3), c.937_945del, c.1514dupC and 6,706-bp 
genomic DNA (gDNA) deletion, were identified in three families with focal 
epilepsy by linkage analysis, whole exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger 
sequencing. NPRL3 protein is a component of the GATOR1 complex, a major 
inhibitor of mTOR signaling. These mutations led to truncation of the NPRL3 
protein and hampered the binding between NPRL3 and DEPDC5, which is another 
component of the GATOR1 complex. Consequently, the mutant proteins enhanced mTOR 
signaling in cultured cells, possibly due to impaired inhibition of mTORC1 by 
GATOR1. Knockdown of nprl3 in Drosophila resulted in epilepsy-like behavior and 
abnormal synaptic development. Taken together, these findings expand the 
genotypic spectrum of NPRL3-associated focal epilepsy and provide further 
insight into how NPRL3 mutations lead to epilepsy.
