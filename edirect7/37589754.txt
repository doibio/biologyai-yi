Exposure to chronic psychological stress (CPS) is an intractable risk factor for 
inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Lysosomal cysteinyl cathepsins play an 
important role in human pathobiology. Given that cathepsin S (CTSS) is 
upregulated in the stressed vascular and adipose tissues, we investigated 
whether CTSS participates in chronic stress-induced skeletal muscle mass loss 
and dysfunction, with a special focus on muscle protein metabolic imbalance and 
apoptosis. Eight-week-old male wildtype (CTSS+/+) and CTSS-knockout (CTSS-/-) 
mice were randomly assigned to non-stress and variable-stress groups. CTSS+/+ 
stressed mice showed significant losses of muscle mass, dysfunction, and fiber 
area, plus significant mitochondrial damage. In this setting, stressed muscle in 
CTSS+/+ mice presented harmful alterations in the levels of insulin receptor 
substrate 2 protein content (IRS-2), phospho-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, 
phospho-protein kinase B, and phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin, forkhead 
box-1, muscle RING-finger protein-1 protein, mitochondrial biogenesis-related 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-α, and 
apoptosis-related B-cell lymphoma 2 and cleaved caspase-3; these alterations 
were prevented by CTSS deletion. Pharmacological CTSS inhibition mimics its 
genetic deficiency-mediated muscle benefits. In C2C12 cells, CTSS silencing 
prevented stressed serum- and oxidative stress-induced IRS-2 protein reduction, 
loss of the myotube myosin heavy chain content, and apoptosis accompanied by a 
rectification of investigated molecular harmful changes; these changes were 
accelerated by CTSS overexpression. These findings demonstrated that CTSS plays 
a role in IRS-2-related protein anabolism and catabolism and cell apoptosis in 
stress-induced muscle wasting, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for the 
control of chronic stress-related muscle disease in mice under our experimental 
conditions by regulating CTSS activity.
