Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is an early developing complication of 
diabetes mellitus associated with nerve dysfunction. Artesunate (ART), a natural 
compound extracted from the herb Artemisia annua L., was reported to benefit 
neural injury. However, whether ART has a role in preventing DPN is still 
unknown. In this study, a rat model of DPN with a high fat diet feeding and 
streptozotocin (STZ) injection was established. The findings indicated that ART 
treatment significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia-induced hot plate reaction 
latency (HPRL) decline, cold sensitivity and mechanical allodynia, and nerve 
injury by inhibiting sciatic nerve apoptosis. Further, ART restored high glucose 
(HG)-induced elevated apoptosis and deficient survival in rat neuronal Schwann 
cells, RSC96 cells. We demonstrated that ART promoted protein kinase B (AKT) 
phosphorylation as well as its downstream factor mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) in vivo and in vitro. Of note, the protective effects of ART in RSC96 
cells under HG condition could be counteracted by LY294002, a 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. Taken together, ART mitigated 
hyperglycemia-induced nerve injury by suppressing apoptosis and promoting the 
viability of Schwann cells via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
