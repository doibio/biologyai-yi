PURPOSE: The eukaryotic cell plasma membrane contains several asymmetrically 
distributed phospholipids, which is maintained by the P4-ATPase flippase 
complex. Herein, we demonstrated the biological effects and mechanisms of 
asymmetrical loss in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
METHODS: An Atp8a1 knockout mouse model was employed, from which the HSC 
(long-term HSCs and short-term HSCs) population was analyzed to assess their 
abundance and function. Additionally, competitive bone marrow transplantation 
and 5-FU stress assays were performed. RNA sequencing was performed on 
Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells, and DNA damage was assayed using 
immunofluorescence staining and comet electrophoresis. The protein abundance for 
members of key signaling pathways was confirmed using western blotting.
RESULTS: Atp8a1 deletion resulted in slight hyperleukocytosis, associated with 
the high proliferation of HSCs and BCR/ABL1 transformed leukemia stem cells 
(LSCs). Atp8a1 deletion increased the repopulation capability of HSCs with a 
competitive advantage in reconstitution assay. HSCs without Atp8a1 were more 
sensitive to 5-FU-induced apoptosis. Moreover, Atp8a1 deletion prevented HSC DNA 
damage and facilitated DNA repair processes. Genes involved in PI3K-AKT-mTORC1, 
DNA repair, and AP-1 complex signaling were enriched and elevated in HSCs with 
Atp8a1 deletion. Furthermore, Atp8a1 deletion caused decreased PTEN protein 
levels, resulting in the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 signaling, further 
increasing the activity of JNK/AP-1 signaling and YAP1 phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: We identified the role of Atp8a1 on hematopoiesis and HSCs. Atp8a1 
deletion resulted in the loss of phosphatidylserine asymmetry and intracellular 
signal transduction chaos.
