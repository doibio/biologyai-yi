Average and maximal lifespan can be increased in mice, in one or both sexes, by 
four drugs: rapamycin, acarbose, 17a-estradiol, and canagliflozin. We show here 
that these four drugs, as well as a calorie-restricted diet, can induce a common 
set of changes in fat, macrophages, plasma, muscle, and brain when evaluated in 
young adults at 12 months of age. These shared traits include an increase in 
uncoupling protein UCP1 in brown fat and in subcutaneous and intra-abdominal 
white fat, a decline in proinflammatory M1 macrophages and corresponding 
increase in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, an increase in muscle fibronectin 
type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5) and its cleavage product irisin, and higher 
levels of doublecortin (DCX) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in 
brain. Each of these proteins is thought to play a role in one or more 
age-related diseases, including metabolic, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative 
diseases. We have previously shown that the same suite of changes is seen in 
each of four varieties of slow-aging single-gene mutant mice. We propose that 
these changes may be a part of a shared common pathway that is seen in 
slow-aging mice whether the delayed aging is due to a mutation, a low-calorie 
diet, or a drug.
