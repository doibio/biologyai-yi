OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether meranzin hydrate (MH) can alleviate 
depression-like behavior and hypomotility similar to Chaihu Shugan Powder (CSP), 
and further explore the potential common mechanisms.
METHODS: Totally 120 Spraque-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5-8 groups 
including sham, vehicle, fluoxetine (20 mg/kg), mosapride (10 mg/kg), CSP (30 
g/kg), MH (9.18 mg/kg), [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 (Dlys, 0.5 mg/kg), and MH+Dlys groups by 
a random number table, 8 rats in each group. And 32 mice were randomly divided 
into wild-type, MH (18 mg/kg), growth hormone secretagogue receptor-knockout 
(GHSR-KO), and GHSR+MH groups, 8 mice in each group. The forced swimming test 
(FST), open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), gastric emptying (GE) 
test, and intestinal transit (IT) test were used to assess antidepressant and 
prokinetic (AP) effects after drug single administration for 30 min with 
absorbable identification in rats and mice, respectively. The protein expression 
levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated mammalian 
target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) in the hippocampus of rats were evaluated by 
Western blot. The differences in functional brain changes were determined via 
7.0 T functional magnetic resonance imaging-blood oxygen level-dependent 
(fMRI-BOLD).
RESULTS: MH treatment improved depression-like behavior (FST, OFT) and 
hypomotility (GE, IT) in the acute forced swimming (FS) rats (all P<0.05), and 
the effects are similar to the parent formula CSP. The ghrelin antagonist 
[D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 inhibited the effect of MH on FST and GE (P<0.05). Similarly, MH 
treatment also alleviated depression-like behavior (FST, TST) in the wild-type 
mice, however, no effects were found in the GHSR KO mice. Additionally, 
administration of MH significantly stimulated BDNF and p-mTOR protein 
expressions in the hippocampus (both P<0.01), which were also prevented by 
[D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 (P<0.01). Besides, 3 main BOLD foci following acute FS rats 
implicated activity in hippocampus-thalamus-basal ganglia (HTB) circuits. The 
[D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 synchronously inhibited BOLD HTB foci. As expected, prokinetic 
mosapride only had effects on the thalamus and basal ganglia, but not on the 
hippocampus. Within the HTB, the hippocampus is implicated in depression and FD.
CONCLUSIONS: MH accounts for part of AP effects of parent formula CSP in acute 
FS rats, mainly via ghrelin-related shared regulation coupled to BOLD signals in 
brain areas. This novel functionally connection of HTB following acute stress, 
treatment, and regulation highlights anti-depression unified theory.
