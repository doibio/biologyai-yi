BACKGROUND: Oncostatin M produced by osteal macrophages, a cytokine that belongs 
to the interleukin-6 family, is implicated in bone fracture healing. Macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) secreted from osteoblasts plays an important 
role in osteoclastogenesis. We have previously reported that tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), a potent bone resorptive agent, stimulates the activation of 
p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, Akt, and p70 S6 kinase in 
osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells, and induces the synthesis of M-CSF at least in 
part via Akt.
OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated whether oncostatin M affects 
the TNF-α-induced M-CSF synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells and the underlying 
mechanisms.
METHODS: Clonal osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with oncostatin M or 
rapamycin and then stimulated with TNF-α. M-CSF release was assessed by ELISA. 
M-CSF mRNA expression level was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Phosphorylation of 
Akt, p44/p42 MAP kinase, and p70 S6 kinase was detected by Western blot 
analysis.
RESULTS: Oncostatin M dose-dependently reduced the TNF-α-stimulated M-CSF 
release. The expression of M-CSF mRNA induced by TNF-α was significantly 
suppressed by oncostatin M. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR/p70 S6 kinase, had 
little effect on the M-CSF release by TNF-α. Oncostatin M significantly reduced 
the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of Akt and p44/p42 MAP kinase. However, the 
p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation by TNF-α was not affected by oncostatin M.
CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that oncostatin M attenuates 
TNF-α-stimulated synthesis of M-CSF in osteoblasts, and the inhibitory effect is 
exerted at a point upstream of Akt and p44/p42 MAP kinase but not p70 S6 kinase.
