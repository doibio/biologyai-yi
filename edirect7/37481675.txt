Aging manifests as progressive deteriorations in homeostasis, requiring 
systems-level perspectives to investigate the gradual molecular dysregulation of 
underlying biological processes. Here, we report systemic changes in the 
molecular regulation of biological processes under multiple lifespan-extending 
interventions. Differential Rank Conservation (DIRAC) analyses of mouse liver 
proteomics and transcriptomics data show that mechanistically distinct 
lifespan-extending interventions (acarbose, 17α-estradiol, rapamycin, and 
calorie restriction) generally tighten the regulation of biological modules. 
These tightening patterns are similar across the interventions, particularly in 
processes such as fatty acid oxidation, immune response, and stress response. 
Differences in DIRAC patterns between proteins and transcripts highlight 
specific modules which may be tightened via augmented cap-independent 
translation. Moreover, the systemic shifts in fatty acid metabolism are 
supported through integrated analysis of liver transcriptomics data with a mouse 
genome-scale metabolic model. Our findings highlight the power of systems-level 
approaches for identifying and characterizing the biological processes involved 
in aging and longevity.
