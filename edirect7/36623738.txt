Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and irreversible lung disease 
with limited therapeutic options. Aspirin can alleviate liver, kidney, and 
cardiac fibrosis. However, its role in lung fibrosis is unclear. This study aims 
to investigate the effects of aspirin on lung fibroblast differentiation and 
pulmonary fibrosis. TGF-β1-induced human embryonic lung fibroblasts, IPF lung 
fibroblasts, and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis mouse model were used in this 
study. The results showed that aspirin significantly decreased the expression of 
Collagen 1A1, Fibronectin, Alpha-smooth muscle actin, and equestosome1, and 
increased the ratio of light chain 3 beta II/I and the number of autophagosome 
in vivo and in vitro; reduced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Aspirin also 
decreased the ratios of phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase 
(p-PI3K)/PI3K, protein kinase B (p-AKT)/AKT, and mechanistic target of rapamycin 
(p-mTOR)/mTOR in vitro. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, bafilomycin-A1, and 
AKT activator SC-79 abrogated the effects of aspirin. These findings indicate 
that aspirin ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis through a PI3K/AKT/mTOR-dependent 
autophagy pathway.
