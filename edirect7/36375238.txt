BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are strongly associated with high 
tumourigenicity, chemotherapy or radiotherapy resistance, and metastasis and 
recurrence, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, targeting CSCs 
may be a promising approach. Recently, discovery and research on phytochemicals 
that effectively target colorectal CSCs have been gaining popularity because of 
their broad safety profile and multi-target and multi-pathway modes of action.
PURPOSE: This review aimed to elucidate and summarise the effects and mechanisms 
of phytochemicals with potential anti-CSC agents that could contribute to the 
better management of CRC.
METHODS: We reviewed PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Ovid, ScienceDirect and 
China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases from the original publication 
date to March 2022 to review the mechanisms by which phytochemicals inhibit CRC 
progression by targeting CSCs and their key signalling pathways. Phytochemicals 
were classified and summarised based on the mechanisms of action.
RESULTS: We observed that phytochemicals could affect the biological properties 
of colorectal CSCs. Phytochemicals significantly inhibit self-renewal, 
migration, invasion, colony formation, and chemoresistance and induce apoptosis 
and differentiation of CSCs by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (e.g., 
diallyl trisulfide and genistein), the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein 
kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway (e.g., caffeic acid and 
piperlongumine), the neurogenic locus notch homolog protein pathway (e.g., 
honokiol, quercetin, and α-mangostin), the Janus kinase-signal transducer and 
activator of transcription pathway (e.g., curcumin, morin, and ursolic acid), 
and other key signalling pathways. It is worth noting that several 
phytochemicals, such as resveratrol, silibinin, evodiamine, and thymoquinone, 
highlight multi-target and multi-pathway effects in restraining the malignant 
biological behaviour of CSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrates the potential of targeted therapies for 
colorectal CSCs using phytochemicals. Phytochemicals could serve as novel 
therapeutic agents for CRC and aid in drug development.
