INTRODUCTION: An echocardiographic calcium score (ECS) predicts cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) in the general population. Its utility in peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
patients is unknown.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 125 patients on PD. The ECS (range 
0-8) was compared between subjects with CVD and those without.
RESULTS: Among the subjects, 54 had CVD and 71 did not. Subjects with CVD were 
older (69 years vs. 56 years, P < 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of diabetes 
mellitus (DM) (81.5% vs. 45.1%, P < 0.001). They had lower diastolic blood 
pressure (72 mmHg vs. 81 mmHg, P < 0.001), lower phosphate (1.6 mmol/L vs. 1.9 
mmol/L, P = 0.002), albumin (30 g/L vs. 32 g/L, P = 0.001), parathyroid hormone 
(34.4 pmol/L vs. 55.8 pmol/L, P = 0.002), total cholesterol (4.5 vs. 4.9, P = 
0.047), LDL cholesterol (2.4 mmol/L vs. 2.8 mmol/L, P = 0.019) and HDL 
cholesterol (0.8 mmol/L vs. 1.1 mmol/L, P = 0.002). The ECS was found to be 
higher in subjects with CVD than in those without (2 vs. 1, P = 0.001). On 
multivariate analysis, only DM and age were independently associated with CVD.
CONCLUSION: The ECS was significantly higher in PD patients with CVD than in 
those without, reflecting a higher vascular calcification burden in the former. 
It is a potentially useful tool to quantify vascular calcification in PD 
patients.
