OBJECTIVES: Malnutrition characterized by the involuntary loss of body weight 
and skeletal muscle can be the result of both aging and malignancy. As a result, 
geriatric patients could face an increased nutritional risk. This study aimed to 
investigate the nutritional and functional status of geriatric patients and 
their association with postoperative complications.
METHODS: Patients who underwent abdominal surgery for digestive cancer in our 
center between January 2020 and August 2021 were included in the study. Computed 
tomography scans were collected to evaluate muscle mass and density. Changes in 
body weight, muscle strength, physical performances, nutritional risk, and 
status were evaluated upon admission. Postoperative outcomes collected included 
postoperative length of stay, complications, and 30-d readmission.
RESULTS: A total of 1513 patients were included for the analysis. Of these, 
72.8% were at risk for malnutrition (70.3% in the non-geriatric group and 75.4% 
in the geriatric group; P = 0.031), and 28.9% had malnutrition according to the 
Subjective Global Assessment (26.0% in the non-geriatric group and 31.8% in the 
geriatric group; P = 0.016). Compared with younger patients, geriatric patients 
have decreased muscle mass (skeletal muscle index, 44.8 versus 47.4; P < 0.001) 
and skeletal muscle density. Significant weight loss and loss of skeletal muscle 
occurred concurrently in 18.8% of the patients and were more frequent in the 
geriatric group (22.3% versus 14.7%; P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, an 
age of 65 y or older (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.07-1.86; P = 0.014), a serum albumin level ≤4.11 g/dL (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 
1.03-1.77; P = 0.03), skeletal muscle loss (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.28-2.24; P < 
0.001), declined functional status (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.14-1.98; P = 0.004), 
systematic inflammation (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.09-2.8; P = 0.026), and significant 
weight loss (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.06-2.85; P = 0.017) were independent predictors 
of overall postoperative complications. Although there was a trend of 
interactions between advanced age, skeletal muscle loss, and significant weight 
loss, multivariate analysis showed none of the interactions were significantly 
predictive of overall postoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric patients are at greater risk for malnutrition. Their 
declined nutritional and functional status together with advanced age could 
increase the risk for postoperative complications. Nutrition evaluation should 
be part of the preoperative workup, and timely interventions should be initiated 
if needed, especially in geriatric patients.
