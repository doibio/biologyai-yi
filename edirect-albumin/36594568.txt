OBJECTIVE: The symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease may lead to reduced 
food consumption and in turn, malnutrition. It is therefore important to apply a 
reliable nutrition screening tool to evaluate the nutritional status of 
individuals with Parkinson's disease. This cross-sectional study aims to compare 
the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) questionnaire and the Geriatric Nutrition 
Risk Index (GNRI) in the assessment of the nutritional status of individuals 
with Parkinson's disease, and to evaluate the usability of the GNRI in cases of 
Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: The study was conducted with 89 individuals over the age of 60 who were 
diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Study data were collected using a 
questionnaire form administered through face-to-face interviews, the MNA-Long 
Form (MNA-LF), and the GNRI was calculated.
RESULTS: The mean GNRI scores were significantly lower in the participants with 
malnutrition (106.5 ± 19.4) than in the participants at risk of malnutrition 
(121.0 ± 10.3) and the participants with no malnutrition (125.3 ± 9.6) according 
to the MNA-LF (p < 0.001). Although there was a positive correlation between the 
MNA-LF and the GNRI scores, this correlation was not significant (p = 0.095).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to research the nutritional status of 
individuals with Parkinson's disease using the GNRI. The malnutrition rate 
detected by GNRI was found to be lower than MNA in Parkinson's patients 
receiving outpatient treatment. Similar studies are recommended to determine the 
usability of GNRI on inpatients.
