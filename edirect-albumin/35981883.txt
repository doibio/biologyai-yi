BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a preventable and curable disease, but 
mortality remains high among those who develop sepsis and critical illness from 
TB.
METHODS: This was a population-based, multicentre retrospective cohort study of 
patients admitted to all 15 publicly funded Hong Kong adult intensive care units 
(ICUs) between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2019. 940 adult critically ill patients 
with at least one positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) culture were 
identified out of 133 858 ICU admissions. Generalised linear modelling was used 
to determine the impact of delay in TB treatment on hospital mortality. Trend of 
annual Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV-adjusted 
standardised mortality ratio (SMR) over the 11-year period was analysed by 
Mann-Kendall's trend test.
RESULTS: ICU and hospital mortality were 24.7% (232/940) and 41.1% (386/940), 
respectively. Of those who died in the ICU, 22.8% (53/232) never received 
antituberculosis drugs. SMR for ICU patients with TB remained unchanged over the 
study period (Kendall's τb=0.37, p=0.876). After adjustment for age, Charlson 
comorbidity index, APACHE IV, albumin, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and 
renal replacement therapy, delayed TB treatment was directly associated with 
hospital mortality. In 302/940 (32.1%) of patients, TB could only be established 
from MTB cultures alone as Ziehl-Neelsen staining or PCR was either not 
performed or negative. Among this group, only 31.1% (94/302) had concurrent MTB 
PCR performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of ICU patients with TB has not improved over the last 
decade and mortality remains high. Delay in TB treatment was associated with 
higher hospital mortality. Use of MTB PCR may improve diagnostic yield and 
facilitate early treatment.
