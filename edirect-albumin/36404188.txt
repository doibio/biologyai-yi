OBJECTIVE: There is increased interest in studying ATTR-CA, a pathology that 
primarily affects patients of geriatric age and is frequently underdiagnosed. We 
aim to establish the prevalence of ATTR-CA in a cohort of patients with a 
history of HFpEF and to describe its characteristics.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study. Patients ≥75 years, 
clinical history of HFpEF, atrial dilation ≥34ml/m2 and left ventricular wall 
thickening >13mm, were included. Demographic and analytical parameters were 
collected, and a comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed, along with a 
transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac scintigraphy. Finally, telephone 
follow-up was carried out at 6 and 12 months.
RESULTS: 50 patients were recruited, mean age 86±6 years, 54% women. Age and 
functional class (I-II vs. III-IV) were factors associated with presenting with 
ATTR-CA. Patients with positive scintigraphy had a median time to admission of 
5.2 months (confidence interval [CI] 95% 0-10.9), while in those with negative 
scintigraphy, it was 12.2 months (95% CI 11.7-12.8); log-rank: p=0.064. Patients 
with positive scintigraphy had a median time to the combined endpoint (death and 
readmission) of 1.9 months (95% CI 0-6.1), and patients with negative 
scintigraphy of 11.9 months (95% CI 11.7-12); log-rank: p=0.027.
CONCLUSIONS: ATTR-CA appears to be a prevalent etiology in elderly patients 
within the spectrum of HFpEF. Patients with a diagnosis of ATTR-CA had a shorter 
time to admission for HF and the combined event of death and admission than 
patients with a negative result on scintigraphy.
