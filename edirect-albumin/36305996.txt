PURPOSE: The present study aims to evaluate the serum concentrations of 25 
hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D] in individuals aged ≥80 years, independent, 
free-living in Sao Paulo, Brazil (Lat 23.5 oS), and to investigate their 
associations with musculoskeletal system, physical performance and health 
markers.
METHOD: This cross-sectional study included 212 community dwellers aged ≥80 
years and evaluated serum 25(OH)D, PTH, calcium, albumin, phosphorus, 
creatinine, bone markers, and bone mineral density. Physical performance was 
evaluated with stationary march, Flamingo, and functional reach tests, 
questionnaires to assess falls and fractures in the previous year, energy 
expenditure (MET), and Charlson index. Physical activity was evaluated with the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) was observed in 56% and severe vitamin 
D deficiency (<10 ng/mL) in 13% of those individuals. Serum concentrations of 
25(OH)D were significantly and positively associated with BMD total hip 
(p = 0.001), femoral neck (p = 0.011) and 33% radius (p = 0.046) BMDs, MET 
(p = 0.03) and functional reach test (p = 0.037) and negatively with age 
(p = 0.021), PTH (p = 0.004) and osteoporosis diagnosis (p = 0.012). Long-lived 
individuals with 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL had higher total hip and femoral neck BMDs 
(p = 0.012 and p = 0.014, respectively) and lower PTH (p = 0.030). In multiple 
linear regression analysis, age and osteoporosis diagnosis remained negatively 
associated with 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.021 and p = 0.001, respectively), while 
corrected calcium and cholecalciferol use remained positively associated 
(p = 0.001 and p = 0.024, respectively).
CONCLUSION: We observed high vitamin D inadequacy prevalence in those Brazilian 
community dwellers' oldest old. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were positively 
associated with bone mass and dynamic balance, and negatively with PTH and 
osteoporosis diagnosis. Additionally, 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL was associated with 
better bone mass and lower PTH levels.
