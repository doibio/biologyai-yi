Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism consisting of active vitamin D and 
calcium aims to alleviate hypocalcemia but fails to restore normal parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) physiology. PTH replacement therapy is the ideal physiologic 
treatment for hypoparathyroidism. The double-blind, placebo-controlled, 26-week, 
phase 3 PaTHway trial assessed the efficacy and safety of PTH replacement 
therapy for hypoparathyroidism individuals with the investigational drug 
TransCon PTH (palopegteriparatide). Participants (n = 84) were randomized 3:1 to 
once-daily TransCon PTH (initially 18 μg/d) or placebo, both co-administered 
with conventional therapy. The study drug and conventional therapy were titrated 
according to a dosing algorithm guided by serum calcium. The composite primary 
efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants at week 26 who achieved 
normal albumin-adjusted serum calcium levels (8.3-10.6 mg/dL), independence from 
conventional therapy (requiring no active vitamin D and ≤600 mg/d of calcium), 
and no increase in study drug over 4 weeks before week 26. Other outcomes of 
interest included health-related quality of life measured by the 36-Item Short 
Form Survey (SF-36), hypoparathyroidism-related symptoms, functioning, and 
well-being measured by the Hypoparathyroidism Patient Experience Scale (HPES), 
and urinary calcium excretion. At week 26, 79% (48/61) of participants treated 
with TransCon PTH versus 5% (1/21) wiplacebo met the composite primary efficacy 
endpoint (p < 0.0001). TransCon PTH treatment demonstrated a significant 
improvement in all key secondary endpoint HPES domain scores (all p < 0.01) and 
the SF-36 Physical Functioning subscale score (p = 0.0347) compared with 
placebo. Additionally, 93% (57/61) of participants treated with TransCon PTH 
achieved independence from conventional therapy. TransCon PTH treatment 
normalized mean 24-hour urine calcium. Overall, 82% (50/61) treated with 
TransCon PTH and 100% (21/21) wiplacebo experienced adverse events; most were 
mild (46%) or moderate (46%). No study drug-related withdrawals occurred. In 
conclusion, TransCon PTH maintained normocalcemia while permitting independence 
from conventional therapy and was well-tolerated in individuals with 
hypoparathyroidism. © 2022 The Authors. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research
