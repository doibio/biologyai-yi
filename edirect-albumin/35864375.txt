Circulating cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) has emerged as a promising biomarker of 
ageing, tissue damage and cellular stress. However, less is known about health 
behaviours, ageing phenotypes and metabolic processes that lead to elevated 
cf-DNA levels. We sought to analyse the relationship of circulating cf-DNA level 
to age, sex, smoking, physical activity, vegetable consumption, ageing 
phenotypes (physical functioning, the number of diseases, frailty) and an 
extensive panel of biomarkers including blood and urine metabolites and 
inflammatory markers in three human cohorts (N = 5385; 17-82 years). The 
relationships were assessed using correlation statistics, and linear and 
penalised regressions (the Lasso), also stratified by sex.cf-DNA levels were 
significantly higher in men than in women, and especially in middle-aged men and 
women who smoke, and in older more frail individuals. Correlation statistics of 
biomarker data showed that cf-DNA level was higher with elevated inflammation 
(C-reactive protein, interleukin-6), and higher levels of homocysteine, and 
proportion of red blood cells and lower levels of ascorbic acid. Inflammation 
(C-reactive protein, glycoprotein acetylation), amino acids (isoleucine, 
leucine, tyrosine), and ketogenesis (3-hydroxybutyrate) were included in the 
cf-DNA level-related biomarker profiles in at least two of the cohorts.In 
conclusion, circulating cf-DNA level is different by sex, and related to health 
behaviour, health decline and metabolic processes common in health and disease. 
These results can inform future studies where epidemiological and biological 
pathways of cf-DNA are to be analysed in details, and for studies evaluating 
cf-DNA as a potential clinical marker.
