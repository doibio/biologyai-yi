BACKGROUND: Nutritional status is related to clinical outcomes in patients with 
chronic heart failure (CHF). The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is a simple 
tool to assess nutrition.
AIM: To evaluate the association between the PNI score and clinical outcomes in 
patients (60 years and older) hospitalized due to an acute exacerbation of CHF.
METHOD: This was a retrospective observational study. Patients hospitalized for 
acute CHF exacerbation between July 2015 and May 2020 were analyzed. Patients 
were followed until January 31, 2021. The primary end point was 
cardiovascular-related readmissions and all-cause mortality after hospital 
discharge. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with all-cause mortality. 
Patients were divided into normal nutrition (PNI > 38), moderate malnutrition 
(PNI = 35-38), and severe malnutrition (PNI < 35) groups.
RESULTS: The study included 355 patients (mean age 78 ± 9 years). The median 
follow-up was 769 days. Compared to survivors (n = 214), patients who expired 
(n = 133) were (1) older; (2) had lower PNI scores, lymphocyte counts, 
hemoglobin, albumin, total cholesterol, and serum sodium level; but (3) had 
higher serum creatinine levels, log(N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), 
and cardiac troponin I (P < 0.05). Multivariate analyses revealed that PNI was 
independently associated with all-cause mortality. The hazard ratio (HR) for 
moderate malnutrition versus normal nutrition was 1.624 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.011-2.609, P = 0.045), while HR for severe malnutrition versus normal 
nutrition was 1.892 (95%CI 1.119-3.198, P = 0.017). Malnourished patients had 
significantly higher rates of cardiovascular readmissions and all-cause 
mortality.
CONCLUSION: Lower PNI (malnutrition) was associated with worse clinical outcomes 
and was independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with CHF.
