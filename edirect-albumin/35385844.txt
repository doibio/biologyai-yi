BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aim of this study was to compare therapeutic responses 
and prognosis between elderly and nonelderly ulcerative colitis (UC) patients 
with moderate-to-severe activity.
METHODS: 148 UC patients with moderate-to-severe activity hospitalized between 
2000 and 2019 were enrolled consecutively, including 74 patients with the age of 
diagnosis over 60 years and 74 patients diagnosed less than 60 years. Patients 
were matched by gender, duration (±15%), disease activity, and admission time 
(±1 year). They were followed up until the latest medical record or December 
2019. The primary outcome was UC-related colectomy or death.
RESULTS: 148 patients were followed over median 37.5 months. For steroid use, 
76.8% of elderly UC patients were responsive, lower than that in adult group 
(85.7%). A decreased level of clinical activity index (2.0 [-1.5 to 4.00] vs. 
6.0 [3.0-8.0], p < 0.001), reduction of C-reactive protein (23.9 [3.5-65.5] vs. 
27.8 [9.7-58.1] mg/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (9.0 [-1.3 to 30.5] 
vs. 15.5 [3.8-36.5] mm/h) at 4 weeks after steroid induction was less obvious in 
the elderly. More elderly patients manifested steroid dependence and resistance. 
28.4% of elderly UC patients took colectomy, remarkably more than adult patients 
(12.2%), which also occurred earlier (8.0 [0.5-44.75] vs. 39.5 [12-57.38] 
months, p = 0.001). Aging (hazard ratio [HR] 2.868, 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1.290-6.375, p = 0.01), male, steroid resistance, and occurrence of 
complications were independently related to colectomy. The rate of serious 
infections was significantly higher in the elderly (55.4% vs. 35.1%, p = 0.013), 
mainly including cytomegalovirus infection, bacterial infection, and 
extraintestinal infection. Aging (odds ratio [OR] 2.774, 95% CI: 1.355-5.675, p 
= 0.015), extensive colonic involvement, steroid resistance, and biologics usage 
were independently associated with a high risk of concomitant infections.
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with moderate-to-severe UC experienced more 
treatment failure and increased risk of UC-related colectomy, mortality, and 
severe infections, predicting demand for more strict and individualized 
management.
