BACKGROUND: NAFLD is common in primary care. Liver fibrosis stage 2 or higher 
(≥F2) increases future risk of morbidity and mortality. We developed and 
validated a score to aid in the initial assessment of liver fibrosis for NAFLD 
in primary care.
METHODS: Data from patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were extracted from the 
NASH Clinical Research Network observational study ( n = 676). Using logistic 
regression and machine-learning methods, we constructed prediction models to 
distinguish ≥F2 from F0/1. The models were tested in participants in a trial 
("FLINT," n = 280) and local patients with NAFLD with magnetic resonance 
elastography data ( n = 130). The final model was applied to examinees in the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III ( n = 11,953) to 
correlate with long-term mortality.
RESULTS: A multivariable logistic regression model was selected as the 
Steatosis-Associated Fibrosis Estimator (SAFE) score, which consists of age, 
body mass index, diabetes, platelets, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, 
and globulins (total serum protein minus albumin). The model yielded areas under 
receiver operating characteristic curves ≥0.80 in distinguishing F0/1 from ≥F2 
in testing data sets, consistently higher than those of Fibrosis-4 and NAFLD 
Fibrosis Scores. The negative predictive values in ruling out ≥F2 at SAFE of 0 
were 88% and 92% in the two testing sets. In the NHANES III set, survival up to 
25 years of subjects with SAFE < 0 was comparable to that of those without 
steatosis ( p = 0.34), whereas increasing SAFE scores correlated with shorter 
survival with an adjusted HR of 1.53 ( p < 0.01) for subjects with SAFE > 100.
CONCLUSION: The SAFE score, which uses widely available variables to estimate 
liver fibrosis in patients diagnosed with NAFLD, may be used in primary care to 
recognize low-risk NAFLD.
