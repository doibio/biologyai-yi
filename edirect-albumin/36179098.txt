OBJECTIVES: Subjective aging, indexed by subjective age and self-perceptions of 
aging (SPA), is consistently related to cognition in adulthood. The present 
study examined whether blood biomarkers mediate the longitudinal associations 
between subjective aging indices and memory.
METHODS: Data of 5,369 individuals aged 50-94 years (mean = 66.89 years, SD = 
9.22; 60% women) were drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). 
Subjective age, SPA, and demographic factors were assessed in 2012/2014. 
Interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, albumin, cystatin C, N-terminal pro B-type 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), fasting glucose, Vitamin D, hemoglobin, red 
cells distribution width, and epigenetic aging were assessed as part of the HRS 
Venuous Blood Study in 2016. Memory was measured in 2018. The mediators (except 
for epigenetic aging, which was assessed in a subsample) were tested 
simultaneously in models that accounted for demographic covariates.
RESULTS: An older subjective age was related to worse memory partially through 
higher fasting glucose, higher cystatin C, higher NT-proBNP, and accelerated 
epigenetic aging. Negative SPA was related to worse memory through lower Vitamin 
D3, higher fasting glucose, higher cystatin C, higher NT-proBNP, and accelerated 
epigenetic aging. The biomarkers explained between 2% and 10% of subjective age 
and between 1% and 8% of SPA associations with memory. Additional analysis 
revealed that biomarkers continued to be significant mediators when physical 
inactivity and depressive symptoms were included as additional mediators.
CONCLUSION: The present study adds to existing research on the association 
between subjective aging and memory by providing new evidence on the biological 
mediators of this association.
