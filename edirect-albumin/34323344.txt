BACKGROUND: The benefit of a stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) is not certain 
for older patients, particularly in the surgical context.
AIMS: The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with an 
unfavourable outcome in this population.
DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive, monocentric study conducted in the surgical 
ICU of a French university hospital.
METHODS: Patients aged ≥75 years admitted in the surgical ICU for a predicted 
length of stay ≥48 hours were included. Patients received an initial and a 
6-months nutritional and functional assessment performed by physicians and 
nurses. The outcome was considered as favourable if the Katz Activities of Daily 
Living (ADL) variation (ADL delta = 6-months ADL - ICU admission ADL) was 
between 0 and -0.5 point 6 months after ICU discharge and unfavourable if the 
ADL delta decreased by more than 0.5 points or if the patient had died 6 months 
after ICU discharge.
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients-32 (57%) male-aged 79 [77; 83] y were included. ICU 
mortality was 19%; 6-month mortality was 22%. Median ADL delta was -0.5 [-0.5-0] 
points. A low ADL score (P = .0438) and a low albumin level (P = .0213) at 
admission were the two independent factors associated with an unfavourable 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: Mortality and loss of independence were high in this elderly 
population during and after their surgical ICU stay. The benefit of a systematic 
collaboration between intensive care specialists, ICU nurses, and geriatricians, 
to assess and manage nutritional and functional problems and to prevent a 
pejorative outcome in patients over 75 years old admitted in surgical ICU needs 
to be studied.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: There should be systematic screening for 
objective markers of undernutrition and frailty on ICU admission of older 
patients as they are associated with a poor prognosis.
