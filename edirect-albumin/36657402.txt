INTRODUCTION: Immunosenescence is associated with changes in lymphocyte 
function, thymus atrophy, and a chronic inflammatory process referred to as 
"inflammaging," which may in part be linked to eating disorders.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence rate of 
immunological alterations, including immune risk profile (IRP), and their 
association with body composition in the oldest old individuals.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 201 older adults aged 80 years and over, 
able to walk unaided, with no cognitive or immunological impairment, and with no 
serious diseases was conducted. Blood samples were collected between 2012 and 
2014 during the morning period, and the following tests were conducted: urea, 
creatinine, hemogram, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, transferrin, 
albumin, 25-OH vitamin D, and high-sensitivity CRP. Plasma cytokines were 
measured and mononuclear cell counts were performed by flow cytometry. 
Anthropometric measurements and densitometry using dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) were performed to assess body composition.
RESULTS: Mean age was 84.4 ± 3.7 years, and the numbers of T cells were CD4, 
784.0 cell/µL; CD8, 371.0 cell/µL; and CD4/CD8, 2.4. The rate of CD4/CD8 <1 
(IRP) was 9.4%, CD4/CD8 1-5 was 85.6%, while CD4/CD8 >5 was only 5.5%. CRP, 
tumor necrosis factor, IL1, IL4, IL6, and IL10 variables showed a high 
coefficient of variation but low mean values of 1.1 ± 3.1 mg/L for CRP 
(reference range <3 mg/L) and 3.9 ± 5.0 pg/mL for IL6 (reference range <7.0 
pg/mL). The same pattern was found for all other inflammatory variables 
assessed, characterizing a population whose values indicated low level of 
inflammation, considering age. Lean mass, as measured by DXA, was higher in men 
than in women, while the inverse was found for fat % (p < 0.001). A positive 
association between CRP values and DXA fat % (p value: 0.007, r: 0.49) and a 
negative association between CRP values and DXA lean mass (p value: 0.046, 
r:-0.37) was observed.
CONCLUSION: In the independent oldest old, IRP rate proved low and 
high-sensitivity CRP was shown to be associated with body composition.
