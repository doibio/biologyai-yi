Circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers may be influenced by chronic 
psychological stressors such as those experienced by family caregivers. However, 
previous studies have found mostly small and inconsistent differences between 
caregivers and control samples on individual measures of systemic inflammation. 
Latent variables of inflammation were extracted from six biomarkers collected 
from two blood samples over 9Â years apart for 502 participants in a national 
cohort study. One-half of these participants transitioned into a sustained 
family caregiving role between the blood samples. Two latent factors, termed 
"up-regulation" and "inhibitory feedback," were identified, and the transition 
to family caregiving was associated with a lower increase over time on the 
inhibitory feedback factor indexed by interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10. No 
caregiving effect was found on the up-regulation factor indexed primarily by 
IL-6 and C-reactive protein. These findings illustrate the advantages of using 
latent variable models to study inflammation in response to caregiving stress.
