BACKGROUND: Declined renal function is associated with physical function 
impairment and frailty in a graded fashion. This study aimed to examine the 
relationship between renal function, frailty and physical performance with 
mortality in older patients with diabetes, while also determining their combined 
effects on patient outcome.
METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted in elderly patients 
with diabetes. Kidney disease staging was based on clinical practice guidelines 
of the International Society of Nephrology, and chronic kiney disease (CKD) was 
defined as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) > 30 mg/g, persistent 
reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 mL/min per 
1.73 m2 or both. The modified Rockwood frailty index (RFI) was composed of 
cumulative health deficits, and physical function was determined by handgrip 
strength (HGS). Additionally, a timed up and go (TUG) test was assessed at 
baseline. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazard analyses were used 
to analyze the association between CKD, frailty, physical function and 
mortality.
RESULTS: For the 921 enrolled patients, their mean age was 82.0 ± 6.7 years. 
After a median 2.92 (interquartile range [IQR] 1.06-4.43) year follow-up, the 
survival rate was 67.6% and 85.5% in patients with and without CKD, 
respectively. The mortality hazard ratio (crude HR) with CKD was 5.92 for those 
with an RFI higher than 0.313 (95% CI 3.44-10.18), 2.50 for a TUG time longer 
than 21 s (95% CI 1.22-5.13), and 2.67 for an HGS lower than 10.57 kg in females 
or 20.4 kg in males (95% CI 1.12-6.37). After multivariate adjustment, the 
mortality hazard ratio for an RFI ≥ 0.313 was 5.34 (95% CI 2.23-12.80) in CKD 
patients, but not in patients without CKD. In subgroup analysis, patients 
experiencing CKD and frailty, or physical function impairment, had the lowest 
survival proportion followed by only frailty/declined physical function, only 
CKD, without CKD, and non-frailty/non-physical impairment.
CONCLUSION: CKD, frailty and physical function impairment were all associated 
with an increased mortality risk in older patients with diabetes, while the 
combined effects of these 3 factors were seen on patient outcome.
