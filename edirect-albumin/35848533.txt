BACKGROUND: There were controversies for the association between computed 
tomography (CT)-determined low skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and overall survival 
(OS) in gastric cancer (GC). In this study, we investigated whether cachexia 
could be a potential confounding variable for this issue.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected the patients of GC in our institution 
between July 2016 and January 2021. Preoperative SMM was determined by analyzing 
the skeletal muscle index of L3 with abdominal CT, and the cut-offs for low SMM 
were defined as <52.4 (men) and < 38.5 cm2 /m2 (women), respectively. Overall 
survival (OS) was the primary endpoint.
RESULTS: Of the 255 included GC patients, 117 (46%) were classified as having 
low SMM. Those with low SMM were associated with a higher level of circulating 
interleukin 6 and C reactive protein but a lower level of albumin than those of 
normal SMM. The univariate analysis showed that low SMM, tumor-node-metastasis 
(TNM) stage, body mass index (BMI), postoperative chemotherapy, and cachexia 
were significantly associated with OS, while in the multivariate analysis, only 
low SMM and TNM stage were significantly associated with OS. Kaplan-Meier 
survival curves with log-rank tests indicated that low SMM significantly 
predicted worse OS of GC. After grouping by cachexia, the low SMM significantly 
predicted worse OS in patients with cachexia instead of those without cachexia.
CONCLUSIONS: CT-determined low SMM predicts worse OS of GC in patients with 
cachexia instead of those without cachexia, and greater attention should be paid 
to such patients with synchronous low SMM and cachexia.
