BACKGROUND: The prediction of long-term mortality following acute illness can be 
unreliable for older patients, inhibiting the delivery of targeted clinical 
interventions. The difficulty plausibly arises from the complex, multifactorial 
nature of the underlying biology in this population, which flexible, multimodal 
models based on machine learning may overcome. Here, we test this hypothesis by 
quantifying the comparative predictive fidelity of such models in a large 
consecutive sample of older patients acutely admitted to hospital and 
characterise their biological support.
METHODS: A set of 804 admission episodes involving 616 unique patients with a 
mean age of 84.5 years consecutively admitted to the Acute Geriatric service at 
University College Hospital were identified, in whom clinical diagnoses, blood 
tests, cognitive status, computed tomography of the head, and mortality within 
600 days after admission were available. We trained and evaluated out-of-sample 
an array of extreme gradient boosted trees-based predictive models of 
incrementally greater numbers of investigational modalities and modelled 
features. Both linear and non-linear associations with investigational features 
were quantified.
RESULTS: Predictive models of mortality showed progressively increasing fidelity 
with greater numbers of modelled modalities and dimensions. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve rose from 0.67 (sd = 0.078) for age and 
sex to 0.874 (sd = 0.046) for the most comprehensive model. Extracranial bone 
and soft tissue features contributed more than intracranial features towards 
long-term mortality prediction. The anterior cingulate and angular gyri, and 
serum albumin, were the greatest intracranial and biochemical model contributors 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: High-dimensional, multimodal predictive models of mortality based 
on routine clinical data offer higher predictive fidelity than simpler models, 
facilitating individual level prognostication and interventional targeting. The 
joint contributions of both extracranial and intracranial features highlight the 
potential importance of optimising somatic as well as neural functions in 
healthy ageing. Our findings suggest a promising path towards a high-fidelity, 
multimodal index of frailty.
