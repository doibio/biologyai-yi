BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a long-term malignancy that causes 
high morbidities and mortalities worldwide. Notably, long non-coding RNAs 
(LncRNAs) have been identified as candidate targets for malignancy treatments.
METHODS: LncRNA LINC01116 and its Pearson-correlated genes (PCGs) were 
identified and analyzed in HCC patients. The diagnostic and prognostic value of 
the lncRNA was evaluated using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 
Further, we explored the target drugs of LINC01116 for clinical application. 
Relationships between immune infiltration and PCGs, methylation and PCGs were 
explored. The diagnostic potentials were then validated by Oncomine cohorts.
RESULTS: LINC01116 and the PCG OLFML2B are differentially and highly expressed 
in tumor tissues (both P ≤ 0.050). We found that LINC01116, TMSB15A, PLAU, 
OLFML2B, and MRC2 have diagnostic potentials (all AUC ≥ 0.700, all P ≤ 0.050) 
while LINC01116 and TMSB15A have prognostic significance (both adjusted 
P ≤ 0.050). LINC01116 was enriched in the vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) receptor signaling pathway, mesenchyme morphogenesis, etc. After that, 
candidate target drugs with potential clinical significance were identified: 
Thiamine, Cromolyn, Rilmenidine, Chlorhexidine, Sulindac_sulfone, 
Chloropyrazine, and Meprylcaine. Analysis of immune infiltration revealed that 
MRC2, OLFML2B, PLAU, and TMSB15A are negatively associated with the purity but 
positively associated with the specific cell types (all P < 0.050). Analysis of 
promoter methylation demonstrated that MRC2, OLFML2B, and PLAU have differential 
and high methylation levels in primary tumors (all P < 0.050). Validation 
results of the differential expressions and diagnostic potential of OLFML2B 
(Oncomine) were consistent with those obtained in the TCGA cohort (P < 0.050, 
AUC > 0.700).
CONCLUSIONS: Differentially expressed LINC01116 could be a candidate diagnostic 
and an independent prognostic signature in HCC. Besides, its target drugs may 
work for HCC therapy via the VEGF receptor signaling pathway. Differentially 
expressed OLFML2B could be a diagnostic signature involved in HCC via immune 
infiltrates.
