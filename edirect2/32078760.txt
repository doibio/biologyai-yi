Based on the finding that a central antihypertensive agent with high affinity 
for I1-type imidazoline receptors - rilmenidine, shows cytotoxic effects on 
cultured cancer cell lines, it has been suggested that imidazoline receptors 
agonists might have a therapeutic potential in the cancer therapy. Nevertheless, 
potential rilmenidine side effects caused by activation of α-adrenoceptors, or 
other associated receptors and enzymes, might hinder its therapeutic benefits. 
Considering that human α-adrenoceptors belong to the rhodopsin-like class A of 
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) it is reasonable to assume that imidazolines 
might have the affinity for other receptors from the same class. Therefore, to 
investigate possible off-target effects of imidazoline ligands we have prepared 
a reverse docking protocol on class A GPCRs, using imidazoline ligands and their 
decoys. To verify our in silico results, three ligands with high scores and 
three ligands with low scores were tested for antagonistic activity on α2 - 
adrenoceptors.
