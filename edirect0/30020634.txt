Deep neck infections are a serious but treatable group of infections affecting 
the deep cervical space and characterized by rapid progression and 
life-threatening complications. These infections remain an important health 
problem with significant morbidity and potential mortality. These infections 
most frequently arise from the local extension of infections from tonsils, 
parotid glands, cervical lymph nodes, and odontogenic structures. They 
classically present with symptoms related to local pressure effects on the 
respiratory, nervous, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract (particularly neck 
mass/swelling/induration, dysphagia, dysphonia, and trismus). The specific 
presenting symptoms will depend on the deep neck space involved (parapharyngeal, 
retropharyngeal, prevertebral, submental, masticator, etc).
