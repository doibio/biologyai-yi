BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess early graft failure after 
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction according to chronicity of ACL 
deficiency (ACLD) and clarify predisposing factors.
METHODS: A total of 731 patients who underwent anatomic ACL reconstruction were 
divided into 3 groups based on chronicity of ACLD: <6 months (Group 1), 6 months 
to 2 years (Group 2), and >2 years (Group 3). Types of ACL grafts used included 
single-bundle hamstring tendon (HT), multiple-bundle HT, and rectangular 
bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) grafts. Preoperatively and immediately 
postoperatively, lateral radiographs in full extension were taken to examine 
anterior tibial subluxation (ATS). All ACL grafts were evaluated by MRI at 6 
months to identify graft failure. The group with the highest failure rate was 
further examined to compare possible risk factors between the intact and failure 
subgroups, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify 
predisposing factors.
RESULTS: Early graft failure on MRI without any episode of postoperative trauma 
was observed in 7 (1.4%), 2 (1.8%), and 11 (9.2%) patients in Groups 1, 2, and 
3, respectively, with a significantly higher rate in Group 3 (P < 0.001). Of the 
119 patients in Group 3, significant differences were observed between intact 
and failure subgroups with regard to surgical procedure (P = 0.03), chondral 
lesions (P < 0.01), and preoperative ATS (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis revealed that surgical procedures (odds ratio, 3.8; 95%CI, 
1.16-12.59) and preoperative ATS (odd ratio, 2.4; 95%CI, 1.26-4.38) were 
predisposing factors of early graft failure.
CONCLUSION: Patients with ACLD for >2 years experienced early graft failure with 
an incidence rate of 9.2%. Predisposing factors of early graft failure in these 
patients included the use of single-bundle HT grafts and preoperative ATS. The 
use of rectangular BTB grafts resulted in a lower graft failure rate.
