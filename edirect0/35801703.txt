BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery can cause type 2 diabetes (diabetes) remission for 
individuals with comorbid obesity, yet utilization is <1%. Surgery eligibility 
is currently limited to body mass index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m 2 , though the American 
Diabetes Association recommends expansion to BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 .
OBJECTIVE: We estimate the individual-level net social value benefits of 
diabetes remission through bariatric surgery and compare the population-level 
effects of expanding eligibility alone versus improving utilization for 
currently eligible individuals.
METHODS: Using microsimulation, we quantified the net social value (difference 
in lifetime health/economic benefits and costs) of bariatric surgery-related 
diabetes remission for Americans with obesity and diabetes. We compared 
projected lifetime surgical outcomes to conventional management at individual 
and population levels for current utilization (1%) and eligibility (BMI ≥35 kg/m 
2 ) and expansions of both (>1%, and BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 ).
RESULTS: The per capita net social value of bariatric surgery-related diabetes 
remission was $264,670 (95% confidence interval: $234,527-294,814) under current 
and $227,114 (95% confidence interval: $205,300-248,928) under expanded 
eligibility, an 11.1% and 9.16% improvement over conventional management. 
Quality-adjusted life expectancy represented the largest gains (current: 
$194,706; expanded: $169,002); followed by earnings ($51,395 and $46,466), and 
medical savings ($41,769 and $34,866) balanced against the surgery cost 
($23,200). Doubling surgical utilization for currently eligible patients 
provides higher population gains ($34.9B) than only expanding eligibility at 
current utilization ($29.0B).
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes remission following bariatric surgery improves healthy 
life expectancy and provides net social benefit despite high procedural costs. 
Per capita benefits appear greater among currently eligible individuals. 
Therefore, policies that increase utilization may produce larger societal value 
than expanding eligibility criteria alone.
