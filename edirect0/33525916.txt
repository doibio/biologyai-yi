STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
OBJECTIVES: Although the role of surgery in the management of metastatic spinal 
cord compression (MSCC) has been well established, elderly patients may still be 
denied surgery because of higher risk of complications and shorter life 
expectancy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether elderly patients 
with MSCC could benefit from surgery and discuss the criteria for surgical 
decision-making in such patients.
METHODS: Enrolled in this study were 55 consecutive patients aged 75 years or 
older who were surgically treated for MSCC in our center. Prognostic factors 
predicting overall survival (OS) were explored by the Kaplan-Meier method and 
Cox regression model. The quality of life (QoL) of the patients was evaluated by 
the SOSGOQ and compared using Student's t test. Risk factors for postoperative 
complications were identified by Chi-square test and multiple logistic 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: Surgical treatment for MSCC substantially improved the neurological 
function in 55.8% patients and QoL in 88.5% patients with acceptable rates of 
postoperative complications (16.4%), reoperation (9.1%), and 30-day mortality 
(1.8%). Postoperative ECOG-PS of 1-2, total en-bloc spondylectomy (TES), and 
postoperative chemotherapy were favorable prognostic factors for OS, while a 
high Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and a long operation time were risk 
factors for postoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery should be encouraged for elderly patients with MSCC 1) who 
are compromised by the current or potential neurological dysfunction; 2) with 
radioresistant tumors; 3) with spinal instability; and 4) with no comorbidity, 
ECOG-PS of 0-2, and systemic treatment adherence. In addition, surgery should be 
performed by a skilled and experienced surgical team.
