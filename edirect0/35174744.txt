Carbon dots (CDs) have two unique advantages: one is ease of synthesis at low 
price, the other is desirable physical and chemical properties, such as 
ultra-small size, abundant surface functional groups, nontoxic/low-toxicity, 
good biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial and antioxidant activities etc. 
These advantages provide opportunities for the development of new food packaging 
enhancers and food preservatives. This paper systematically reviews the studies 
of CDs used to strengthen the physical properties of food packaging, including 
strengthen mechanical strength, ultraviolet (UV) barrier properties and water 
barrier properties. It also reviews the researches of CDs used to fabricate 
active packaging with antioxidant and/or antibacterial properties and 
intelligent packaging with the capacity of sensing the freshness of food. In 
addition, it analyzes the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of CDs as 
preservatives, and discusses the effect of CDs applied as coating agents and 
nano-level food additives for extension the shelf life of food samples. It also 
provides a brief review on the security and the release behavior of CDs.

Plain Language Summary: Collect and analyze the effect of CDs on enhancing the 
physical properties of protective food packaging.Discuss the active of CDs and 
their application in active intelligent packaging.Analyze the application of CDs 
as coating agent and nano-level food additives.Discuss the security of CDs, 
including toxicity and the release behavior.
