Individuals with mental illness have poorer physical health, nutritional status, 
and lowered life expectancy. Optimising their physical and nutritional status 
has become an increasingly important therapeutic goal. Current experience with 
COVID-19 has further emphasised the susceptibility to physical illness and 
poorer outcomes amongst individuals with mental illness and those who are 
nutritionally compromised. Although life as we knew it has been suspended until 
the widespread roll-out of a vaccine, individuals can take immediate action to 
improve physical and mental health by attending to and optimising their 
nutritional well-being. Clinicians within mental health services have a crucial 
role to play in assisting such change, and reminding their patients of the 
importance of pursuing a healthy and balanced diet.
