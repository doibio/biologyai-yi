In agriculture, horticulture and plantation forestry, Bacillus species are the 
most commonly applied antagonists and biopesticides, targeting plant pathogens 
and insect pests, respectively. Bacillus isolates are also used as bacterial 
plant biostimulants, or BPBs. Such useful isolates of Bacillus are typically 
sourced from soil. Here, we show that Bacillus - and other antagonistic microbes 
- can be sourced from a broad range of plant seeds. We found that culturable 
Bacillus isolates are common in the seeds of 98 plant species representing 39 
families (i.e., 87% of the commonly cultured bacteria belonged to Bacillales). 
We also found that 83% of the commonly cultured fungi from the seeds of the 98 
plant species belonged to just three orders of fungi-Pleosporales, Hypocreales 
and Eurotiales-that are also associated with antagonism. Furthermore, we 
confirmed antagonism potential in agaro with seed isolates of Bacillus from 
Pinus monticola as a representative case. Eight isolates each of seed Bacillus, 
seed fungi, and foliar fungi, all from P. monticola, were paired in a total of 
384 possible pair-wise interactions (with seed and foliar fungi as the targets). 
Seed Bacillus spp. were the strongest antagonists of the seed and foliar fungi, 
with a mean interaction strength 2.8 times greater than seed fungi (all either 
Eurotiales or Hypocreales) and 3.2 times greater than needle fungi. Overall, our 
study demonstrates that seeds host a taxonomically narrow group of culturable, 
antagonistic bacteria and fungi.
