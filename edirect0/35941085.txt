INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy for people with Down syndrome (DS) has increased 
to 60 years, although poor oral health affects their quality of life. Panoramic 
radiographs (PRs) are usually well-tolerated by people with DS and can provide 
valuable diagnostic data for treatment planning and research. Methods A scoping 
review of peer-reviewed articles published between 1971and 2021 was conducted in 
accordance with the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to determine the scope 
of use of PRs for people with DS.
RESULTS: 937 papers were screened, and 52 papers were included and charted into 
seven categories in this review. A high prevalence of tooth agenesis (TA) and 
other anomalies were reported in 45% of papers. Severe periodontal disease was 
considered characteristic of DS in the 1970s-80s and the benefit of 
time-consuming treatment was questioned. Since 2000 case reports illustrate that 
improved oral care, orthodontic treatment, and dental implants under local or 
general anaesthetic can improve the quality of life for people with DS.
CONCLUSION: PRs play an important role in the diagnosis of anomalies, 
periodontal disease, and implant planning for patients with DS. This review 
highlights the gaps in research of caries, pathology, TMJ, systemic disease 
indicators, and guidelines for dentists. Systematic PR viewing, with a knowledge 
of characteristic features of DS, will assist diagnosis of pathology and improve 
comprehensive dental care treatment planning for children and adults with DS.
