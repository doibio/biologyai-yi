OBJECTIVE: Telehealth is rapidly gaining ground from usual treatment, not least 
because of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) measures. Within rheumatology, 
telehealth has been used for, inter alia, follow-up for patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) with low disease activity or in remission. This study aims to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of such a telehealth intervention.
METHOD: In a randomized controlled trial, 294 patients were randomized into 
patient-reported outcome-based telehealth follow-up by either a nurse (PRO-TN) 
or a rheumatologist (PRO-TR) or to conventional outpatient follow-up (control). 
Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using costs per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained. Individual-level healthcare and productivity costs were retrieved 
from national Danish registers. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
calculated for the intervention groups compared to the control group. 
Bootstrapping with 10 000 replications was used to obtain confidence intervals. 
Furthermore, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated.
RESULTS: The cost comparison showed that PRO-TR was significantly less costly 
than the control group, whereas the relative reduction in costs for PRO-TN was 
not significant. The telehealth groups experienced minor, non-significant 
declines in QALYs, whereas the control group experienced a slight, 
non-significant increase. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that for 
PRO-TR, the willingness to accept a QALY loss was 89 328 EUR. A similar but 
smaller and non-significant result was seen for PRO-TN.
CONCLUSION: PRO-TR and PRO-TN seem to cost less but provide broadly similar 
health outcomes compared with conventional follow-up. Between the intervention 
groups, PRO-TR was significantly less costly. More studies are needed to 
conclude whether rheumatologist- or nurse-led telehealth is more cost-effective 
than conventional follow-up.
