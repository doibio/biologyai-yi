Consumers' interest in food with less and/or free from synthetic additives has 
increased considerably in recent years. In this context, researchers and 
industries have concentrated efforts on developing alternatives to these 
compounds. Replacing synthetic additives in meat products is a challenge, given 
their importance for sensory characteristics and food safety. Complementary 
technologies combined with the replacement and/or reduction of synthetic 
additives (hurdle technologies) has been studied focusing on the protection and 
extension of the shelf life of meat products. This review reports alternatives 
for replacing and/or reducing the use of synthetic additives in meat 
derivatives, aiming at the development of more natural and simpler meat 
products, familiar to consumers and considered clean labels.
