BACKGROUND: The Ross procedure is not commonly performed, owing to the 
procedural complexity and the risk of autograft and/or homograft reoperation. 
This study examined outcomes of patients undergoing Ross reinterventions at a 
dedicated Ross center.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 225 consecutive patients who underwent a 
Ross procedure between 1994 and 2019. Index and redo operation characteristics 
and outcomes were compared between patients with and those without redo 
operations. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent predictors of 
Ross-related reinterventions. Survival was estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (29.3%) required redo Ross surgery, 41 patients 
(18.2%) underwent autograft reoperation only, 8 patients (3.6%) had a homograft 
reintervention, and 17 patients (7.6%) had both autograft and homograft 
reoperations (12 as a combined procedure and 5 as sequential procedures). The 
mean time to reintervention was 11 ± 6 years for autograft reoperations and 
12 ± 7 years for homograft reoperations. Patients who underwent Ross-related 
reinterventions were younger (mean, 38 ± 11 years vs 43 ± 11 years; P < .01) and 
had a higher rate of New York Heart Association class III/IV (56% vs 38%; 
P = .02) at the index Ross procedure. Most patients undergoing autograft 
reintervention had aortic insufficiency and/or aneurysm (98.2%; 57 of 58). The 
primary reason for homograft reintervention was pulmonary stenosis (92%; 23 of 
25). The operative mortality of Ross reintervention was 1.5% (1 of 66). Survival 
at 15 years was similar in patients who required a redo operation and those who 
did not (91.2% vs 93.9%; P = .23).
CONCLUSIONS: Ross reinterventions can be performed safely and maintain patients 
at the normal life expectancy restored by the index Ross procedure up to 
15 years at experienced centers.
