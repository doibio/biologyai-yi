Solid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasms (SPEN), also known Frantz tumors, are 
rare pancreatic exocrine neoplasms with age and gender predisposition. This 
pathology was first described by Dr. Virginia Kneeland Frantz in 1959 and hence 
the name. Other names include solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas, 
solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN), papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, 
Hamoudi tumor, or Gruber-Frantz tumor. These are low grade with low malignant 
potential neoplasms commonly seen in young and adolescent females and rarely 
affects men . Accurate diagnosis of SPEN is of utmost importance since it has a 
low malignant potential, and with prompt diagnosis and surgery, the patients 
could have a long life expectancy including possible cure.
