OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term functional outcomes in patients who 
received primary radiotherapy for tumour-node stage T2N0 glottic carcinoma, 
stratified for tumour extension.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on patients who were treated with 
radiotherapy for T2N0 glottic carcinoma. Four questionnaires were used to 
measure different aspects of functional outcome. In addition, objective 
evaluation and perceptual analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients were included in this study. The median time between 
the start of radiotherapy and assessment was 42 months (range, 26-143 months). 
Patients reported high-level functioning, with low symptom scores and good 
swallowing function, and showed a median dysphonia grade of 1.5. The median 
Voice Handicap Index-30 score was 17.5.
CONCLUSION: Patients with T2N0 glottic carcinoma treated with radiotherapy had 
good long-term quality of life, with low symptom scores, good swallowing 
functioning and slightly elevated voice outcome parameters.
