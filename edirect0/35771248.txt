OBJECTIVES: Minimal extrathyroid extension (mETE) was removed from the TNM 
staging system. This study was designed prospectively to compare the safety and 
efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) versus surgery for treating T1N0M0 
papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) with sonographically detected mETE.
METHODS: From December 2019 to April 2021, 198 patients with T1N0M0 mETE-PTCs 
evaluated by preoperative ultrasound from 10 hospitals were included. Ninety-two 
patients elected MWA, and 106 patients elected surgery for treatment. MWA was 
performed using extensive ablation with hydrodissection. Surgery consisted of 
lobectomy with ipsilateral central lymph node dissection (CLD), lobe and isthmus 
excision with ipsilateral CLD and total thyroidectomy with ipsilateral CLD. The 
rates of technical success, cost, oncologic outcomes, complications and quality 
of life of the two groups were assessed.
RESULTS: The follow-up times for the MWA and surgery groups were 12.7 ± 4.1 and 
12.6 ± 5.0 months, respectively. The technical success rate was 100% for both 
groups. Oncological outcomes of the two groups were similar during the follow-up 
(all p > 0.05). The MWA group had a shorter operation time, less blood loss and 
lower costs (all p < 0.001). Three complications (3.3%) were reported in the MWA 
group and 4 (3.8%) in the surgery group (p = 0.846). The surgery group had 
higher scores for scar problems and anxiety (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Microwave ablation was comparable in the short term to surgery in 
terms of treatment safety and efficacy in selected patients with T1N0M0 mETE-PTC 
detected by ultrasound.
KEY POINTS: • Microwave ablation is comparable to surgery in the safety and 
short-term efficacy for PTCs with sonographically detected mETE. • Thermal 
ablation is technically feasible for mETE-PTC treatment. • Patients with 
mETE-PTC have similar quality of life in the two groups, except for worse scar 
problems and anxiety in the surgery group.
