BACKGROUND: Femoral hernias often present with incarceration or strangulation 
that requires emergency surgery. However, recommendations vary regarding optimal 
approaches for incarcerated femoral hernia. The aim of this study is to compare 
clinical efficacy between mesh repair and suture repair for the treatment of 
incarcerated femoral hernia.
METHODS: Retrospective, single-center analysis of the clinical data from 48 
patients with incarcerated femoral hernia, including 16 patients who underwent 
mesh repair (mesh repair group) and 32 patients who underwent traditional suture 
repair (suture repair group).
RESULTS: The mean age, body mass index, incarceration duration, hernia sac size, 
operation duration, and the rates of postoperative incision infection, 
recurrence, chronic pain, and mortality were not significantly different between 
the suture repair and mesh repair groups (P > 0.05 for all). In contrast, the 
female/male ratio; the rates of bowel obstruction, coexisting diseases, and 
nighttime operation; and the American Society of Anesthesiologists grade were 
higher and the rate of prophylactic antibiotic use and the mean cost of 
hospitalization were lower in the suture repair group than in the mesh repair 
group (P < 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSION: The surgical approach should be chosen based on the patient's 
condition. Mesh repair for the emergency treatment of incarcerated femoral 
hernia is safe and effective, whereas suture repair is suitable for elderly 
patients, those with more coexisting diseases, and those with limited life 
expectancy.
