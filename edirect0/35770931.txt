Decision models can combine information from different sources to simulate the 
long-term consequences of alternative strategies in the presence of uncertainty. 
A cohort state-transition model (cSTM) is a decision model commonly used in 
medical decision making to simulate the transitions of a hypothetical cohort 
among various health states over time. This tutorial focuses on time-independent 
cSTM, in which transition probabilities among health states remain constant over 
time. We implement time-independent cSTM in R, an open-source mathematical and 
statistical programming language. We illustrate time-independent cSTMs using a 
previously published decision model, calculate costs and effectiveness outcomes, 
and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of multiple strategies, including a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We provide open-source code in R to 
facilitate wider adoption. In a second, more advanced tutorial, we illustrate 
time-dependent cSTMs.
