Metaparametric Neural Networks for Survival Analysis.

De Mello FL, Wilkinson JM, Kadirkamanathan V.

Survival analysis is a critical tool for the modeling of time-to-event data, 
such as life expectancy after a cancer diagnosis or optimal maintenance 
scheduling for complex machinery. However, current neural network models provide 
an imperfect solution for survival analysis as they either restrict the shape of 
the target probability distribution or restrict the estimation to predetermined 
times. As a consequence, current survival neural networks lack the ability to 
estimate a generic function without prior knowledge of its structure. In this 
article, we present the metaparametric neural network framework that encompasses 
the existing survival analysis methods and enables their extension to solve the 
aforementioned issues. This framework allows survival neural networks to satisfy 
the same independence of generic function estimation from the underlying data 
structure that characterizes their regression and classification counterparts. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of the metaparametric framework 
using both simulated and large real-world datasets and show that it outperforms 
the current state-of-the-art methods in: 1) capturing nonlinearities and 2) 
identifying temporal patterns, leading to more accurate overall estimations 
while placing no restrictions on the underlying function structure.
