BACKGROUND: Long-term survival after surgery for severe aortic stenosis (AS) 
provides important information regarding the choice between surgical (SAVR) and 
transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement. This study investigated the 
long-term survival of AS patients with low or intermediate surgical risk who 
underwent SAVR or TAVR in our institution versus that of the Japanese general 
population.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2019, 1276 consecutive patients underwent SAVR or TAVR for 
severe AS. Among them, we retrospectively investigated those with low (n = 383) 
or intermediate (n = 137) surgical risk treated with SAVR and those with low 
(n = 86) or intermediate (n = 333) surgical risk treated with TAVR. Their 
post-intervention survival was compared with that of an age- and gender-matched 
Japanese general population.
RESULTS: The overall 5-year survival rate of SAVR for patients with low surgical 
risk (mean age, 72 ± 9 years) was not significantly different from that of the 
general population (90 % vs. 89 %, respectively; p = 0.58), whereas that of 
patients with intermediate surgical risk (77 ± 6 years) was significantly lower 
than that of the general population (77 % vs. 84 %, respectively; p = 0.03). 
After TAVR, the 5-year survival of patients with low (78 ± 8 years) or 
intermediate (83 ± 5 years) surgical risk was significantly lower than that of 
the general population (low risk, 64 % vs. 81 %, p < 0.01; intermediate risk, 
66 % vs. 71 %, respectively, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that long-term survival after SAVR for AS 
patients with low surgical risk was as good as that of the age- and 
gender-matched general population, while the long-term survival after SAVR for 
intermediate-risk or TAVR for low- or intermediate-risk patients was lower than 
that of the general population. These findings suggest that SAVR is an 
appropriate option for AS patients with low surgical risk and good life 
expectancy, especially in Japan, where the life expectancy is the longest 
worldwide.
