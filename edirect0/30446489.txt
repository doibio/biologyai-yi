Patients with a limited life expectancy use many medications, some of which may 
be questionable. OBJECTIVES : To identify possible solutions for difficulties 
concerning medication management and formulate recommendations to improve 
medication management at the end of life. METHODS : A two-round Delphi study 
with experts in the field of medication management and end-of-life care (based 
on ranking in the citation index in Web of Science and relevant publications). 
We developed a questionnaire with 58 possible solutions for problems regarding 
medication management at the end of life that were identified in previously 
performed studies. RESULTS : A total of 42 experts from 13 countries 
participated. Response rate in the first round was 93%, mean agreement between 
experts for all solutions was 87 % (range 62%-100%); additional suggestions were 
given by 51%. The response rate in the second round was 74%. Awareness, 
education and timely communication about medication management came forward as 
top priorities for guidelines. In addition, solutions considered crucial by many 
of the experts were development of a list of inappropriate medications at the 
end of life and incorporation of recommendations for end-of-life medication 
management in disease-specific guidelines. CONCLUSIONS : In this international 
Delphi study, experts reached a high level of consensus on recommendations to 
improve medication management in end-of-life care. These findings may contribute 
to the development of clinical practice guidelines for medication management in 
end-of-life care.
