BACKGROUND: U.S. veterans report high rates of traumatic experiences and mental 
health symptomology [e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]. The stress 
sensitization hypothesis posits experiences of adversity sensitize individuals 
to stress reactions which can lead to greater psychiatric problems. We extend 
this hypothesis by exploring how multiple adversities such as early childhood 
adversity, combat-related trauma, and military sexual trauma related to 
heterogeneity in stress over time and, subsequently, greater risk for PTSD.
METHODS: 1230 veterans were recruited for an observational, longitudinal study. 
Veterans responded to questionnaires on PTSD, stress, and traumatic experiences 
five times over an 18-month study period. We used latent transition analysis to 
understand how heterogeneity in adverse experiences is related to transition 
into stress trajectory classes. We also explored how transition patterns related 
to PTSD symptomology.
RESULTS: Across all models, we found support for stress sensitization. In 
general, combat trauma in combinations with other types of adverse experiences, 
namely early childhood adversity and military sexual trauma, imposed a greater 
probability of transitioning into higher risk stress profiles. We also showed 
differential effects of early childhood and military-specific adversity on PTSD 
symptomology.
CONCLUSION: The present study rigorously integrates both military-specific and 
early life adversity into analysis on stress sensitivity, and is the first to 
examine how sensitivity might affect trajectories of stress over time. Our study 
provides a nuanced, and specific, look at who is risk for sensitization to 
stress based on previous traumatic experiences as well as what transition 
patterns are associated with greater PTSD symptomology.
