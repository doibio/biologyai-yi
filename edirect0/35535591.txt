The study of the mortality differences between groups has traditionally focused 
on metrics that describe average levels of mortality, for example life 
expectancy and standardized mortality rates. Additional insights can be gained 
by using statistical distance metrics to examine differences in lifespan 
distributions between groups. Here, we use a distance metric, the non-overlap 
index, to capture the sociological concept of stratification, which emphasizes 
the emergence of unique, hierarchically layered social strata. We show an 
application using Finnish registration data that cover the entire population 
over the period from 1996 to 2017. The results indicate that lifespan 
stratification and life-expectancy differences between income groups both 
increased substantially from 1996 to 2008; subsequently, life-expectancy 
differences declined, whereas stratification stagnated for men and increased for 
women. We conclude that the non-overlap index uncovers a unique domain of 
inequalities in mortality and helps to capture important between-group 
differences that conventional approaches miss.
