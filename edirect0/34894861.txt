Background: The increase in life expectancy and in the number of individuals 
over 60 years old brings new demands to health professionals and services based 
on the physiological changes that occur in this population. The aging process 
results in changes in body composition, increasing body fat and reducing muscle 
mass, in addition to a reduction in bone mass. Aim: The aim of this study was to 
examine the effect of whey protein and vitamin D supplementation on body 
composition and skeletal muscle in older adults living in long-term care 
facilities. Methods: This study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. 
Thirty older adults (>60 years old) were randomized and allocated in three 
groups: group receiving resistance training and supplementation receiving 
resistance training, whey protein and vitamin D; group received resistance and 
placebo training receiving resistance training and placebo, and control group 
without any intervention. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. Results: The mean age was 
74.87 (± 8.14) years. A significant difference (p = 0.042) was observed between 
the group receiving resistance training and supplementation and control groups 
in relation to lean mass increase (kg) at 24 weeks. After 24 weeks of 
intervention, there was a significant increase in Relative index of muscle mass 
for the two groups that underwent resistance training, group received resistance 
and placebo training (p = 0.042) and group receiving resistance training and 
supplementation (p = 0.045), in relation to the control. Conclusion: Combined 
supplementation of whey protein and vitamin D with resistance training can 
significantly improve lean mass, total mass, and relative index of muscle mass 
in institutionalized older adults.
