BACKGROUND: A clinical trial proved the clinical effectiveness of perfusion 
imaging-guided intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase for patients with acute 
ischemic stroke (AIS) with the time of onset between 4.5 and 9 hours. This study 
aimed to assess the lifetime cost-effectiveness of alteplase versus placebo from 
the perspective of Chinese and United States (US) healthcare payers.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was built to estimate lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with alteplase or placebo. Model 
inputs were extracted from published sources. Incremental costs, incremental 
QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated to 
evaluate the base-case scenario. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
were performed to evaluate uncertainty in the results.
RESULTS: In China, alteplase yielded an additional lifetime QALY of 0.126 with 
an additional cost of Chinese Yuan (¥) ¥9552 compared with placebo, and the ICER 
was ¥83 950 (US$12 157)/QALY. In the US, alteplase had a higher QALY 
(difference: 0.193) with a lower cost (difference: US$-2024) compared with 
placebo. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, alteplase had a 42.54% to 78.3% 
probability of being cost-effective compared with placebo in China when the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold ranged from ¥72 447/QALY to ¥217 341/QALY. In 
the US, alteplase had a 93.47% to 93.57% probability of being cost-effective 
under the WTP threshold of US$100 000/QALY to US$150 000/QALY. These findings 
remained robust under one-way sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: For patients with AIS with a time of onset between 4.5 and 9 hours, 
perfusion imaging-guided intravenous alteplase was likely to be cost-effective 
in China and was cost-effective in the US when compared with placebo.
