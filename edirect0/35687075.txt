BACKGROUND: Extranodal extension (ENE) is an established prognostic factor in 
several gastrointestinal cancers. However, the prognostic impact remains 
unclear. Here, we investigated the prognostic implications of ENE in patients 
with surgically resected pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 476 surgically resected pancreatic head 
cancer patients who consecutively underwent upfront pancreaticoduodenectomy for 
pathologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma between January 2009 
and December 2013. We compared the disease-free survival (DFS) rates of the 
patients according to ENE status.
RESULTS: Among the 476 patients, patients with ENE had lower DFS rates than 
those without ENE (N0, 13 months; LN+/ENE-, 7 months; LN+/ENE+, 6 months; 
P < .001). In addition, even in the same N stage, patients with ENE had lower 
DFS rates than those without ENE (N0, 13 months; N1/ENE- 8 months; N1/ENE+, 
7 months; N2/ENE-, 7 months; N2/ENE+, 4 months, P < .001). However, there was no 
significant difference in survival rates between patients in the N1/ENE+ group 
and those in the N2/ENE- group. Additionally, ENE was an independent prognostic 
factor for pancreatic cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Extranodal extension significantly predicted a poor prognosis among 
patients with pancreatic head cancer, especially those with nodal metastasis. 
Therefore, ENE should be considered a prognostic factor in future editions of 
the staging system.
