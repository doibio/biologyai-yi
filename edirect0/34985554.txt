INTRODUCTION: Given the increase in life expectancy in the general population of 
our country, there is an exponential increase since the last decades of 
functional older adults who undergo total knee replacement (TKR). There is a 
direct relationship between the increase in age and the prevalence of both 
functional and cognitive disabling chronic diseases, however, little we know 
about whether age is an independent factor in predicting worse functional 
outcomes and readmissions after TKR. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
the clinical-functional results and unplanned readmissions within the first 90 
postoperative days in patients older than 80 years compared with a control group 
of patients younger than 80 years.
METHODS: From our institutional patient database, 450 patients who underwent TKR 
between 2016 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had the 
medical assurance of Hospital Italiano (Plan de Salud), for which none of these 
was lost on the follow-up nor were treated in another hospital. Patients were 
divided in two groups: Group A with 186 patients over 80 years and a control 
group B with 264 patients between 70 and 80 years. The fragility of these was 
defined according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the Simple Frail Score. 
Comorbidities were divided in eight groups to define which were the most 
influential in the final results.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in terms of unplanned 
readmissions, pain or in functional scores within 90 days between both groups. 
There was a significant difference in the length of postoperative hospital stay 
in favor of group A (A: 2.56 SD + - 0.76, B: 4.08 SD =  - 2.23; p = 0.00001). 
The Charlson score was higher in the group of patients older than 80 years 
(p = 0.02) as well as the Simple Frail Score (p = 0.004). The ASA score did not 
show significant differences between both groups.
CONCLUSION: Age as an independent factor proved not to be a predictor by itself 
of unplanned readmissions or worse clinical-functional results in a period of 90 
postoperative days between both groups. We believe that the preoperative 
evaluation of octogenarian patients should be multidisciplinary, with special 
attention to the identification of comorbidities that can influence the 
fragility of a patient and the optimization of the pathology.
