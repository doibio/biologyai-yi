BACKGROUND: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is an under-diagnosed disease presenting as 
a restrictive cardiomyopathy with high morbidity and mortality. Wild-type 
transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is mostly seen in elderly 
patients, with increasing prevalence as life expectancy is growing. New 
diagnostic imaging techniques and treatments allow for a better prognosis, but 
lack of clinical awareness delays timely diagnosis and appropriate management. 
Our purpose was to investigate the knowledge of clinicians regarding ATTR-CM and 
to assess the availability of imaging resources in the Latin-American region.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Two online surveys were distributed among clinicians and 
nuclear medicine professionals, respectively: one asking about awareness of CA 
in different clinical scenarios, and the other about the availability of 
diagnostic resources and studies performed. 406 responses were received for the 
first survey and 82 for the second, representing 17 and 14 countries, 
respectively. A significant lack of awareness was identified among clinicians, 
although appropriate diagnostic resources are generally available. Survey data 
showed that very few patients are evaluated for ATTR-CM in most Latin-American 
countries.
CONCLUSIONS: The surveys demonstrated the need for educational programs and 
other measures to increase clinical awareness and early detection of CA, so 
patients receive timely treatment and management of the disease.
