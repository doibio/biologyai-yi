INTRODUCTION: The aim of this review was to systematically evaluate the 
available evidence on the effectiveness of internet-based telerehabilitation 
among patients after total joint arthroplasty regarding pain, range of motion, 
physical function, health-related quality of life, satisfaction, and 
psychological well-being.
METHODS: This was a systematic review with meta-analysis based on the Cochrane 
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions guidelines. Studies published 
in English or Chinese were searched using defined search periods, databases, and 
search terms. Two reviewers assessed independently the quality of studies. 
RevMan 5.3 was used for meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Ï‡2 
and I2 statistic. A random effect model and mean difference (MD) with 95% 
confidence interval (CI) was adopted. Standardised mean difference (SMD) was 
used if the outcome was measured by different scales.
RESULTS: Eleven studies with 1020 participants were analysed. Compared to 
face-to-face rehabilitation, internet-based telerehabilitation showed no 
significant difference in outcomes of pain (SMD-0.11, 95% CI-0.32 to 0.10), 
range of motion in flexion (MD 0.65, 95% CI-1.18 to 2.48) and extension 
(MD-0.38, 95% CI-1.16 to 0.40), patient-reported physical function (SMD 0.01, 
95% CI-0.15 to 0.17), health-related quality of life (SMD-0.09, 95% CI-0.26 to 
0.07), satisfaction (SMD-0.04, 95% CI-0.21 to 0.14), and psychological 
well-being (SMD 0.10, 95% CI-0.13 to 0.33). Internet-based telerehabilitation 
showed better outcomes in physical functional tests (SMD-0.54, 95% CI-1.08 
to-0.01).
DISCUSSION: This review suggests that internet-based telerehabilitation has 
comparable effectiveness to face-to-face rehabilitation on rehabilitation 
outcomes among patients after total joint arthroplasty.
