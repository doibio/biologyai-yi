Most illnesses and deaths in industry workers are associated with occupational 
diseases (ODs). In recent years, mining has grown rapidly into a major driver of 
the Mongolian economy. In this study, the organization-based registry data on OD 
incidence and mortality from the archival data of the 'Erdenet' Copper and 
Molybdenum Concentrator Plant in Mongolia were used. We estimated the ODs burden 
in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) loss between 1999 and 2019. A total of 
72,802 DALYs were lost over 20â€‰years, of which 97.5% were due to years lived 
with disability and 2.5% for years of life lost. The disease burden was high in 
men, accounting for 76.8% of total DALY. In terms of age groups, among people 
aged 46-55, DALY accounted for the largest percentage of losses. We found that 
workplace dust, noise, ergonomics, and vibration were the main factors 
attributed to the DALYs during the past two decades.
