Radiation plexitis, also known as radiation-induced brachial neuropathy is a 
rare toxicity following axillary, breast, cervical or thoracic radiotherapy, 
first described in 1966 by Stoll and Andrew. Although improvements in 
radiotherapy techniques have greatly reduced its risk over the past seventy 
years, its severe form remains a dreaded complication that is difficult to 
manage in patients with increased life expectancy. This article summarizes the 
epidemiological elements, risk factors, diagnostic methods, doses and 
constraints to be respected in radiotherapy and the treatment strategies of 
radiation plexitis.
