BACKGROUND: Although biological aging has been proposed as a more accurate 
measure of aging, few biological aging measures have been developed for Asians, 
especially for young adults.
METHODS: A total of 521 656 participants were enrolled in the MJ cohort 
(1996-2011) and were followed until death, loss-to-follow-up, or December 31, 
2011, whichever came first. We selected 14 clinical biomarkers, including 
chronological age, using a random forest algorithm, and developed a 
multidimensional aging measure (MDAge). Model performance was assessed by area 
under the curve (AUC) and internal calibration. We evaluated the associations of 
MDAge and residuals from regressing MDAge on chronological age (MDAgeAccel) with 
mortality and morbidity, and assessed the robustness of our findings.
RESULTS: MDAge achieved an excellent AUC of 0.892 in predicting all-cause 
mortality (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.889-0.894). Participants with higher 
MDAge at baseline were at a higher risk of death (per 5 years, hazard ration 
[HR] = 1.671, 95% CI: 1.662-1.680), and the association remained after 
controlling for other variables and in different subgroups. Furthermore, 
participants with higher MDAgeAccel were associated with shortened life 
expectancy. For instance, compared to men who were biologically younger 
(MDAgeAccel ≤ 0) at baseline, men in the highest tertiles of MDAgeAccel had 
shortened life expectancy by 17.23 years. In addition, higher MDAgeAccel was 
associated with having chronic disease either cross-sectionally (per 1-standard 
deviation [SD], odds ratio [OR] = 1.564, 95% CI: 1.552-1.575) or longitudinally 
(per 1-SD, OR = 1.218, 95% CI: 1.199-1.238).
CONCLUSION: MDAge accurately predicted mortality and morbidity, which has great 
potential in the early identification of individuals at higher risk and 
therefore promoting early intervention.
