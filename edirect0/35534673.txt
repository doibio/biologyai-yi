PURPOSE: As life expectancy for HIV patients improve, hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) has become a non-AIDS defining illness with a high impact on morbidity and 
mortality of HIV-infected individuals. We sought to compare outcomes in HIV- 
versus non-HIV-infected patients treated for HCC at a multiethnic academic 
medical health system.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with HCC from 
1/1/2005 to 12/31/2016 was performed. Differences in characteristics among HIV 
and non-HIV subjects were assessed. Associations between HIV status, viral load, 
CD4 count, and overall survival (OS) were also assessed.
RESULTS: We identified 915 subjects (842 non-HIV and 73 with HIV). HIV-infected 
subjects were younger, predominantly male non-Hispanic Blacks, and more likely 
to have HBV and HCV co-infection, and alcohol use at diagnosis compared to 
non-HIV counterparts. Stage, MELD score, Child-Pugh, and ECOG performance status 
were similar. HIV-positive patients received systemic therapy at significantly 
higher rates and liver transplantation for HCC at significantly lower rates than 
those without HIV. The actuarial 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) for all 
patients was 48.3% and 39.4%. For HIV-infected subjects, 3- and 5-year OS was 
significantly worse at 36.8% and 28.3% compared to 49.3% and 40.4%, 
respectively, for non-HIV subjects (log rank p = 0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected HCC patients have lower survival rates compared to 
those without HIV. Despite younger age and similar stage, MELD, and ECOG at 
diagnosis, HIV portends worse outcomes in patients with HCC.
