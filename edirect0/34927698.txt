BACKGROUND: The number of deaths among people with coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) does not show the true impact of the disease on communities. 
Therefore, this study aimed to calculate years of life lost (YLL) due to 
premature death in patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: We performed a descriptive cross-sectional study based on data from one 
of the largest provinces of Iran, in the period 13 February 2020 to 17 May 2021. 
We used WHO proposed guidelines for the calculation of the burden of diseases to 
calculate the YLL among patients with COVID-19, taking into consideration gender 
in different age groups.
RESULTS: Findings showed that 13 628 deaths were due to COVID-19 with associated 
249 309 YLL. The study reported higher mortality among men (1222 cases) in the 
age group over 85 years than in women (840) of the same age group. The minimum 
number of YLL for men was 1749 in the 5-9 years age group and that for women was 
1551 years in the 14-10 years age group.
CONCLUSION: The high number of deaths due to COVID-19 has led to high YLL due to 
premature death. The provision of adequate health care and appropriate policies 
will bring about a decrease in YLL due to COVID-19.
