OBJECTIVE: Assess cost-effectiveness and -utility associated with posttransplant 
HCC surveillance compared to standard follow-up.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite lack of prospective clinical data, expert 
consensus recommends posttransplant surveillance to detect HCC recurrence in a 
latent phase, while it might be amenable to curative-intent therapy.
METHODS: A Markov-based transition model was created to estimate life expectancy 
and quality-of-life among liver transplant patients undergoing HCC surveillance. 
Models were built for 2 cohorts: 1 undergoing HCC surveillance with 
contrast-enhanced computed tomography of chest and abdomen and serum 
alpha-fetoprotein analysis and the other receiving standard posttransplant 
follow-up. Primary model outputs included LY and QALY gains, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, and incremental cost-utility ratio. Willingness-to-pay 
for a QALY gain (cost-effectiveness threshold) was used to estimate efficiency.
RESULTS: Surveillance was marginally more effective versus no surveillance, 
resulting in means of 0.069 LYs and 0.026 QALYs gained. Costs for surveillance 
were increased by an average of 988.32€, resulting in incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio 14,410.15€/LY and incremental cost-utility ratio 
37,547.97€/QALY. Surveillance did not seem cost-effective in our setting, 
considering willingness-to-pay threshold of 25,000€/QALY. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis indicated surveillance might be cost-effective in 42% of 
cases, but degree of uncertainty in the analysis was high.
CONCLUSIONS: Performing posttransplant HCC surveillance offers marginal clinical 
benefits and increases costs. Although expert consensus supports surveillance, 
results of this decision analysis raise doubt regarding the utility of such 
recommendations and support ongoing need for prospective clinical trials.
