PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of annual renal imaging 
surveillance (RIS) in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). 
HLRCC is associated with a 21% risk to age 70 years of RCC. Presentations with 
advanced renal cell cancer (RCC) are associated with poor outcomes whereas RIS 
detects early-stage RCC; however, evidence for the cost-effectiveness of RIS is 
lacking.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare, at different age 
starting points (11 years, 18 years, 40 years, 60 years), the costs and benefits 
of lifetime contrast-enhanced renal MRI surveillance (CERMRIS) vs no 
surveillance in HLRCC. Benefits were measured in life-years gained (LYG), 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs in British Pounds Sterling (GBP). 
Net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated using a cost-effectiveness threshold 
of £20 000/QALY. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were also 
performed.
RESULTS: In the base-case 11-year age cohort, surveillance was cost-effective 
(Incremental_NMB=£3522 (95% CI -£2747 to £7652); Incremental_LYG=1.25 (95% CI 
0.30 to 1.86); Incremental_QALYs=0.29 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.43)] at an additional 
mean discounted cost of £2185/patient (95% CI £430 to £4144). Surveillance was 
also cost-effective in other age cohorts and dominated a no surveillance 
strategy in the 40 year cohort [Incremental_NMB=£12 655 (95% CIs -£709 to £21 
134); Incremental_LYG=1.52 (95% CI 0.30 to 2.26); Incremental_QALYs=0.58 (95% CI 
0.12 to 0.87) with a cost saving of £965/patient (95% CI -£4202 to £2652).
CONCLUSION: Annual CERMRI in HLRCC is cost-effective across age groups modelled.
