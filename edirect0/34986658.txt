BACKGROUND AND AIMS: My Diabetes My Way (MDMW) is Scotland's interactive website 
and mobile app for people with diabetes and their caregivers. It contains 
multimedia resources for diabetes education and offers access to electronic 
personal health records. This study aims to assess the cost-utility of MDMW 
compared with routine diabetes care in people with type 2 diabetes who do not 
use insulin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis used the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes 
Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model 2. Clinical parameters of MDMW users (n = 2576) 
were compared with a matched cohort of individuals receiving routine care alone 
(n = 11 628). Matching criteria: age, diabetes duration, sex, and socioeconomic 
status. Impact on life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
costs of treatment and complications were simulated over ten years, including a 
10% sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: MDMW cohort: 1670 (64.8%) men; average age 64.3 years; duration of 
diabetes 5.5 years. 906 (35.2%) women: average age 61.6 years; duration 4.7 
years. The cumulative mean QALY (95% CI) gain: 0.054 (0.044-0.062) years. Mean 
difference in cost: -£118.72 (-£150.16 to -£54.16) over ten years. Increasing 
MDMW costs (10%): -£50.49 (-£82.24-£14.14). Decreasing MDMW costs (10%): 
-£186.95 (-£218.53 to -£122.51).
CONCLUSIONS: MDMW is "dominant" over usual care (cost-saving and life improving) 
in supporting self-management in people with type 2 diabetes not treated with 
insulin. Wider use may result in significant cost savings through delay or 
reduction of long-term complications and improved QALYs in Scotland and other 
countries. MDMW may be among the most cost-effective interventions currently 
available to support diabetes.
