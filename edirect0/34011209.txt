AIM: One approach to measure the demographic impacts of death is to examine the 
number of lost years of life. The present paper aims to estimate the "Years of 
Lost Life" (YLL) due to the main causes of death in Yazd province of Iran.
METHOD: The present study is an epidemiological examination for which the 
statistical population included all the death incidents in Yazd province 
(excluding stillbirth cases) over two time periods of 2011 and 2016 with a 
5-year distance. The required data were obtained based on the Comprehensive 
System of Mortality Registration maintained by the Ministry of Health and 
Medical Education; while the standard life expectancy data were based on the 
World Health Organization standards using standard life table, level 26 of the 
West model (Coale and Demeny) for Japanese men and women. The standard YLL was 
calculated according to the WHO standard using a 0.03 relaxation rate for the 
future time and weighting coefficient for various ages and life years through 
the formula using the Microsoft Excel software.
RESULTS: The findings of the present study suggest that two main causes of YLL 
in Yazd province during the year of 2011 were cardiovascular difficulties with 
the rates of 31.6 per 1000 persons for women and 27.1 per 1000 persons for men, 
and cancers with the rates of 14.9 per 1000 persons for women and 16.2 per 1000 
persons for men. While the above numbers in 2016 were, respectively 22.5 per 
1000 persons for women and 25.5 per 1000 persons for men due to cardiovascular 
difficulties; and 18 per 1000 persons for women and 15.5/1000 for men due to 
various types of cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cardiovascular diseases and cancers are 
the main factors leading to Years of Lost Lifetime for the residents of Yazd 
province in Iran.
