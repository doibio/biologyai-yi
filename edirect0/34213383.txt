Recent estimates have reiterated that non-fatal causes of disease, such as low 
back pain, headaches and depressive disorders, are amongst the leading causes of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). For these causes, the contribution of 
years lived with disability (YLD) - put simply, ill-health - is what drives 
DALYs, not mortality. Being able to monitor trends in YLD closely is 
particularly relevant for countries that sit high on the socio-demographic 
spectrum of development, as it contributes more than half of all DALYs. There is 
a paucity of data on how the population-level occurrence of disease is 
distributed according to severity, and as such, the majority of global and 
national efforts in monitoring YLD lack the ability to differentiate changes in 
severity across time and location. This raises uncertainties in interpreting 
these findings without triangulation with other relevant data sources. Our 
commentary aims to bring this issue to the forefront for users of burden of 
disease estimates, as its impact is often easily overlooked as part of the 
fundamental process of generating DALY estimates. Moreover, the wider health 
harms of the COVID-19 pandemic have underlined the likelihood of latent and 
delayed demand in accessing vital health and care services that will ultimately 
lead to exacerbated disease severity and health outcomes. This places increased 
importance on attempts to be able to differentiate by both the occurrence and 
severity of disease.
