This review article depicts the possible replacement of staple cereal sources 
with some pseudocereals like Chia, Quinoa, Buckwheat, and Amaranth, which not 
only provide recommended daily allowance of all nutrients but also help to 
reduce the chances of many non-communicable infections owing to the presence of 
several bioactive compounds. These pseudocereals are neglected plant seeds and 
should be added in our routine diet. Besides, they can serve as nutraceuticals 
in combating various diseases by improving the health status of the consumers. 
The bioactive compounds like rutin, quercetin, peptide chains, angiotensin I, 
and many other antioxidants present in these plant seeds help to reduce the 
oxidative stress in the body which leads toward better health of the consumers. 
All these pseudocereals have high quantity of soluble fiber which helps to 
regulate bowel movement, control hypercholesterolemia (presence of high plasma 
cholesterol levels), hypertension (high blood pressure), and cardiovascular 
diseases. The ultimate result of consumption of pseudocereals either as a whole 
or in combination with true cereals as staple food may help to retain the 
integrity of the human body which increases the life expectancy by slowing down 
the aging process.
