Fructose 1-phosphate aldolase deficiency or hereditary fruc­tose intol­er­ance 
(HFI) is an auto­so­mal reces­sive dis­order, caused by the deficiency in 
aldolase B (fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase), an enzyme responsible for the 
cleavage of fructose-1-phosphate. HFI is a metabolic disorder that usually 
manifests around 4-6 months of age when weaning is started. The inheritance 
pattern is autosomal recessive, and there is a 25% chance of having a child with 
HFI if both parents are heterozygotes. The mainstay of treatment is the dietary 
restriction of fructose, sorbitol, and sucrose. Life expectancy is normal in 
these individuals if appropriate precautionary measures are taken. The disorder 
leads to a toxic accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in the liver and renal 
tubules.
