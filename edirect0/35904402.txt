BACKGROUND: Nursing home (NH) residents seek care at dental offices, yet many of 
them are at the end of life. The uncertain life expectancy further complicates 
the care of NH residents. This study aimed to develop and validate a Nursing 
Home Mortality Index (NHMI) to identify NH residents in the last year of life.
METHODS: Logistic modeling was used to develop predictive models for death 
within 1 year after initial appointment by utilizing the new patient examination 
data and mortality data of 903 Minnesota NH residents. The final model was 
selected based on areas under the curve (AUC) and then validated using data from 
586 Iowa NH residents. Based on the final model, the NHMI was developed with the 
estimated 1-year mortality for the low, medium and high risk group.
RESULTS: One-year mortalities were 21% and 26% in the development and validation 
cohorts, respectively. Predictors included age, gender, communication capacity, 
physical mobility, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, 
cancer, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal disease and liver disease. AUCs 
for the development and validation models were 0.73 and 0.68, respectively. For 
the validation cohort, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.79 and 0.53, 
respectively. The estimated 1-year mortality risks for three risk groups were 
0%-10%, 11%-19%, and ≥20%, respectively CONCLUSION: The high mortality rate of 
NH residents following a dental exam highlighted a need to incorporate patients' 
prognoses in treatment planning along with normative needs and patients' 
preferences. The NHMI provides a practical way to guide treatment decisions for 
end-of-life NH residents.
