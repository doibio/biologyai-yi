PURPOSE: Quadriceps tendon ruptures (QTR) occur predominantly in middle-aged 
patients through violent eccentric contraction that occurs either when trying to 
regain balance or during a fall on the hyperflexed knee. The aim of this study 
was to quantify midterm postoperative results, including strength potential 
measured via standardized strength tests following acute (< six weeks) 
quadriceps tendon refixation using suture anchors.
METHODS: All consecutive patients with QTR who underwent surgical suture anchor 
refixation between 2012 and 2019 at a single institution with a minimum 
follow-up of 12 months were retrospectively evaluated. Outcome measures included 
Tegner Activity Scale (TAS), Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation 
Committee subjective knee form (IKDC), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score (KOOS) subscales, return to work rates, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for 
pain. Additionally, a standardized clinical examination and an isometric 
strength assessment of knee extension and flexion were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 17 patients (median age 61.0 [25-75% IQR 50.5-72.5]) were 
available for final assessment at a mean follow-up of 47.1 ± SD 25.4 months. The 
majority of patients were male (82.4%) and most injuries occurred due to a fall 
on the hyperflexed knee (76.5%). The average time interval between trauma and 
surgery was 12.7 ± 7.5 days. Patients achieved a moderate level of activity 
postoperatively with a median TAS of 4 (3-5.5) and reported good to excellent 
outcome scores (Lysholm score: 97 (86.5-100); IKDC: 80.7 ± 13.5; KOOS subscales: 
pain 97.2 (93.1-100), symptoms 92.9 (82.5-100), activities of daily living 97.1 
(93.4-100), sport and recreation function 80 (40-97.5) and knee-related quality 
of life 87.5 (62.5-100). All patients were able to fully return to work and 
reported little pain [VAS: 0 (0-0)]. No postoperative complications were 
reported. Strength measurements revealed a significant deficit of knee extension 
strength in comparison to the contralateral side (p = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: Suture anchor refixation of acute QTR leads to good functional 
results and high patient satisfaction without major complications. Isometric 
knee extension strength, however, may not be fully restored compared to the 
unaffected side.
