With growing life expectancy, the prevalence of frailty and sarcopenia will 
continuously increase during the next decades. Geographical differences have 
been described, and depending on the population studied, sarcopenia is evident 
in 10% of community-dwelling people, increasing up to 40 to 50% among those 
living in nursing homes. Sarcopenia is a complex age-related process of 
multifactorial pathogenesis, influenced by lifestyle, nutrition, biological 
processes during aging, and also immunological and endocrine mechanisms. For 
diagnostic criteria, physical parameters (muscle mass measurement) and 
functional aspects (muscle strength, gait speed, physical performance) are 
required. In routine clinical care, screening patients using the SARC‑F 
questionnaire is recommended by recent guidelines of the European Workgroup for 
Sarcopenia.
