The United States is releasing more individuals from prisons than ever before. 
However, returning citizens face numerous challenges transitioning back into 
community life and many communities remain ill-equipped in successfully 
supporting them. This study focuses on transportation as in integral component 
to the success of returning citizens. Rapid and rigorous qualitative data 
analysis (RADaR technique) is applied to interviews (n = 15) with individuals 
having returned to their community about the impact of transportation on their 
reentry. Analysis resulted in three primary themes; interviewees reinforced 
existing knowledge of the issues with transportation disadvantage, 
transportation is an extension of freedom, and transportation is directly 
connected to reentry success. These findings suggest a tiered structure of 
transportation freedom for returning citizens. This model of transportation will 
aid future researchers and policymakers in considering how to better resource 
returning citizens to maximize their success.
