OBJECTIVES: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England has 
implemented severity-of-disease modifiers that give greater weight to health 
benefits accruing to patients who experience a larger shortfall in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) under current standard of care than healthy 
individuals. This requires an estimate of quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE) of the general population based on age and sex. Previous QALE population 
norms are based on nearly 30-year-old assessments of health-related quality of 
life in the general population. This study provides updated QALE estimates for 
the English population based on age and sex.
METHODS: 5-level version of EQ-5D data for 14 412 participants from the Health 
Survey for England (waves 2017 and 2018) were pooled, and health-related quality 
of life population norms were calculated. These norms were combined with 
official life tables from the Office for National Statistics for 2017 to 2019 
using the Sullivan method to derive QALE estimates based on age and sex. Values 
were discounted using 0%, 1.5%, and 3.5% discount rates.
RESULTS: QALE at birth is 68.24 QALYs for men and 68.21 QALYs for women. These 
values are significantly lower than previously published QALE population norms 
based on the older 3-level version of EQ-5D data.
CONCLUSION: This study provides new QALE population norms for England that serve 
to establish absolute and relative QALY shortfalls for the purpose of health 
technology assessments.
