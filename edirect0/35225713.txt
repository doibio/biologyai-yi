The value of psychotherapy in surgical patients suffering from postoperative 
delirium is unclear. Options for the treatment of established postoperative 
delirium are few; therapy largely relies on the avoidance of postoperative 
delirium facilitating factors, like specific drugs and environmental factors in 
the perioperative setting. Established medical therapies' efficacy in terms of 
decreasing incidence of postoperative delirium is very low. The aim of this 
project is to suggest new therapeutic options in the form of cognitive 
behavioural therapy as a possible preventive and psychotherapeutic treatment of 
postoperative delirium. Life expectancy in developed countries increases 
worldwide and both the need for surgical treatment and the probability of 
postoperative delirium occurrence increase with age. Due to the necessity of 
addressing the individual's negative consequences of postoperative delirium and 
to optimise socioeconomical needs, new therapeutic options for the treatment of 
postoperative delirium are desperately needed.
