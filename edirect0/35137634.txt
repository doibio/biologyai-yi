Social connection is important across the life course, but overall levels have 
been declining. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique context to examine 
social connectedness and adaptive capacity in times of social adversity. We used 
a parallel mixed method design to collect online survey data from a 
representative U.S. sample (N  =  359). Applying an exploratory sequential 
approach, we used a general linear model multivariate approach to repeated 
measures to test for differences in participants' perceptions of social 
connectedness by time and age category and qualitative analysis to gain insights 
about disrupted social contexts. Results indicated that social connectedness 
decreased after mitigation restrictions for all age groups, but individuals in 
emerging and late adulthood felt the greatest impact. Two themes emerged: 
differing emotional responses to altered communication and intentionality of 
maintaining and/or creating social connections. Experiences of social 
connectedness need to be understood as a function of life stage and 
developmental timing.
