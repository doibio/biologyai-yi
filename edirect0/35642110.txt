Cardiotoxicity from chemotherapy regimens has been long reported. However, the 
understanding of cardiac side effects of biological therapies is rapidly 
evolving. With cancer patients achieving higher life expectancy due to the use 
of personalized medicine and novel targeted anticancer agents, the occurrence of 
cardiotoxicity is becoming more significant. Novel biological therapies include 
anti-HER2 antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, bruton kinase inhibitors, 
antivascular endothelial growth factors, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulator 
drugs, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Potential cardiovascular toxicities 
linked to these anticancer agents include hypertension, arrhythmias, QT 
prolongation, myocardial ischemia and infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, 
congestive heart failure, and thromboembolism. Cardiac biomarkers, 
electrocardiography, echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging are common 
diagnostic modalities used for early detection of these complications and timely 
intervention. This review discusses the various types of cardiotoxicities caused 
by novel anticancer biologic agents, their molecular and pathophysiological 
mechanisms, risk factors, and diagnostic and management strategies that can be 
used to prevent, minimize, and treat them.
