PURPOSE: To present 3 cases of oncologic pain treated by DREZotomy in the 
pediatric population and to review the literature published about this 
procedure.
METHODS: The permanent literature about oncologic pain treatment in children and 
the applicability of DREZotomy was reviewed. Three cases treated at our 
institution were reviewed and presented.
RESULTS: In the pediatric population, the DREZotomy has been extensively applied 
for the treatment of spasticity and spasticity-related pain. Currently, there 
are no reports of oncologic pain treated by means of a DREZotomy in children. We 
presented 3 cases coursing the terminal stage of illness, presenting 
predominantly neuropathic, oncologic pain that were successfully managed after a 
DREZotomy was performed.
CONCLUSION: In well-selected patients, with a good general condition and life 
expectancy to withstand an open neurosurgical procedure, DREZotomy is an 
excellent tool to treat neuropathic oncologic pain.
