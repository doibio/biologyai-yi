OBJECTIVE: Thyroid cancer has been an increasingly high-profile public health 
issue. Comprehensive assessment for its disease burden seems particularly 
important for understanding health priorities and hinting high-risk populations.
METHODS: We estimated the age-sex-specific thyroid cancer burden and its 
temporal trend in China from 1990 to 2019 by following the general methods from 
the global burden of disease (GBDs) 2019 Study. And Joinpoint regression model, 
the Cox-Stuart trend test, and Cochran-Armitage test were applied for the 
analysis of temporal and age trend. The Mantel-Haenszel statistical method was 
used to compare the gender difference.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate of thyroid 
cancer in China has almost doubled to 2.05 per 100,000. Although the mortality 
rate and DALY rate kept leveling off, they presented a downtrend among females, 
while an upward trend in males. While the average annual percentage changes of 
those metrics all became deline since 2010 than the previous years. With age 
advancing, the rates of incidence, mortality, and DALYs for both sexes all 
presented linear fashion increases, which was particularly typical among males.
CONCLUSION: Given the serious trend and gender-age heterogeneity of Chinese 
thyroid cancer burden, male gender and advanced age may be related to poor 
prognosis of thyroid cancer, and strengthening primary prevention and exploring 
the underlying risk factors should be among the top priorities.
