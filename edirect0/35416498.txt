INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Long-term durability and functional outcome of 
laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy (LSH) remains to be confirmed. We set out to 
assess the development of surgical outcome in women with increasing minimal 
follow-up.
METHODS: All women after LSH with anterior and posterior mesh extension operated 
for advanced apical uterine prolapse at Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire clinic from July 
2005 to June 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Last known 
follow-up information was used for the analysis and allocation into groups. The 
surgical success was defined as no prolapse beyond hymen, no symptomatic 
recurrence or no retreatment. Functional outcome was evaluated from validated 
questionnaires and presence of pelvic floor disorders. The outcomes were 
compared with preoperative state using chi-square and Fisher's test; p < 0.05 
was considered significant.
RESULTS: In total, 270 patients after LSH with a follow-up of up to 14.5 years 
were enrolled and divided into groups according to their last follow-up length: 
≥ 1 year 242, ≥ 3 years 112, ≥ 5 years 76, ≥ 7 years 45 and ≥ 10 years 18 women. 
Increase of minimal follow-up was associated with gradual decrease in surgical 
success. Rates of stress urinary incontinence were unchanged by the surgery, 
while anal incontinence and constipation rates decreased significantly; 14.5% of 
women were operated on for SUI in the follow-up. The PFDI-20, PFIQ-7 and VAS 
bother scores decreased significantly regardless of minimal follow-up length.
CONCLUSIONS: LSH with anterior and posterior mesh extension is a safe, effective 
and durable surgery with a positive long-term effect on quality of life. 
Although the surgical success gradually decreases, LSH remains a surgical 
success in most women.
