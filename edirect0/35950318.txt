BACKGROUND: Long-term preventive treatment such as treatment with statins should 
be reassessed among patients approaching end of life. The aim of the study was 
to describe the rate of discontinuation of statin treatment and factors 
associated with discontinuation in the 6 months before death.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective cohort study using national registers and 
blood test results from primary health care patients. Patients in the Copenhagen 
municipality, Denmark who died between 1997 and 2018 and were statin users 
during the 10-year period before death were included. We calculated the 
proportion who remained statin users in the 6-month period before death. Factors 
associated with discontinuation were tested using logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 55,591 decedents were included. More patients continued 
treatment (64%, n = 35,693) than discontinued (36%, n = 19,898) the last 6 
months of life. The 70 and 80 age groups had the lowest odds of discontinuing 
compared to the 90 (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.93-2.72) and 100 (OR 3.11, 95% CI 
2.79-3.47) age groups. Increasing comorbidity score (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.87; 0.90 
per 1-point increase) and use of statins for secondary prevention (OR 0.89, 95% 
CI 0.85; 0.93) reduced the likelihood of discontinuation as did a diagnosis of 
dementia, heart failure, or cancer.
CONCLUSION: A substantial portion of patients continued statin treatment near 
end of life. Efforts to promote rational statin use and discontinuation are 
required among patients with limited life expectancy, including establishing 
clear, practical recommendations about statin discontinuation, and initiatives 
to translate recommendations into clinical practice.
