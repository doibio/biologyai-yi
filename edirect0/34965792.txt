BACKGROUND: In an aging society with increasing old age life expectancy, it has 
become increasingly important to monitor the health development in the 
population. This paper combines information on mortality and disability and 
explores educational inequalities in disability-free life expectancy in the 
aging population in Sweden, and to what extent these inequalities have increased 
or decreased over time.
METHODS: A random sample of the Swedish population aged 77 years and above 
(n=2895) provided information about disability in the population in the years 
2002, 2004, 2011 and 2014. The prevalence of disability was assessed by five 
items of personal activities of daily living and incorporated in period life 
tables for the corresponding years, using the Sullivan method. The analyses were 
stratified by sex and educational attainment. Estimates at ages 77 and 85 years 
are presented.
RESULTS: Disability-free life expectancy at age 77 years increased more than 
total life expectancy for all except men with lower education. Women with higher 
education had a 2.7-year increase and women with lower education a 1.6-year 
increase. The corresponding numbers for men were 2.0 and 0.8 years. The 
educational gap in disability-free life expectancy increased by 1.2 years at age 
77 years for both men and women.
CONCLUSIONS: While most of the increase in life expectancy was years free from 
disability, men with lower education had an increase of years with disability. 
The educational differences prevailed and increased over the period as the gains 
in disability-free life expectancy were smaller among those with lower 
education.
