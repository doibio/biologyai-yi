BACKGROUND: Desired longevity represents how strongly people esteem possible 
extensions of their own lifetime. The association between desired longevity and 
mortality risk has been reported in only one prospective study, which examined a 
small sample of older participants. We aimed to examine the hypothesis that 
desired longevity at middle-age predicted long-term survival.
METHODS: In the prospective cohort study, residents aged 40-64 years were asked 
how long they would like to live and asked to choose one from three options: 
longer than, as long as, or shorter than the life expectancy. We used Cox 
proportional hazards model to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality according 
to the three groups for desired longevity, treating the "longer than" group as 
the reference. We conducted mediation analysis to investigate the mechanism for 
the association between desired longevity and mortality.
RESULTS: We recruited 39,902 residents to the study. Risk of all-cause mortality 
was significantly higher in the "shorter than" group (HR 1.12; 95% CI, 
1.04-1.21). The association was independent of sex, age, marital status, 
education, medical history, and health status. Regarding cause of death, 
mortality risk of cancer (HR 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.29) and suicide (HR 2.15; 95% 
CI, 1.37-3.38) were also higher in the "shorter than" group. The unhealthy 
lifestyle mediated this association with all-cause mortality by 30.4%.
CONCLUSION: Shorter desired longevity was significantly associated with an 
increased risk of all-cause mortality, and mortality from cancer and suicide. 
Lifestyle behaviors particularly mediated this association.
