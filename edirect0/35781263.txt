Fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, possesses eight hexose transporters, 
Ght1~8. In order to clarify the role of each hexose transporter on glucose 
uptake, a glucose uptake assay system was established and the actual glucose 
uptake activity of each hexose transporter-deletion mutant was measured. Under 
normal growth condition containing 2% glucose, ∆ght5 and ∆ght2 mutants showed 
large and small decrease in glucose uptake activity, respectively. On the other 
hand, the other deletion mutants did not show any decrease in glucose uptake 
activity indicating that, in the presence of Ght5 and Ght2, the other hexose 
transporters do not play a significant role in glucose uptake. To understand the 
relevance between glucose uptake and lifespan regulation, we measured the 
chronological lifespan of each hexose transporter deletion mutant, and found 
that only ∆ght5 mutant showed a significant lifespan extension. Based on these 
results we showed that Ght5 is mainly involved in the glucose uptake in 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and suggested that the ∆ght5 mutant has prolonged 
lifespan due to physiological changes similar to calorie restriction.
