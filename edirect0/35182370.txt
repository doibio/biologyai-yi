PURPOSE: To test the effect of race/ethnicity on Social Security Administration 
(SSA) life tables' life expectancy (LE) predictions in localized prostate cancer 
(PCa) patients treated with either radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam 
radiotherapy (EBRT). We hypothesized that LE will be affected by race/ethnicity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We relied on the 2004-2006 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results database to identify D'Amico intermediate- and high-risk PCa 
patients treated with either RP or EBRT. SSA life tables were used to compute 
10-year LE predictions and were compared to OS. Stratification was performed 
according to treatment type (RP/EBRT) and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, 
non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian).
RESULTS: Of 55,383 assessable patients, 40,490 were non-Hispanic White (RP 49.3% 
vs. EBRT 50.7%), 7194 non-Hispanic Black (RP 41.3% vs. EBRT 50.7%), 4716 
Hispanic/Latino (RP 51.0% vs. EBRT 49.0%) and 2983 were Asian (RP 41.6% vs. EBRT 
58.4%). In both RP and EBRT patients, OS exceeded life tables' LE predictions, 
except for non-Hispanic Blacks. However, in RP patients, the magnitude of the 
difference was greater than in EBRT. Moreover, in RP patients, OS of 
non-Hispanic Blacks virtually perfectly followed predicted LE. Conversely, in 
EBRT patients, the OS of non-Hispanic Black patients was worse than predicted 
LE.
CONCLUSIONS: When comparing SEER-derived observed OS with SSA life table-derived 
predicted life expectancy, we recorded a survival disadvantage in non-Hispanic 
Black RP and EBRT patients, which was not the case in the three other 
races/ethnicities (non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic/Latinos, and Asians). This 
discrepancy should ideally be confirmed within different registries, countries, 
and tumor entities. Furthermore, the source of these discrepant survival 
outcomes should be investigated and addressed by health care politics.
