Black Americans have the lowest life expectancy and health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL; a strong predictor of premature mortality) of any racial/ethnic 
group in the United States. Low rates of physical activity and engagement in 
healthy eating are two known contributors to low HRQoL. Black Americans are more 
likely to live in environments that inhibit engagement in these two 
contributors. The present study examined sense of community as a buffer against 
the adverse effects of low physical activity and healthy eating on HRQoL among 
Black Americans. A sample of 290 Black American adults were recruited for the 
present study. Results indicate that sense of community buffers against the 
adverse effects of low physical activity on HRQoL. The results of the present 
study can be used by health promotion interventionists and policy-makers to 
improve HRQoL and reduce premature mortality among Black Americans.
