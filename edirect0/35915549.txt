BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol consumption increased in the early phases of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and risky 
drinking are linked to harmful health effects. This paper aimed to project 
future health and cost impacts of shifts in alcohol consumption during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
DESIGN: An individual-level simulation model of the long-term drinking patterns 
for people with life-time AUD was used to simulate 10 000 individuals and 
project model outcomes to the estimated 25.9 million current drinkers with 
life-time AUD in the United States. The model considered three scenarios: (1) no 
change (counterfactual for comparison); (2) increased drinking levels persist 
for 1 year ('increase-1') and (3) increased drinking levels persist for 5 years 
('increase-5').
SETTING: United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Current drinkers with life-time AUD.
MEASUREMENTS: Life expectancy [life-years (LYs)], quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), alcohol-related hospitalizations and associated hospitalization costs 
and alcohol-related deaths, during a 5-year period.
FINDINGS: Short-term increases in alcohol consumption (increase-1 scenario) 
resulted in a loss of 79 000 [95% uncertainty interval (UI]) 26 000-201 000] 
LYs, a loss of 332 000 (104 000-604 000) QALYs and 295 000 (82 000-501 000) more 
alcohol-related hospitalizations, costing an additional $5.4 billion ($1.5-9.3 
billion) over 5 years. Hospitalizations for cirrhosis of the liver accounted for 
approximately $3.0 billion ($0.9-4.8 billion) in hospitalization costs, more 
than half the increase across all alcohol-related conditions. Health and cost 
impacts were more pronounced for older age groups (51+), women and non-Hispanic 
black individuals. Increasing the duration of pandemic-driven increases in 
alcohol consumption in the increase-5 scenario resulted in larger impacts.
CONCLUSIONS: Simulations show that if the increase in alcohol consumption 
observed in the United States in the first year of the pandemic continues, 
alcohol-related mortality, morbidity and associated costs will increase 
substantially over the next 5 years.
