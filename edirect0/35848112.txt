Studies of the relationship between income inequality and life expectancy often 
speculate about the role of policy, but direct empirical research is limited. 
Drawing on the neo-materialist perspective, we examine whether the longitudinal 
association between income inequality and life expectancy is mediated and 
moderated by policy liberalism in U.S. states (2000-2014). More liberal policy 
contexts are characterized by greater efforts to regulate the economy, 
redistribute income, and protect vulnerable groups and lesser efforts to 
penalize deviant social behavior. We find that state-level income inequality is 
inversely associated with policy liberalism and life expectancy. The association 
between income inequality and life expectancy was not mediated by policy 
liberalism but was moderated by it. The association is attenuated in states with 
more liberal policy contexts, supporting the neo-materialist perspective. This 
finding illustrates how states like New York and California (with liberal policy 
contexts) can exhibit high income inequality and high life expectancy.
