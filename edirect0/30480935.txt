Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I), also known as Von Gierke disease, is an 
inherited disorder caused by deficiencies of specific enzymes in the glycogen 
metabolism pathway. It was first described by Von Gierke in 1929 who reported 
excessive hepatic and renal glycogen in the autopsy reports of 2 children. It 
comprises 2 major subtypes, GSD Ia and GSD Ib. In GSD Ia, there is a deficiency 
of enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) which cleaves glycogen to glucose thus 
leading to hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Patients with GSD 1b have normal 
G6Pase enzyme activity but have a deficiency of the transporter enzyme, 
glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT). Patients present with manifestations of 
hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis typically around 3 to 4 months of age. In 
patients suspected of having the disease, genetic testing is the investigation 
of choice to confirm the diagnosis. Dietary treatment prevents hypoglycemia and 
improves the life expectancy of patients. However, to prevent long-term 
complications such as hepatic adenomas and renal failure, animal models of GSD I 
are being developed to study the disease more closely and develop new treatment 
strategies such as gene therapy.
