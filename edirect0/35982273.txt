Osteoarthritis (OA) is among the most common diseases affecting both axial and 
appendicular joints and the lead cause of disability worldwide. OA incidence is 
rising due to extended life expectancy and the increasing obesity epidemic. 
Several joint interventions are available to manage pain and joint function in 
patients with OA, most of these treatments being widely applied using 
intra-articular injections. In this chapter, we will describe the different 
joint interventions available for the management of pain in OA focusing on 
intra-articular injections, including discussion on the evidence regarding the 
efficacy of these treatments, based on the most recent systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses available. We also discuss the importance of imaging in guiding 
these treatments, including the different imaging modalities available for 
intra-articular injection guidance, their advantages, and disadvantages. 
Finally, we briefly discuss safety data and the consensus regarding the most 
used intra-articular treatments to manage pain in OA.
