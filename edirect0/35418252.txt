Objectives: The goal of this study was to compare cost-effectiveness of 
sacubitril/valsartan with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for 
treating chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) 
from the published articles and explore the methodology applied in the studies. 
Methods: Systematic research was conducted in February 2021 using PubMed, 
Cochrane, and EBSCO. A combination of MeSH terms of "cost-effectiveness 
analysis," "heart failure with reduced ejection fraction," "sacubitril 
valsartan," and "angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor" was employed. The 
review selected for articles published in the last five years in English. 
Results: A total of 15 studies were included in this review. We found that these 
studies had been conducted in 12 different countries. The United States had the 
greatest number of publications (5), followed by the Netherlands (2). The study 
method most used was the Markov decision model (73%). Almost all studies 
produced ICERs and QALYs that were numerically high. Conclusions: The use of 
sacubitril/valsartan associates with longer life expectancy and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
