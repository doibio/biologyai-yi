OBJECTIVES: The likelihood of providing care to a spouse in middle and older 
ages has increased as life expectancy increases, but knowledge about how the 
caregiver and care recipient influence each other's mental health is limited. 
This study examined whether a partner's physical, cognitive, and mental health 
in a spousal caregiving dyad are associated with the other partner's depressive 
symptoms in China and whether the dyadic effects vary by gender.
METHODS: This study used data from Wave 3 (2015) and Wave 4 (2018) follow-up 
surveys of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The 
analytic sample featured 1,245 dyads of care recipients aged 45 or older and 
their spouse caregivers. The Actor-Partner Interdependence Model was used to 
test the dyadic effects among all couples in the analytic sample, couples with 
wife caregivers and couples with husband caregivers, respectively.
RESULTS: We found that caregiver's depressive symptoms at Wave 3 were 
significantly associated with care recipient's depressive symptoms at Wave 4 in 
the full sample. Regardless of caregiver or care recipient roles, wives' mental 
health was impacted by their husbands' depressive symptoms, but not vice versa. 
Wife recipient's cognitive impairment was associated with husband caregiver's 
lower depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSION: This study sheds light on the mental health of couples in the 
context of caregiving in China. The findings indicate that interventions to 
support couples in a caregiving dyad need to consider the influence they have on 
each other, and the gender and health conditions of each in the dyad.
