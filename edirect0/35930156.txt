The current study aims to investigate factors affecting life expectancy in 
Pakistan with a special focus on environmental degradation measured by carbon 
emissions (CO2 emissions) on life expectancy from 1975 to 2020. The unit root 
test results show mixed order integration in the series. The bound F-test and 
Johansen cointegration test confirm the long-run association between the 
variables. The long-run estimates of autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) 
reveal that CO2 emissions, inflation rate, food production index, and death rate 
have negative effects on the life expectancy, implying that life expectancy 
shorten when CO2 increases, while per capita income, urbanization, population 
growth, birth rate, health expenditure, and education have positive effects on 
life expectancy, indicating that these factors prolong life expectancy. 
Moreover, the short-run estimates of ARDL reveal that food production index, 
urbanization, birth rate, infant mortality rate, and education have positive 
effects on the life expectancy, while inflation, per capita income, population 
growth rate, death rate, health expenditure, and CO2 emissions have negative 
effects on the life expectancy. The findings of the study suggest that the 
management authorities need to regulate carbon emissions in order to prolong 
life expectancy which is a key determinant of the economic growth.
