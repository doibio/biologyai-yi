Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) includes peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and 
venous disease. PAD is a chronic progressive atherosclerotic disease leading to 
partial or total peripheral vascular occlusion. PAD typically affects the 
abdominal aorta, iliac arteries, lower limbs, and occasionally the upper 
extremities. PAD affects nearly 200 million people worldwide with increasing 
global importance due to longer life expectancy and prolonged risk factor 
exposure. Patients with PAD have a variable disease presentation and course with 
some patients remaining asymptomatic and with others progressing to arterial 
ulceration, claudication, resting limb ischemia, and limb loss. PAD is a 
cardiovascular disease equivalent, with associated high risk fatal and non-fatal 
cardiovascular events frequently occurring, such as myocardial infarction and 
stroke. PAD is a progressive, debilitating systemic disease that requires 
interprofessional involvement for improved patient outcomes.
