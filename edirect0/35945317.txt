With the rapidly changing climate, assessing the global trends of cardiovascular 
diseases (CVDs) attributed to high and low temperatures in different climate 
zones and under varying socio-demographic levels is crucial for regulations, 
preparation, intervention, and clinical practice for CVD. Our study included 204 
countries with global CVD data ranging from 1990 to 2019. We obtained the 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR); disability-adjusted life rate of CVD 
attributed to high, low, and non-optimal temperatures; and socio-demographic 
index (SDI) data from the Global Health Data Exchange. We also downloaded the 
temperature data from the Climatic Research Unit. These 204 countries were 
divided into five climate zones and five SDI levels according to the annual 
average temperature data and SDI in 2019. The temporal trends of CVD burden 
attributed to high, low, and non-optimal temperatures were estimated by using 
the cubic regression spline and the generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). The 
total burden of temperature-related CVD has been declining in the last 30 years. 
However, the burden of CVD attributed to high temperature showed an increasing 
trend. Among different climate regions, the ASMRs of CVD attributed to high 
temperature were the highest in the tropical regions, followed by subtropical 
regions, and the lowest in the boreal regions. In the past 30 years, the burden 
of CVD attributed to high temperatures has shown a significant increasing trend, 
while declining trends are observed for non-optimal and low temperatures. The 
CVD burden attributed to high temperatures is particularly pronounced in warmer 
and low-SDI regions with an increasing trend of CVD burden due to high 
temperature.
