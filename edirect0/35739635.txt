BACKGROUND: The CHANCE-2 study compared 3 weeks of aspirin-ticagrelor to 
aspirin-clopidogrel in CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) allele carriers following 
a transient ischemic attack (TIA)/minor stroke and demonstrated a modestly lower 
risk of stroke recurrence with aspirin-ticagrelor. This stroke protection was 
largely for minor stroke and came at an increased risk of bleeding. The 
cost-effectiveness of implementing testing for LOF allele status to personalize 
antiplatelet regimen for secondary stroke prevention after a TIA/minor stroke in 
the Canadian health care context is unknown.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-analytic Markov cohort 
model with a lifetime horizon was performed to determine the costs and health 
benefits of testing for LOF allele status compared with no testing (current 
standard of care). The population of interest was patients living in Canada who 
suffered a TIA/minor stroke. Outcomes of interest were life-years gained (LYG), 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained, costs (reported in 2022 Canadian 
dollars), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We adopted the 
perspective of the Federal, Provincial, and Territorial Ministries of Health and 
used a 1.5% annual discount rate. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared to standard of care, LOF allele testing leads to 0.14 LYG 
(undiscounted), 0.12 QALYs gained (undiscounted), and additional lifetime costs 
of CAD$432 (discounted) per patient. The ICER of the LOF allele testing strategy 
is CAD$4310 per QALY gained compared with standard of care. The probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses demonstrated that LOF allele testing was cost-effective in 
more than 99.99% of simulations using a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
CAD$50,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Based on available evidence, testing for LOF allele followed by 
short duration 3 weeks of aspirin-ticagrelor compared to standard-of-care 
aspirin-clopidogrel can lead to prolonged life and improved quality of life and 
can be considered very cost-effective when compared with other well-accepted 
technologies in health and medicine.
