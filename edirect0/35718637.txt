BACKGROUND: In a subset of patients with recurrent oligometastatic prostate 
cancer (PCa) salvage surgery with prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA)-targeted radioguidance (PSMA-RGS) might be of value.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the oncological outcomes of salvage PSMA-RGS and 
determine the predictive preoperative factors of improved outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort study of oligorecurrent PCa patients 
with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy and imaging with 
PSMA positron emission tomography (PET), treated with PSMA-RGS in two tertiary 
care centers (2014-2020), was conducted.
INTERVENTION: PSMA-RGS.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Kaplan-Meier and multivariable 
Cox regression models were used to assess BCR-free (BFS) and therapy-free (TFS) 
survival. Postoperative complications were classified according to 
Clavien-Dindo.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 364 patients without concomitant treatment 
were assessed. At PSMA-RGS, metastatic soft-tissue PCa lesions were removed in 
343 (94%) patients. At 2-16 wk after PSMA-RGS, 165 patients reached a 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of <0.2 ng/ml. Within 3 mo, 24 (6.6%) 
patients suffered from Clavien-Dindo complications grade III-IV. At 2 yr, BFS 
and TFS rates were 32% and 58%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, higher 
preoperative PSA (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.02-1.12), higher number of PSMA-avid lesions (HR: 1.23, CI: 1.08-1.40), 
multiple (pelvic plus retroperitoneal) localizations (HR: 1.90, CI: 1.23-2.95), 
and retroperitoneal localization (HR: 2.04, CI: 1.31-3.18) of lesions in 
preoperative imaging were independent predictors of BCR after PSMA-RGS. The main 
limitation is the lack of a control group.
CONCLUSIONS: As salvage surgery in oligorecurrent PCa currently constitutes an 
experimental treatment approach, careful patient selection is mandatory based on 
life expectancy, low PSA values, and low number of PSMA PET-avid lesions located 
in the pelvis.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We looked at the outcomes from prostate cancer patients with 
recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy. We found that surgery may be an 
opportunity to prolong treatment-free survival, but patient selection criteria 
need to be very narrow.
