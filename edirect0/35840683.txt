Arthropods can host well-developed microbial communities, and such microbes can 
degrade pesticides and confer tolerance to most types of pests. Two cultures of 
the stored-product mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae, one with a symbiotic 
microbiome containing Wolbachia and the other without Wolbachia, were compared 
on pesticide residue (organophosphate: pirimiphos-methyl and pyrethroid: 
deltamethrin, deltamethrin + piperonyl butoxide)-containing diets. The 
microbiomes from mite bodies, mite feces and debris from the spent mite diet 
were analyzed using barcode sequencing. Pesticide tolerance was different among 
mite cultures and organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides. The pesticide 
residues influenced the microbiome composition in both cultures but without any 
remarkable trend for mite cultures with and without Wolbachia. The most 
influenced bacterial taxa were Bartonella-like and Bacillus for both cultures 
and Wolbachia for the culture containing this symbiont. However, there was no 
direct evidence of any effect of Wolbachia on pesticide tolerance. The high 
pesticide concentration residues in diets reduced Wolbachia, Bartonella-like and 
Bacillus in mites of the symbiotic culture. This effect was low for 
Bartonella-like and Bacillus in the asymbiotic microbiome culture. The results 
showed that the microbiomes of mites are affected by pesticide residues in the 
diets, but the effect is not systemic. No actual detoxification effect by the 
microbiome was observed for the tested pesticides.
