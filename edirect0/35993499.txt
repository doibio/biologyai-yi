BACKGROUND: Estimated life expectancy is one of the most important factors in 
determining treatment options for prostate cancer (PCa) patients. However, 
clinicians have few effective prognostic tools to individually assess survival 
in patients with PCa.
METHODS: We screened 283,252 patients diagnosed with PCa from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and 2015, and 
randomly divided them into the training and validation groups. We used 
univariate and multivariate Cox analyses to identify independent prognostic 
factors and further established nomograms to predict 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year 
overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) for PCa patients. The 
prediction performance of nomograms was tested and externally validated by 
Concordance index (C-index) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. 
Calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used for internal 
validation. We further developed PCa prognostic scoring system based on the 
impact of available variables on survival.
RESULTS: The variables age, race, marital status, TNM stage, surgery method, 
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, PSA value, and Gleason score identified as 
independent prognostic factors were included in the survival nomograms. The 
results of training (C-index: OS = 0.776, CSS = 0.889; AUC value: 
OS = 0.772-0.802, CSS = 0.892-0.936) and external validation (C-index: 
OS = 0.759, CSS = 0.875) indicated our nomograms had good performance in 
predicting 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS and CSS prediction. Internal validation 
using the calibration curves and DCA curves demonstrated the effectiveness of 
the prediction models. The prognostic scoring system was more effective than the 
AJCC staging system in predicting the survival of PCa patients, especially for 
OS.
CONCLUSION: The prognostic nomograms and prognostic scoring system have 
favorable performance in predicting OS and CSS of PCa patients. These 
individualized survival prediction tools may contribute to clinical decisions.
