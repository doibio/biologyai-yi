PURPOSE: Needle syringe programs (NSP) significantly reduce risk behavior and 
HIV and hepatitis transmission in people who inject drugs (PWID). However, PWID 
are underrepresented in studies on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), 
representing a barrier to evaluate effects of public health and preventive 
measures related to injecting drug use. In this study, we investigate how well 
the two questionnaires EQ-5D-3L and SF-6D measure health in PWID. We also 
estimate HRQoL in the PWID population.
METHOD: Data on demographics, injection drug use, HIV, hepatitis status, and 
self-reported HRQoL were collected from 550 PWID enrolled in the Stockholm NSP 
at enrollment and at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up. Self-rated HRQoL was 
measured as QALY, using EQ-5D-3L and the SF-6D. Item response theory (IRT) was 
used to evaluate which of the two instruments that measure health most 
accurately in this population. Regression analysis was used to estimate 
population-specific QALYs.
RESULTS: The IRT analysis showed that SF-6D was better suited to measure health 
in PWID. More specifically, SF-6D to a larger extent discriminated between 
persons regardless of their health status, while EQ-5D was more suitable to 
detect persons with poorer health. Self-rated HRQoL showed that average QALY was 
lower among PWID compared to the general Swedish population. However, a general 
increase in self-reported health was noted over time among participants.
CONCLUSION: This study increase knowledge of what instruments are most suitable 
to measure health among PWID. This is of great importance when evaluating 
effects of public health and preventive measures in the PWID population.
