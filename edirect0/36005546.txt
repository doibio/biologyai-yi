OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to compare the incidence of adverse cardiovascular 
(CV) events in older adults with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) treated with 
parathyroidectomy versus nonoperative management.
BACKGROUND: PHPT is a common endocrine disorder that is associated with 
increased CV mortality, but it is not known whether parathyroidectomy reduces 
the incidence of adverse CV events.
METHODS: The authors conducted a population-based, longitudinal cohort study of 
Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with PHPT (2006-2017). Multivariable, inverse 
probability weighted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine 
the associations of parathyroidectomy with major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACEs), CV disease-related hospitalization, and CV hospitalization-associated 
mortality.
RESULTS: The authors identified 210,206 beneficiaries diagnosed with PHPT from 
2006 to 2017. Among 63,136 (30.0%) treated with parathyroidectomy and 147,070 
(70.0%) managed nonoperatively within 1 year of diagnosis, the unadjusted 
incidence of MACE was 10.0% [mean follow-up 59.1 (SD 35.6) months] and 11.5% 
[mean follow-up 54.1 (SD 34.0) months], respectively. In multivariable analysis, 
parathyroidectomy was associated with a lower incidence of MACE [hazard ratio 
(HR): 0.92; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.90-0.94], CV disease-related 
hospitalization (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.87-0.91), and CV hospitalization-associated 
mortality (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.71-0.81) compared to nonoperative management. At 
10 years, parathyroidectomy was associated with adjusted absolute risk reduction 
for MACE of 1.7% (95% CI: 1.3%-2.1%), for CV disease-related hospitalization of 
2.5% (95% CI: 2.1%-2.9%), and for CV hospitalization-associated mortality of 
1.4% (95% CI: 1.2%-1.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large, population-based cohort study, parathyroidectomy was 
associated with a lower long-term incidence of adverse CV outcomes when compared 
with nonoperative management for older adults with PHPT, which is relevant to 
surgical decision making for patients with a long life expectancy.
