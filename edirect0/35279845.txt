Smart packaging provides one possible solution that could reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. In comparison with traditional packaging, which aims to extend the 
product's useful life and to facilitate transport and marketing, smart packaging 
allows increased efficiency, for example by ensuring authenticity and 
traceability from the product's origin, preventing fraud and theft, and 
improving security. Consequently, it may help to reduce pollution, food losses, 
and waste associated with the food supply chain. However, some questions must be 
answered to fully understand the advantages and limitations of its use. What are 
the most suitable smart packaging technologies for use in agro-industrial 
subsectors such as meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables, bakery, and pastry? What 
are the opportunities from a perspective of life extension, process 
optimization, traceability, product quality, and safety? What are the future 
challenges? An up-to-date, systematic review was conducted of literature 
relevant to the application of indicator technologies, sensors, and data 
carriers in smart packaging, to answer these questions. © 2022 Society of
