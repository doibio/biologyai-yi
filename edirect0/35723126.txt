Design and control of intelligent bionic artificial hand based on image 
recognition.

Shi P, Fang K, Yu H.

BACKGROUND: At present, the popular control method for intelligent bionic 
prosthetic hands is EMG control. However, the control accuracy of this method is 
low. It is a trend to integrate computer vision into the prosthetic hand.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to design an intelligent prosthetic hand 
based on image recognition, improve the control accuracy and the quality of life 
of the disabled.
METHODS: Convolutional neural network is used to recognize the object to be 
grasped, and the recognition result is used as a trigger signal to control our 
intelligent prosthetic hand. We have designed a four-bar linkage mechanism and a 
side swing mechanism in the structure, which can not only achieve the flexion 
and extension of fingers but also realize the adduction and abduction of the 
four fingers and the lateral swing of the thumb.
RESULTS: Through the method of image recognition, the new intelligent bionic 
hand can achieve five kinds of Human action. Including grasp, side pinch, 
three-finger pinch, two-finger pinch, and pinch between fingers.
CONCLUSIONS: The experiment result proves that the precision of image 
recognition control is very excellent, the intelligent prosthetic hand can be 
completed the corresponding task.
