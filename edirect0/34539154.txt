The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among individuals with severe mental 
illness is considerably higher than in the general population, contributing to 
the 15-20-year shorter life expectancy of this client population. The aim of 
this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, complex 
psychosocial program to reduce metabolic syndrome. Members of both the 
intervention (n = 78) and control (n = 31) group were psychiatric outpatients 
with severe/persistent mental illness struggling with one or more symptoms of 
metabolic syndrome. Beyond the default elements of similar programs such as diet 
and exercise, the intervention covered medication use, sleep hygiene, stress 
management, as well as addressing spiritual needs, mindfulness, addictions, and 
self-care. Assessment of metabolic indicators were completed at baseline, at the 
end of the 11-week intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. The trajectory 
of change over time was significantly more favorable in the treatment than in 
the control group in terms of waist circumference (p = 0.013, η2 = 0.093) and a 
positive trend emerged in relation to blood glucose level (p = 0.082, 
η2 = 0.057). However, no statistically reliable difference was observed between 
the intervention and the control group regarding the other outcome variables 
(body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum triglyceride 
level, serum HDL cholesterol level, overall metabolic syndrome severity). These 
findings suggest that to produce more robust benefits, psychosocial 
interventions targeting the metabolic health of individuals with complex mental 
health needs should be either longer in duration if resources permit or narrower 
in focus (diet and exercise mainly) if resources are scarce.
