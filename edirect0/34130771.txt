OBJECTIVES: Globally, increasing life expectancy has escalated demands on 
psychiatric services caring for a later life population. It is recognised that 
those with enduring mental illness may have specific needs with advancing age. 
In this study, we describe the characteristics of a population aged over 60 
years attending a general adult community psychiatric service and compare 
demographic and clinical features across age and diagnostic categories. The 
study aims to gather preliminary information which may guide future local mental 
health service planning.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using retrospective 
chart review of all patients aged over 60 years attending four community mental 
health teams in North Dublin. Cohorts of attenders were stratified by age 
comparing 60-64 year age group with the population aged 65 years and over. 
Attenders were also stratified by diagnosis and regression analysis was used to 
determine predictors of psychotic disorder diagnosis.
RESULTS: The study included 127 patients. There was a higher prevalence of 
psychotic disorders among those aged 65 years and over (n = 73), while those 
aged 60-64 years (n = 54) were more likely to have depression and non-affective, 
non-psychotic disorders. Among the population aged 65 years and over 78% (n = 
57) were long-term psychiatric service attenders.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the sample aged 65 years and over were long-term 
service attenders with a diagnosis of severe mental illness. Further research is 
warranted to determine optimal service delivery for later life psychiatric 
service attenders.
