BACKGROUND: Hair loss causes significant psychosocial distress to patients. 
Health utility measurements offer an objective, quantitative assessment of 
health-related quality of life (QOL).
METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study on patients with hair loss 
between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. Patient metrics were compared 
with layperson perception of alopecia, prospectively collected between August 1 
and December 31, 2017. Health utility measures were quantified using the visual 
analog scale (VAS), standard gamble (SG), and time trade-off (TTO) in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and relative to the minimal clinically 
important difference (MCID). Bonferroni correction to the significance threshold 
was performed.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with alopecia were compared with 237 laypeople. 
Patient metrics for female hair loss were all significantly lower than laypeople 
measures (VAS QALYs 0.65 ± 0.21 vs. 0.83 ± 0.18, p = 0.0001). Mean SG QALYs were 
lower for patients in the male alopecia state (0.86 ± 0.23 vs. 0.96 ± 0.12, 
p = 0.0278). Post-hair transplant improvement in TTO was significantly greater 
for patients (+ 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. + 0.02 ± 0.09, p = 0.0070) and significantly 
more often exceeded the MCID (45.2% vs. 16.9%, p = 0.0006).
CONCLUSIONS: Alopecia negatively impacts QOL, and the true patient experience is 
more taxing than what is perceived by laypeople. Hair transplantation improves 
QOL more for male patients than common perception.
