BACKGROUND: Life expectancy and the number of ultra-octogenarians increased 
significantly, thus making crucial the appropriateness of several endoscopic 
procedures in elderly patients. The aim of our study was to provide a 
retrospective analysis of the efficacy and safety of capsule endoscopy (CE) in 
patients aged over 80 years.
METHODS: In this single-centre study, 900 patients underwent capsule endoscopy 
between 2002 and 2015 for different indications; of these 106 patients aged ≥80 
years (group A) and 99 patients aged 40-60 years (control group B) were 
retrospectively selected.
RESULTS: Occult gastrointestinal bleeding accounted for 62.1% of all indications 
for capsule endoscopy in group B, compared to 95.2% in group A (P<0.001). 
Although not statistically significant, the diagnostic yield was higher in group 
A (71%) vs. group B (62%). The percentages of reaching the cecum and the median 
gastric transit time were uniform within the two groups. In contrast, small 
bowel transit time was longer in group A vs. B. Small bowel preparation was 
similar in the two groups. The exam was generally well tolerated in both groups, 
with capsule aspiration being one of the main adverse events, which occurred in 
two elderly patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data expand previous findings confirming that capsule endoscopy 
can be performed safely even in very old patients and show that the diagnostic 
yield is similar to that of younger patients.
