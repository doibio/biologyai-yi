BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by hypoxic episodes 
due to collapse of the airway during sleep and is frequently associated with 
obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). 
There is currently no pharmacological agent approved for the treatment of OSA. 
Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have the potential to both 
increase life expectancy and quality of life of these patients making them 
promising agents for this role. There are relatively few studies investigating 
this possible beneficial relationship between these drugs and OSA.
METHOD: We aimed to increase awareness on the potential benefits of SGLT2 
inhibitors in OSA patients by describing the current evidence on the 
effectiveness of these inhibitors in both overall and cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality. We performed a literature search for articles reporting on the 
use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with OSA and T2DM.
RESULTS: We identified 4 manuscripts studying the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in 475 
OSA patients with T2DM. Among them, 332 patients were administered SGLT2 
inhibitors, and 143 patients were in a control group. SGLT2 inhibitors have many 
potential positive impacts on OSA patients by targeting various mechanisms 
involved in OSA pathogenesis.
CONCLUSION: SGLT2 inhibitors are prime pharmacological candidates for the 
treatment of OSA, and additional studies are needed to better explore mechanisms 
and outcomes unique to this population. Additionally, patients with OSA often 
have multiple comorbidities that are clinical indications for SGLT2 inhibitor 
therapy. Physicians should recognize and encourage the use of these agents in 
such patients.
