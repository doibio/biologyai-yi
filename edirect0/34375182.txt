Lung cancer is one of the commonest cancers with a significant mortality rate 
for both genders, particularly in men. Lung cancer is recognized as one of the 
leading causes of death worldwide, which threatens the lives of over 1.6 million 
people every day. Although cancer is the leading cause of death in 
industrialized countries, conventional anticancer medications are unlikely to 
increase patients' life expectancy and quality of life significantly. In recent 
years, there are significant advances in the development and applications of 
nanotechnology in cancer treatment. The superiority of nanostructured approaches 
is that they act more selectively than traditional agents. This progress led to 
the development of a novel field of cancer treatment known as nanomedicine. 
Various formulations based on nanocarriers, including lipids, polymers, 
liposomes, nanoparticles and dendrimers have opened new horizons in lung cancer 
therapy. The application and expansion of nano-agents lead to an exciting and 
challenging research era in pharmaceutical science, especially for the delivery 
of emerging anti-cancer agents. The objective of this review is to discuss the 
recent advances in three types of nanoparticle formulations for lung cancer 
treatments modalities, including liposomes, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers 
for efficient drug delivery. Afterward, we have summarized the promising 
clinical data on nanomaterials based therapeutic approaches in ongoing clinical 
studies.
