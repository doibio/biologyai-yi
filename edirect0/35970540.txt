BACKGROUND: In advanced disease, breathlessness becomes severe, increasing 
health services use. Breathlessness triggered services demonstrate effectiveness 
in trials and meta-analyses but lack health economic assessment.
METHODS: Our economic study included a discrete choice experiment (DCE), 
followed by a cost-effectiveness analysis modelling. The DCE comprised 
face-to-face interviews with older patients with chronic breathlessness and 
their carers across nine UK centres. Conditional logistic regression analysis of 
DCE data determined the preferences (or not, indicated by negative β 
coefficients) for service attributes. Economic modelling estimated the costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 5 years.
FINDINGS: The DCE recruited 190 patients and 68 carers. Offering breathlessness 
services in person from general practitioner (GP) surgeries was not preferred 
(β=-0.30, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.21); hospital outpatient clinics (0.16, 0.06 to 
0.25) or via home visits (0.15, 0.06 to 0.24) were preferred. Inperson services 
with comprehensive treatment review (0.15, 0.07 to 0.21) and holistic support 
(0.19, 0.07 to 0.31) were preferred to those without. Cost-effectiveness 
analysis found the most and the least preferred models of breathlessness 
services were cost-effective compared with usual care. The most preferred 
service had £5719 lower costs (95% CI -6043 to 5395), with 0.004 (95% CI -0.003 
to 0.011) QALY benefits per patient. Uptake was higher when attributes were 
tailored to individual preferences (86% vs 40%).
CONCLUSION: Breathlessness services are cost-effective compared with usual care 
for health and social care, giving cost savings and better quality of life. 
Uptake of breathlessness services is higher when service attributes are 
individually tailored.
