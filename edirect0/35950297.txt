Patients diagnosed with radioiodine refractory thyroid cancer (RAIR-TC) are not 
amenable to novel 131 I therapy due to the reduced expression of sodium iodide 
symporter (Na+/I- symporter, NIS) and/or the impairment of NIS trafficking to 
the plasma membrane. RAIR-TC patients have a relatively poor prognosis with a 
mean life expectancy of 3-5 years, contributing to the majority of TC-associated 
mortality. Identifying RAIR-TC patients and selecting proper treatment 
strategies remain challenging for clinicians. In this review, we demonstrate the 
updated clinical scenarios or the so-called "definitions" of RAIR-TC suggested 
by several associations based on 131 I uptake ability and tumor response 
post-131 I therapy. We also discuss current knowledge of the molecular 
alterations involved in membrane-localized NIS loss, which provides a 
preclinical basis for the development of targeted therapies, in particular, 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), redifferentiation approaches, and immune 
checkpoint inhibitors.
