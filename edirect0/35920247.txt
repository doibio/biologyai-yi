OBJECTIVE: Uncontrolled asthma significantly impairs health-related quality of 
life and work productivity. Some add-on therapies, such as vitamin D 
supplements, safely reduce the rate of asthma exacerbation. The purpose of this 
study was to assess the cost-utility of vitamin D supplementation in adults with 
mild to moderate persistent asthma in Colombia.
METHODS: A Markov model was created to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) of patients with severe asthma in Colombia. Total costs and 
QALYs of two therapy strategies, vitamin D supplementation plus ICS versus ICS 
alone, were calculated over a one-year time horizon. Deterministic and 
probability sensitivity analyses were conducted, and cost-effectiveness was 
evaluated at a willingness-to-pay value of $5,180 per QALY gained.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that compared with no supplementation, 
vitamin D supplementation was associated with higher costs and higher QALYs. The 
expected annual cost per patient with vitamin D supplementation was US$1338 and 
without this supplementation it was US$1095. The QALYs per person estimated with 
vitamin D supplementation was 0.80, and without this supplementation it was 
0.63. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$1583 per 
QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Add-on vitamin D supplement was cost-effective when added to the 
usual care in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Our study 
provides evidence that should be used by decision-makers to improve clinical 
practice guidelines.
