BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To clarify whether the presence or absence of fast 
walking and habitual physical activity are independently associated with the 
incidence of functional disability.
METHODS: This historical cohort study was comprised of 9,652 (4,412 men, mean 
age 65 years) individuals aged 39-98 years without functional disability at 
baseline. Functional disability was determined based on the Japanese long-term 
care insurance system, which specified requirements for assistance in the 
activities of daily living. The impact of fast walking and habitual physical 
activity on the incidence of functional disability was analysed by Cox 
proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: The follow-up period was a median of 3.7 years during which 165 
patients were newly certified as having functional disability. In the 
multivariate analysis, baseline age in 5-year increments (hazard ratio 2.42 [95% 
confidence interval 2.18-2.69]), no habitual physical activity (1.56 
[1.07-2.27]), and not fast walking (1.89 [1.32-2.69]) significantly increased 
the risk of functional disability after adjustment for covariates. The 
stratified analysis showed that compared with physical activity (+), the impact 
of physical activity (-) on the incidence of functional disability was observed 
in those aged ≥75 years regardless of fast walking (+). Fast walking (-) 
significantly increased the risk of disability compared with fast walking (+) in 
those aged <75 years regardless of a physical activity habit.
CONCLUSION: In Japanese, slow walking speed and lack of a physical activity 
habit were shown to be independent risk factors for incident functional 
disability, with their impact differing according to age.
