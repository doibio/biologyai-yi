OBJECTIVE: Economic evaluation of early surgery compared to the endoscopy-first 
approach in CP.
BACKGROUND: In patients with painful CP and a dilated main pancreatic duct, 
early surgery, as compared with an endoscopy-first approach, leads to more pain 
reduction with fewer interventions. However, it is unknown if early surgery is 
more cost-effective than the endoscopy-first approach.
METHODS: The multicenter Dutch ESCAPE trial randomized patients with CP and a 
dilated main pancreatic duct between early surgery (surgery within 6 weeks) or 
the endoscopy-first approach in 30 centers (April 2011-September 2016). 
Healthcare utilization was prospectively recorded up to 18 months after 
randomization. Unit costs of resources were determined, and cost-effectiveness 
and cost-utility analyses were performed from societal and healthcare 
perspectives. Primary outcomes were the costs per unit decrease on the Izbicki 
pain score and per gained quality-adjusted life-year.
RESULTS: In total, 88 patients were included in the analysis, with 44 patients 
randomized to each group. Total costs were lower in the early surgery group but 
did not reach statistical significance (mean difference €-4,815 (95% 
bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval €-13,113 to €3411; P = 0.25). 
Early surgery had a probability percentage of 88.4% of being more cost-effective 
than the endoscopy-first approach at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €0 per 
day per unit decrease on the Izbicki pain score. The probability percentage per 
additional gained quality-adjusted life-year was 75.7% at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €50,000.
CONCLUSION: In patients with painful CP and a dilated main pancreatic duct, 
early surgery was more cost-effective than the endoscopy-first approach.
