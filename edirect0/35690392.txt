Adults with intellectual disabilities have increasing life expectancy but may be 
susceptible to early aging-related conditions. The purpose of this study was to 
examine associations between the presence of low muscle strength, low bone 
mineral density, and high body mass index with age and sex in adult Special 
Olympics athletes. Grip strength (n = 6,477; 40.9% female), chair stand time (n 
= 6,444; 40.5% female), body mass index (n = 7,824; 43.7% female), and bone 
mineral density (n = 3,091; 43.2% female) measurements were provided by Special 
Olympics International. Poor grip strength, chair stand time, bone mineral 
density, and body mass index were identified in 43.8%, 46.2%, 28.7%, and 50.3% 
of each sample, respectively. Increasing age was a risk factor for all 
conditions (odds ratio = 1.30-10.89; p < .05). High rates of adverse health 
conditions were observed in a sample of adults with intellectual disabilities. 
Increased risk was observed as early as the fourth decade of life.
