BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), severe 
liver vascular malformations are associated with mutations in the Activin A 
Receptor-Like Type 1 ( ACVRL1 ) gene encoding ALK1, the receptor for bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP) 9/BMP10, which regulates blood vessel development. 
Here, we established an HHT mouse model with exclusive liver involvement and 
adequate life expectancy to investigate ALK1 signaling in liver vessel formation 
and metabolic function.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC)-selective Cre 
deleter line, Stab2-iCreF3 , was crossed with Acvrl1 -floxed mice to generate 
LSEC-specific Acvrl1 -deficient mice ( Alk1HEC-KO ). Alk1HEC-KO mice revealed 
hepatic vascular malformations and increased posthepatic flow, causing right 
ventricular volume overload. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated induction of 
proangiogenic/tip cell gene sets and arterialization of hepatic vessels at the 
expense of LSEC and central venous identities. Loss of LSEC angiokines Wnt2 , 
Wnt9b , and R-spondin-3 ( Rspo3 ) led to disruption of metabolic liver zonation 
in Alk1HEC-KO mice and in liver specimens of patients with HHT. Furthermore, 
prion-like protein doppel ( Prnd ) and placental growth factor ( Pgf ) were 
upregulated in Alk1HEC-KO hepatic endothelial cells, representing candidates 
driving the organ-specific pathogenesis of HHT. In LSEC in vitro , stimulation 
or inhibition of ALK1 signaling counter-regulated Inhibitors of DNA binding 
(ID)1-3, known Alk1 transcriptional targets. Stimulation of ALK1 signaling and 
inhibition of ID1-3 function confirmed regulation of Wnt2 and Rspo3 by the 
BMP9/ALK1/ID axis.
CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic endothelial ALK1 signaling protects from development of 
vascular malformations preserving organ-specific endothelial differentiation and 
angiocrine signaling. The long-term surviving Alk1HEC-KO HHT model offers 
opportunities to develop targeted therapies for this severe disease.
