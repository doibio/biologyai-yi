When healthcare interventions prolong life, people consume medical and 
non-medical goods during the years of life they gain. It has been argued that 
the costs for medical consumption should be included in cost-effectiveness 
analyses from both a healthcare and societal perspective, and the costs for 
non-medical consumption should additionally be included when a societal 
perspective is applied. Standardized estimates of these so-called future costs 
are available in only a few countries and the impact of inclusion of these costs 
is likely to differ between countries. In this paper we present and compare 
future costs for five European countries and estimate the impact of including 
these costs on the cost-effectiveness of life-prolonging interventions. As 
countries differ in the availability of data, we illustrate how both individual- 
and aggregate-level data sources can be used to construct standardized estimates 
of future costs. Results show a large variation in costs between countries. The 
medical costs for the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom are large 
compared to Spain and Greece. Non-medical costs are higher in Germany, Spain, 
and the United Kingdom than in Greece. The impact of including future costs on 
the ICER similarly varied between countries, ranging from €1000 to €35,000 per 
QALY gained. The variation between countries in impact on the ICER is largest 
when considering medical costs and indicate differences in both structure and 
level of healthcare financing in these countries. Case study analyses were 
performed in which we highlight the large impact of including future costs on 
ICER relative to willingness-to-pay thresholds.
