OBJECTIVES: Stroke treatment with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator 
(tPA) is effective and efficient, but as its benefits are highly time dependent, 
it is essential to treat the patient promptly after symptom onset. This study 
evaluates the cost-effectiveness of a blood biomarker test to differentiate 
ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke to guide pre-hospital treatment with tPA in 
patients with suspected stroke, compared with standard hospital management. The 
standard care for patients suffering stroke consists mainly in diagnosis, 
treatment, hospitalization and monitoring.
METHODS: A Markov model was built with four health states according to the 
modified Rankin scale, in adult patients with suspected moderate to severe 
stroke (NIHSS 4-22) within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. A Spanish Health 
System perspective was used. The time horizon was 15 years. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and life-years gained (LYGs) were used as a measure of 
effectiveness. Short- and long-term direct health costs were included. Costs 
were expressed in Euros (2022). A discount rate of 3% was used. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis and several one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The use of a blood-test biomarker compared with standard care was 
associated with more QALYs (4.87 vs. 4.77), more LYGs (7.18 vs. 7.07), and 
greater costs (12,807€ vs. 12,713€). The ICER was 881€/QALY. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis showed that the biomarker test was cost-effective in 82% of 
iterations using a threshold of 24,000€/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a blood biomarker test to guide pre-hospital 
thrombolysis is cost-effective compared with standard hospital care in patients 
with ischemic stroke.
