OBJECTIVES: As life expectancy is prolonged, older people may face increased 
burdens related to supporting multi-generational family members. This study is 
aimed toward examining the effects of such an emerging type of informal care on 
the well-being of caregivers.
METHODS: Participants aged 50 and over from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on 
Aging (1996-2007, n = 4,217) were analyzed. We categorized caregiving status 
according to different care recipients: 1) older adults only, 2) grandchildren 
only, 3) both older adults and grandchildren (dual caregiving), and 4) 
non-caregivers. Well-being was measured based on depressive symptoms and degree 
of life satisfaction. Generalized Estimation Equation models were used to 
examine the association between types of caregiving and the caregivers' state of 
well-being.
RESULTS: After adjusting for all covariates, caregivers of older adults had 
significantly more depressive symptoms and less life satisfaction than 
non-caregivers, especially when caregiving for adults with ADL problems. In 
contrast, caregivers of grandchildren were not significantly affect either 
depression or life satisfaction as compared with non-caregivers. Interestingly, 
caregiving for both older adults and grandchildren had no significant effect on 
depression but positively affected the degree of life satisfaction.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight that simultaneously taking care of both older 
adults and grandchildren can buffer negative feelings in caregivers or even 
improve their mental health.
