BACKGROUND: Madelung deformity is a rare wrist anomaly that causes considerable 
pain while restricting function. In this study, we describe a radioscapholunate 
(RSL) arthrodesis with a neo-distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) in Madelung 
deformity patients with an abnormal sigmoid notch and compare results to 
patients after a reverse wedge osteotomy.
METHODS: Six wrists underwent RSL arthrodesis with a neo-DRUJ in a two-phase 
approach: (1) modified RSL arthrodesis with triquetrectomy; and (2) distal 
scaphoidectomy. Seven wrists underwent a reverse wedge osteotomy procedure.
RESULTS: There were no differences found in postoperative pain, grip strength, 
or range of motion (ROM), apart from extension, which was decreased after RSL 
arthrodesis with a neo-DRUJ. Quality of life and Michigan Hand Outcomes 
Questionnaire scores were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical outcome parameters are not different among the 
two groups, the RSL arthrodesis with construction of a neo-DRUJ could prove a 
valid treatment option for a subset of patients with a severely affected sigmoid 
notch.
