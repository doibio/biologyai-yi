Tremor is an involuntary rhythmic and oscillatory movement of a body part with a 
relatively constant frequency and variable amplitude. Alternating contractions 
of antagonistic muscles cause it. Tremor is the most common of all movement 
disorders, and essential tremor is the most common neurologic cause of postural 
or action tremor. It usually presents as a bilateral postural 6 to 12 Hz tremor 
of the hands, followed by a kinetic and resting component. The upper limbs are 
often symmetrically involved, but with disease progression, the head and voice 
(less commonly legs, jaw, face, and trunk) may be involved. Although benign 
regarding its effect on life expectancy, it often causes embarrassment and, in a 
small percentage of patients, also serious disability. Symptoms are typically 
progressive and potentially disabling, often forcing patients to change jobs or 
seek early retirement.
