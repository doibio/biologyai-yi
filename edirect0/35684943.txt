BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to estimate the health impact of 
syphilis in the United States in terms of the number of quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) lost attributable to infections in 2018.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model that simulates the natural history and 
management of syphilis. The model was parameterized by sex and sexual 
orientation (women who have sex with men, men who have sex with women [MSW], and 
men who have sex with men [MSM]), and by age at primary infection. We developed 
a separate decision tree model to quantify health losses due to congenital 
syphilis. We estimated the average lifetime number of QALYs lost per infection, 
and the total expected lifetime number of QALYs lost due to syphilis acquired in 
2018.
RESULTS: We estimated the average number of discounted lifetime QALYs lost per 
infection as 0.09 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] .03-.19). The total expected 
number of QALYs lost due to syphilis acquired in 2018 was 13 349 (5071-31 360). 
Although per-case loss was the lowest among MSM (0.06), MSM accounted for 47.7% 
of the overall burden. For each case of congenital syphilis, we estimated 1.79 
(1.43-2.16) and 0.06 (.01-.14) QALYs lost in the child and the mother, 
respectively. We projected 2332 (1871-28 250) and 79 (17-177) QALYs lost for 
children and mothers, respectively, due to congenital syphilis in 2018.
CONCLUSIONS: Syphilis causes substantial health losses in adults and children. 
Quantifying these health losses in terms of QALYs can inform cost-effectiveness 
analyses and can facilitate comparisons of the burden of syphilis to that of 
other diseases.
