BACKGROUND: While 60% of older adults have hearing loss (HL), the majority have 
never had their hearing tested.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate long-term clinical and economic effects of 
alternative adult hearing screening schedules in the USA.
DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis simulating Current Detection 
(CD) and linkage of persons with HL to hearing healthcare, compared to 
alternative screening schedules varying by age at first screen (45 to 75 years) 
and screening frequency (every 1 or 5 years). Simulated persons experience 
yearly age- and sex-specific probabilities of acquiring HL, and subsequent 
hearing aid uptake (0.5-8%/year) and discontinuation (13-4%). Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were estimated according to hearing level and treatment 
status. Costs from a health system perspective include screening ($30-120; 2020 
USD), HL diagnosis ($300), and hearing aid devices ($3690 year 1, 
$910/subsequent year). Data sources were published estimates from NHANES and 
clinical trials of adult hearing screening.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-year-old persons in US primary care across their lifetime.
INTERVENTION: Alternative screening schedules that increase baseline 
probabilities of hearing aid uptake (base-case 1.62-fold; range 1.05-2.25-fold).
MAIN MEASURES: Lifetime undiscounted and discounted (3%/year) costs and QALYs 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
KEY RESULTS: CD resulted in 1.20 average person-years of hearing aid use 
compared to 1.27-1.68 with the screening schedules. Lifetime total per-person 
undiscounted costs were $3300 for CD and ranged from $3630 for 5-yearly 
screening beginning at age 75 to $6490 for yearly screening beginning at age 45. 
In cost-effectiveness analysis, yearly screening beginning at ages 75, 65, and 
55 years had ICERs of $39,100/QALY, $48,900/QALY, and $96,900/QALY, 
respectively. Results were most sensitive to variations in hearing aid utility 
benefit and screening effectiveness.
LIMITATION: Input uncertainty around screening effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: We project that yearly hearing screening beginning at age 55+ is 
cost-effective by US standards.
