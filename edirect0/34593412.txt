PURPOSE: To evaluate the epidemiological trends and associated risk factors of 
disease burden due to trachoma.
METHODS: Data for the country-specific disability-adjusted life year (DALY) 
number, rate and age-standardised rate of trachoma together with related data of 
other common eye diseases were acquired from the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2019 database. The Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), Human Development Index (HDI), 
inequality-adjusted HDI and other related indices were obtained from published 
data or publicly available databases. Regression analyses were conducted to 
evaluate the associations between potential risk factors and the 
age-standardised DALY burden of trachoma.
RESULTS: The global DALY burden due to trachoma decreased by 37% from 1990 to 
2019 and decreased by 69.8% after adjusting for age and population growth, and, 
in available 1990-2019 data, had the greatest reduction in attributable DALYs of 
all common eye disease, with the others analysed being cataract, glaucoma, 
refractive disorders and age-related macular degeneration. Women had higher 
age-standardised DALY burden due to trachoma than men (p<0.001). The African 
region (p<0.001) had the heaviest burden among global regions. The 
age-standardised DALY rate was higher in countries with lower income (p<0.001) 
and lower SDI (p<0.001). Higher disease burden due to trachoma was associated 
with lower HDI (β=-48.102, 95% CI -86.888 to -9.316, p=0.016), lower SDI 
(β=-48.063, 95% CI -83.702 to -12.423, p<0.001) and lower expected years of 
schooling (β=-2.352, 95% CI -3.756 to -0.948, p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The global disease burden due to trachoma decreased from 1990 to 
2019 and it had the greatest reduction compared with other common eye diseases. 
Lower HDI, socioeconomic status and educational level were related to a higher 
national disease burden of trachoma. Our findings could provide necessary 
information for trachoma control and prevention.
