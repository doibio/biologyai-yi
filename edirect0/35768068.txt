Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or 
function, present for ˃3 months, with implications for health. The most used 
diagnostic criteria are a urinary albumin: creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g or an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Either of these 
diagnostic thresholds is associated with adverse health outcomes. GFR decreases 
with age and the prevalence of CKD is highest in older adults; moreover, the 
presence of CKD is associated with an increased risk of all-cause and 
cardiovascular death related to accelerated ageing in all age ranges, and the 
absolute increase in risk is highest for those aged ˃75 years. Indeed, premature 
death is a more common outcome than CKD progression to kidney failure requiring 
kidney replacement therapy. The progressive ageing of the world population 
contributes to the projection that CKD will become the second most common cause 
of death before the end of the century in countries with long life expectancy. 
The current collection of selected studies on kidney disease and ageing 
published in Age&Ageing, NDT and CKJ provides an overview of key topics, 
including cognitive decline, sarcopaenia, wasting and cardiovascular and 
non-cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the management of kidney failure and 
gender differences in CKD progression.
