Bloom syndrome, also called Bloom-Torre-Machacek syndrome or congenital 
telangiectatic erythema, is a rare genodermatosis characterized by 
genomic instability and predisposition to the development of a variety of 
cancers. Bloom syndrome is caused by mutations in the BLM gene, which induces 
the formation of an abnormal DNA helicase protein. High sister chromatid 
exchanges and quadriradial configurations are diagnostic hallmarks. The most 
prominent features include growth deficiency of prenatal onset, mild 
immunodeficiency, excessive photosensitivity with facial lupus-like skin 
lesions, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. The increased risk of 
malignancy in Bloom syndrome leads to a shortened life expectancy and increased 
morbidity in affected persons.
