Canagliflozin (Cana), a clinically important anti-diabetes drug, leads to a 14% 
increase in median lifespan and a 9% increase in the 90th percentile age when 
given to genetically heterogeneous male mice from 7 months of age, but does not 
increase lifespan in female mice. A histopathological study was conducted on 
22-month-old mice to see if Cana retarded diverse forms of age-dependent 
pathology. This agent was found to diminish incidence or severity, in male mice 
only, of cardiomyopathy, glomerulonephropathy, arteriosclerosis, hepatic 
microvesicular cytoplasmic vacuolation (lipidosis), and adrenal cortical 
neoplasms. Protection against atrophy of the exocrine pancreas was seen in both 
males and females. Thus, the extension of lifespan in Cana-treated male mice, 
which is likely to reflect host- or tumor-mediated delay in lethal neoplasms, is 
accompanied by parallel retardation of lesions, in multiple tissues, that seldom 
if ever lead to death in these mice. Canagliflozin thus can be considered a drug 
that acts to slow the aging process and should be evaluated for potential 
protective effects against many other late-life conditions.
