BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
that compromises the cognitive system and causes dementia. In general, AD 
affects people over 65 years old, which implies a social impact if we consider 
future projections due to the increase in life expectancy. The drugs currently 
marketed only slow the progression of the disease. In this sense, the search for 
new drugs is a relevant topic in medicinal chemistry. The therapeutic strategy 
adopted herein is the cholinergic hypothesis, for which acetylcholinesterase 
enzyme (AChE) inhibitors constitute the main treatment for the disease.
OBJECTIVE: This review compiles research in synthetic and natural compounds with 
AChE inhibitory function.
METHODS: Data were collected based on investigations of AChE inhibitors in the 
last 5 years of the 2010 decade. Synthetic and natural compounds were 
investigated, for which Ligand Based Drug Design (LBDD) and Structure Based Drug 
Design (SBDD) strategies were performed to better understand the 
structure-activity relationship of promising therapeutic agents.
RESULTS: Prediction of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties used to 
calculate the bioavailability radar, lipophilicity, drug-likeness, and 
pharmacokinetics parameters (SwissADME) indicated that most active compounds are 
associated with the following characteristics: molecular weight above 377 g/mol; 
molar refractivity over 114; fraction Csp3 below 0.39 and TPSA above 43 Å2. The 
most active compounds had a lipophilicity parameter in the range between 2.5 and 
4.52, a predominating lipophilic character. Atoms and bonds/interactions 
relevant for drug development were also investigated and the data pointed out 
the following tendencies: number of heavy atoms between 16 and 41; number of 
aromatic heavy atoms between 6 and 22; number of rotatable bonds between 1 and 
14; number of H-bond acceptors between 1 and 11; number of H-bond donors below 
7. Molecular docking studies indicated that all compounds had higher Goldscores 
than the drugs used as a positive control, indicating a stronger interaction 
with the enzyme.
CONCLUSION: The selected compounds represent a potential for new 
anticholinesterase drugs and may be good starting-point for the development of 
new candidates. Also, design rules can be extracted from our analysis.
