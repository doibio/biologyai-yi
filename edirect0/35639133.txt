PURPOSE: To estimate the mortality rates of a cohort of Brazilian patients after 
their first psychiatric admission and determine the possible risk factors 
associated with excess mortality.
METHODS: The study included a cohort of psychiatric patients hospitalised from 
Jan 1, 2002 to Dec 31, 2007 in the catchment area of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo 
state, Brazil. Data were linked to deaths that occurred between Jan 1, 2002 and 
Dec 31, 2016 from the SEADE Foundation (state data analysis system of São 
Paulo). The mortality rate (MR), age-sex-standardised mortality ratio (SMR), 
life expectancy at birth, and years of life lost (YLL) were computed. The 
factors associated with mortality were analysed by survival analysis using a Cox 
proportional hazards regression model.
RESULTS: Of 4019 patients admitted (54.76% male), 803 died (69.74% male) during 
the follow-up (median = 11.25 years). Mortality rates were approximately 
three-fold higher than expected (SMR = 2.90, 95% CI 2.71-3.11). The highest 
mortality rate was noted in men with alcohol-related disorders (SMR = 5.50, 95% 
CI 4.87-6.19). Male sex (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.62, 95% CI 1.37-1.92), 
higher age (aHR = 21.47, 95% CI 13.48-34.17), and unemployment (aHR = 1.22, 95% 
CI 1.05-1.43) significantly increased the mortality risk from all causes. The 
average YLL was 27.64 years with the highest YLL noted in nonalcohol 
substance-related disorders (39.22 years). The life expectancy at birth in this 
cohort was 47.27 years. Unnatural causes of death were associated with nonwhite 
skin colour and substance-related disorders.
CONCLUSION: An excess of mortality and a significant reduction in life 
expectancy of mentally disordered patients who were first admitted to 
psychiatric beds was noted, particularly patients admitted for substance-related 
disorders, which should represent a priority in mental health policies.
