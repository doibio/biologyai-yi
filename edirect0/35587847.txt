BACKGROUND: Economic evidence for comparing low fraction with ultra-hypo 
fractionated (UHF) radiation therapy in the treatment of 
intermediate-to-high-risk prostate cancer (PC) is lacking, especially in Europe. 
This study presents an economic evaluation performed alongside an ongoing 
clinical trial.
AIM: To investigate up to 6 years' follow-up whether conventional fractionation 
(CF, 78.0 Gy in 39 fractions, 5 days per week for 8 weeks) is more 
cost-effective than UHF (42.7 Gy in 7 fractions, 3 days per week for 2.5 weeks 
inclusive of 2 weekends) radiotherapy in treatment for patients with 
intermediate-to-high-risk PC.
METHOD: HYPO-RT-PC trial is an open-label, randomized, multicenter (10 in 
Sweden; 2 in Denmark) phase-3 trial. Patients from Sweden (CF 434; UHF 445) were 
included in this study. The trial database was linked to the National Patient 
Registry (NPR). Costs for inpatient/non-primary outpatient care for each episode 
were retrieved. For calculating Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 questionnaire was mapped to the EQ-5D-3L index. Multivariable regression 
analyses were used to compare the difference in costs and QALYs, adjusting for 
age and baseline costs, and health status. The confidence interval for the 
difference in costs, QALYs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated by the bootstrap percentile method.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in ICER between the two arms 
after 6 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The current study did not support that the ultra-hypo-fractionated 
treatment was more cost-effective than the conventional fraction treatment up to 
the sixth year of the trial.
