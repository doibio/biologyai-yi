This study estimated the efficiency of implementing the EmERGE Pathway of Care 
for people living with medically stable HIV in Brighton, UK; an App enables 
individuals to communicate with caregivers via their smart-phone. Individual 
data on the use of HIV outpatient services were collected one-year pre- and 
post-implementation of EmERGE. Unit costs of HIV outpatient services were 
calculated and linked with mean use of services per patient year. Primary 
outcomes were CD4 count and viral load; patient activation and quality-of-life 
measures were secondary outcomes. 565 participants were followed up April 2017 - 
October 2018: 93% men, mean age at recruitment 47.0 years (95%CI:46.2-47.8). 
Outpatient visits decreased by 9% from 5.6 (95%CI:5.4-5.8) to 5.1 
(95%CI:4.9-5.3). Face-to-face visits decreased and virtual visits increased. 
Annual costs decreased by 9% from £751 (95%CI: £722-£780) to £678 (95%CI: 
£653-£705). Including anti-retroviral drugs, total annual cost decreased from 
£7,343 (95%CI: £7,314-7,372) to £7,270 (95%CI: £7,245-7,297): ARVs costs 
comprised 90%. EmERGE was a cost-saving intervention, patients remained engaged 
and clinically stable. Annual costs were reduced, but ARVs continue to dominate 
costs. Extension of EmERGE to other people with chronic conditions, could 
produce greater efficiencies but these needs to be evaluated and monitored over 
time.
