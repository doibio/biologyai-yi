OBJECTIVE: Productivity-adjusted life-years (PALYs) offers a novel approach for 
quantifying the productivity burden of chronic conditions at the population 
level over the working lifespan. This study was undertaken to estimate the 
productivity burden of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) among working-age Australians, 
defined as lost PALYs and lost gross domestic product (GDP).
METHODS: A static life-table model was constructed to simulate the experiences 
of working Australians (between the ages of 15-64 years) with KOA and those 
without KOA, with follow-up to 65 years (retirement age), a 1-year cycle length, 
and an annual discount rate of 5%. KOA prevalence data were obtained from the 
2019 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors study. Demographic 
and mortality data were sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Health 
utilities and productivity indices were derived from published sources. 
Population-level losses in years of life, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
and PALYs attributable to KOA were estimated by comparing estimates in the KOA 
cohort to the no KOA cohort.
RESULTS: In 2019, a total of 913,539 working-age Australians were estimated to 
have KOA, with an overall prevalence of 5.5% (4.5% in men and 6.5% in women). By 
retirement age, KOA was associated with 39,602 excess deaths, 125,651 years of 
life lost, 1,938,059 QALYs lost, and 1,943,287 PALYs lost. The economic impact 
of lost productivity due to KOA amounted to 424 billion Australian dollars in 
lost GDP.
CONCLUSION: Our modeling demonstrates a significant economic burden of KOA among 
the working Australian population, with marked productivity loss. Our findings 
highlight the need for public health funding and scalable population-level 
strategies for effective KOA prevention and support to maintain productive 
working.
