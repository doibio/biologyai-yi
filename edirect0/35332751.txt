BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is emerging as an 
appealing management strategy for patients with severe aortic stenosis at 
intermediate, high or exceedingly high risk, but its risk-benefit profile in 
younger patients is less certain. We aimed to explore the outlook of patients 
aged 70 years or less and undergoing TAVI at 2 high-volume Italian institutions.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected baseline, imaging, procedural and outcome 
features of patients with age ≤70 years in whom TAVI was attempted at 
participating centers between 2012 and 2021. Non-parametric tests and bootstrap 
resampling were used for inferential purposes.
RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were included, out of >3000 screened with heart 
team involvement and >1500 receiving TAVI. Most common or relevant indications 
for TAVI reduced life expectancy (e.g. cardiogenic shock or severe left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, morbid 
obesity, active or recent extra-cardiac cancer, porcelain aorta, neurologic 
disability, cirrhosis, or prior surgical aortic valve replacement, as well as 
extreme cachexia, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. At least two contemporary 
high-risk features were present in most cases. Transapical access was used in 5 
(12.8%) cases, and a sheathless approach in 15 (38.5%). A variety of devices 
were used, including both balloon- and self-expandable devices. Clinical 
outcomes were satisfactory, despite the high-risk profile, at both short- and 
mid-term, with no in-hospital death, and 5.1% (95% confidence interval 0-12.8%) 
mortality at a median follow-up of 15 months (minimum 1; maximum 85). Notably, 
no case of significant valve deterioration requiring reintervention occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: In carefully selected patients with 70 years or less of age and 
prohibitive risk for surgery or reduced life expectancy, TAVI represents a safe 
option with a favorable mid-term survival and low rate of adverse events.
