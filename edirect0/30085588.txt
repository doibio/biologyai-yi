Immunotherapy is used to upregulate or downregulate the immune system to achieve 
a therapeutic effect in immunological mediated disorders, including 
immunodeficiencies, hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmune diseases, tissue and 
organ transplantations, malignancies, inflammatory disorders, infectious 
diseases, and any other disease, where immunotherapy can improve the quality and 
life expectancy. This activity will highlight the various types of 
immunotherapy, including mechanisms of action, adverse event profiles, and other 
key factors, e.g., dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, 
relevant interactions pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the 
management of patients with conditions that can benefit from receiving
