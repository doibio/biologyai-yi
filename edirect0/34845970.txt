BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is a proven therapeutic tool to increase the 
quality of life and life expectancy in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). 
Despite this, the PA level of pwCF is lower than recommended.
OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to identify the barriers to and 
facilitators of PA in adults with CF with heterogeneous severity.
METHODS: Twenty adults with CF (mean age = 33.3±11.7 years, mean FEV1% = 
50.55±20.4%) were recruited from two specialized centers and interviewed about 
the factors that limit and facilitate their PA. The collected data were 
transcribed, coded and analyzed using deductive and inductive methods.
RESULTS: Barriers and facilitators were classified into physical, psychological 
and environmental dimensions. The main barriers were fatigue, breathing 
difficulties, lack of available facilities, negative perceptions of PA and 
perceived health risks. The most important facilitators were respiratory 
benefits, well-being, and social support.
CONCLUSION: Although some barriers and facilitators were similar to those found 
in children with CF or adults from other vulnerable populations, others were 
specific to adults with CF, such as the risk of cross-contamination and 
transplant preparation. The comprehensive study of the barriers and facilitators 
in adults will enhance PA counseling for pwCF and help improve their compliance 
with PA recommendations.
