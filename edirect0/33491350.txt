BACKGROUND: Spinal surgery has to address the challenge of a dramatic increase 
of the growing number of older persons. The purpose of the present study was to 
project the numbers of surgically treated degenerative spine disease (DSD) in 
Austria from 2017 until 2080 to provide potential future scenarios that the 
Austrian Health system might have to face.
METHODS: Current numbers on demographic information from Austria as well as 
population projections for 2017-2080 were obtained from Statistics Austria 
(STAT). A lower/main/upper scenario reflecting low/main/high growth and ageing 
scenarios deducted from fertility, life expectancy and immigration calculations 
was used. Information on prevalence of surgically treated DSD was obtained from 
the Austrian Spine Register.
RESULTS: The population in Austria (evaluated in 2017) was 8.78 millions and is 
estimated to evolve to 7.86/10.0/13.1 millions by 2080. The total number of 
surgically treated DSD recorded in the Spine Register was 9300 and was estimated 
to be 9300/11200/13700 in 2080. The number of subjects with surgically treated 
DSD were expected to increase in the age-strata (main scenario), 100% 
corresponds to the number in each age and gender stratum: 0-40 years by 
(male/female) 2%/2%, 40-50 years -7%/-7%, 50-59 years -11%/-9%, 60-69 years 
21%/16%, 70-79 years 51%/31%, 80-89 years 211%/129% and 90+years 698%/411%.
CONCLUSIONS: Total numbers of subjects with DSD in Austria will increase from 
2017 to 2080. The increase will be substantial in those aged 80+ and those aged 
90+. The assumptions of this analysis were taken conservatively. Hence, the 
future socio-economic burden to society might be greater as projected by the 
study.
