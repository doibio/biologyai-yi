BACKGROUND: Life expectancy for people with Down syndrome is increasing, but 
older adults with Down syndrome are at greater risk of developing certain 
pathologies associated with ageing. When ageing parents can no longer look after 
their child with Down syndrome, their other children are often expected to 
shoulder this responsibility.
METHOD: We asked 120 adult siblings of a person with Down syndrome to complete a 
questionnaire on their current and anticipated relationships.
RESULTS: Most respondents considered these relationships to be positive, but 
they expressed concerns about the effects of ageing and about having to organise 
their sibling with Down syndrome's future life. We investigated the impact of 
factors relating to the respondents and to their sibling with Down syndrome 
(age, gender, social inclusion, protection regime) on these general tendencies.
CONCLUSION: Siblings need to be given support, for example, via discussion 
groups, to facilitate the transition to becoming caregivers.
