BACKGROUND: The Longevity Improvement & Fair Evidence (LIFE) Study, which was 
launched in 2019, is a multi-region community-based database project that aims 
to generate evidence toward extending healthy life expectancy and reducing 
health disparities in Japan. Herein, we describe the LIFE Study's design and 
baseline participant profile.
METHODS: Municipalities participating in the LIFE Study provide data from 
government-administered health insurance enrollees and public assistance 
recipients. These participants cover all disease types and age groups. Centered 
on healthcare claims data, the project also collects long-term care claims data, 
health checkup data, vaccination records, residence-related information, and 
income-related information. The different data types are converted into a common 
data model containing five modules (health care, long-term care, health checkup, 
socioeconomic status, and health services). We calculated the descriptive 
statistics of participants at baseline in 2018.
RESULTS: The LIFE Study currently stores data from 1,420,437 residents of 18 
municipalities. The health care module contains 1,280,756 participants (mean 
age: 65.2 years), the long-term care module contains 189,069 participants (mean 
age: 84.3 years), and the health checkup module contains 274,375 participants 
(mean age: 69.0 years). Although coverage and follow-up rates were lower among 
younger persons, the health care module includes 74,151 children (0-19 years), 
273,157 working-age adults (20-59 years), and 933,448 older persons (â‰¥60 years).
CONCLUSION: The LIFE Study provides data from over 1 million participants and 
can facilitate a wide variety of life-course research and cohort studies. This 
project is expected to be a useful platform for generating real-world evidence 
from Japan.
