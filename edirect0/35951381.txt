Effectively managing to-do lists and getting things done is a desirable 
competence. However, when things get difficult or demanding, many individuals 
struggle to put their intentions into subsequent actions. According to 
Personality Systems Interactions (PSI) theory, changes in positive affect are 
decisive for efficient intention enactment. Based on this understanding, in the 
present study we designed and evaluated an affect-focused intervention that 
practices shifting between high and low positive affect. In a control group 
design (N = 252, Mage = 26.40, SD = 10.24, range 18-66) the affective shifting 
intervention was contrasted against two other conditions (affective boosting and 
neutral). To test our assumptions, personal real-life intentions were assessed, 
and multifaceted measures (self-report, nonreactive) were applied and measured 
at different time points. To evaluate affective shifting, we tested 
interindividual benefits in the Stroop task. Additionally, we analyzed 
intervention effects on positive affect and intention enactment in real life. In 
line with our assumptions, we found that specifically those individuals who 
struggle with intention enactment (i.e., state-oriented) benefited in terms of 
better intention enactment ability in the Stroop task. Further, affective 
shifting fostered the decisive self-regulation of positive affect that directly 
improved intention enactment 3 weeks after the intervention. Lastly, affective 
shifting led to more self-coherent intention enactment, meaning a greater 
integration of Expectancy Ã— Value considerations 3 weeks after the intervention. 
Discussion of our findings highlights the importance of theory-driven and 
affect-related interventions to close the gap between intention and action.
