Pleurodesis is a procedure performed to obliterate the pleural space to prevent 
recurrent pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or to treat a persistent 
pneumothorax. Pleurodesis is commonly accomplished by draining the pleural fluid 
or intrapleural air followed by either a mechanical procedure or instilling a 
chemical irritant into the pleural space, which causes intense inflammation and 
fibrosis subsequently leading to adhesions between the two pleural 
membranes. Pleurodesis is most commonly used for recurrent malignant pleural 
effusions, e.g., in the metastatic breast or ovarian cancer and lung cancer. Due 
to the limited life expectancy of these patients, the purpose of the therapy is 
to minimize dyspnea, patient discomfort, length of hospital stay, and overall 
treatment cost. There are two types of pleurodesis: 1. Chemical pleurodesis: It 
is done by inserting a sclerosing agent into the pleural cavity via a chest 
tube. 2. Mechanical/surgical pleurodesis: This is done through medical 
thoracoscopy, video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS), or open thoracotomy.
