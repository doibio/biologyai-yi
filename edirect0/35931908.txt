BACKGROUND: For adults aged 76-85, guidelines recommend individualizing 
decision-making about whether to continue colorectal cancer (CRC) testing. These 
conversations can be challenging as they need to consider a patient's CRC risk, 
life expectancy, and preferences.
OBJECTIVE: To promote shared decision-making (SDM) for CRC testing decisions for 
older adults.
DESIGN: Two-arm, multi-site cluster randomized trial, assigning physicians to 
Intervention and Comparator arms. Patients were surveyed shortly after the visit 
to assess outcomes. Analyses were intention-to-treat.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Primary care physicians affiliated with 5 academic and 
community hospital networks and their patients aged 76-85 who were due for CRC 
testing and had a visit during the study period.
INTERVENTIONS: Intervention arm physicians completed a 2-h online course in SDM 
communication skills and received an electronic reminder of patients eligible 
for CRC testing shortly before the visit. Comparator arm received reminders 
only.
MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was patient-reported SDM Process score (range 
0-4 with higher scores indicating more SDM); secondary outcomes included 
patient-reported discussion of CRC screening, knowledge, intention, and 
satisfaction with the visit.
KEY RESULTS: Sixty-seven physicians (Intervention n=34 and Comparator n=33) 
enrolled. Patient participants (n=466) were on average 79 years old, 50% with 
excellent or very good self-rated overall health, and 66% had one or more prior 
colonoscopies. Patients in the Intervention arm had higher SDM Process scores 
(adjusted mean difference 0.36 (95%CI (0.08, 0.64), p=0.01) than in the 
Comparator arm. More patients in the Intervention arm reported discussing CRC 
screening during the visit (72% vs. 60%, p=0.03) and had higher intention to 
follow through with their preferred approach (58.0% vs. 47.1, p=0.03). Knowledge 
scores and visit satisfaction did not differ significantly between arms.
CONCLUSION: Physician training plus reminders were effective in increasing SDM 
and frequency of CRC testing discussions in an age group where SDM is essential.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03959696).
