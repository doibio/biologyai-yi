Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a major health issue worldwide, as 
patients with T2DM show an excess risk of death for cardiovascular causes, twice 
as high as the general population. Among the many complications of T2DM, heart 
failure (HF) deserves special consideration as one of the leading causes of 
morbidity and reduced life expectancy. T2DM has been associated with different 
phenotypes of HF, including HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. 
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can evaluate the metabolic and 
ventilatory alterations related to myocardial dysfunction and/or peripheral 
impairment, representing a unique tool for the clinician to study the whole HF 
spectrum. While CPET allows for a thorough evaluation of functional capacity, it 
cannot directly differentiate central and peripheral determinants of effort 
intolerance. Combining CPET with imaging techniques could provide even higher 
accuracy and further insights into the progression of the disease since signs of 
left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction can be detected during 
exercise, even in asymptomatic diabetic individuals. This review aims to dissect 
the alterations in cardiopulmonary function characterising patients with T2DM 
and HF to improve patient risk stratification.
