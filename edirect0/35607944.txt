Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide 
in which dysregulated protein synthesis plays an etiologic role. The eukaryotic 
elongation factor 1 A1 (eEF1A1) exerts significant effects on protein synthesis 
by contributing to peptide chain extension. Whereas its role in CRC remains to 
be investigated. In this study, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of 
eEF1A1 were significantly upregulated in CRC cell lines and tissues. Elevated 
expression of eEF1A1 was correlated with shorter overall survival in 94 CRC 
patients. The inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle block were observed in 
CRC cells after eEF1A1 downregulation. Mechanistically, weighted gene 
correlation network analysis and further Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) analysis suggested that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 
signaling pathways were significantly enriched in high-eEF1A1 expression group, 
and the levels of phosphorylated p38/JNK/ERK MAPK were dramatically decreased 
after eEF1A1 downregulation. Overexpression of eEF1A1 in CRC correlated with a 
poor prognosis. Collectively, this study determined the oncogenic role of eEF1A1 
in CRC proliferation and tumorigenesis. eEF1A1 might be a promising therapeutic 
target and prognostic biomarker in CRC.
