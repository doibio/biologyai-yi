The European continent has one of the longest life expectancies in the world, 
but still faces a significant challenge to meet the health targets set by the 
Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations for 2030. To improve the 
understanding of the rationale that guides health outcomes in Europe, this study 
assesses the direction and magnitude effects of the drivers that contribute to 
explain life expectancy at birth across 30 European countries for the period 
2008-2018 at macro-level. For this purpose, an aggregated health production 
function is used allowing for spatial effects. The results indicate that an 
increase in the income level, health expenditure, trade openness, education 
attainment, or urbanisation might lead to an increase in life expectancy at 
birth, whereas calories intake or quantity of air pollutants have a negative 
impact on this health indicator. This implies that health policies should look 
beyond economic factors and focus also on social and environmental drivers. The 
results also indicate the existence of significant spillover effects, 
highlighting the need for coordinated European policies that account for the 
synergies between countries. Finally, a foresight analysis is conducted to 
obtain projections for 2030 under different socioeconomic pathways. Results 
reveal significant differences on longevity projections depending on the 
adoption, or not, of a more sustainable model of human development and provides 
valuable insight on the need for anticipatory planning measures to make longer 
life-spans compatible with the maintenance of the welfare state.
