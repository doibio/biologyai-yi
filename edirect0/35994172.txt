BACKGROUND: Caste plays a significant role in individual healthcare access and 
health outcomes in India. Discrimination against low-caste communities 
contributes to their poverty and poor health outcomes. The Rashtriya Swasthya 
Bima Yojana (RSBY), a national health insurance program, was created to improve 
healthcare access for the poor. This study accounts for caste-based disparities 
in RSBY enrollment in India by decomposing the contributions of relevant 
factors.
METHODS: Using the data from the 2015-2016 round of the National Family Health 
Survey, we compare RSBY enrollment rates of low-caste and high-caste households. 
We use a non-linear extension of Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and estimate two 
models by pooling coefficients across the comparison groups and all caste 
groups. Enrollment differentials are decomposed into individual- and 
household-level characteristics, media access, and state-level fixed effects, 
allowing 2000 replications and random ordering of variables.
RESULTS: The analysis of 480,766 households show that scheduled tribe households 
have the highest enrollment (18.85%), followed by 14.13% for scheduled caste, 
10.67% for other backward caste, and 9.33% for high caste. Household factors, 
family head's characteristics, media access, and state-level fixed effects 
account for a 32% to 52% gap in enrollment. More specifically, the enrollment 
gaps are attributable to differences in wealth status, educational attainment, 
residence, family size, dependency ratio, media access, and occupational 
activities of the households.
CONCLUSIONS: Weaker socio-economic status of low-caste households explains their 
high RSBY enrollments.
