PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to use the finite element method (FEM) to 
reproduce fracture lines that reach the lateral tibial plateau during open-wedge 
high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) in patients with Type III lateral hinge fracture 
(LHF). It was hypothesized that the FEM could clarify biomechanical causes of 
Type III LHF, enabling prevention of adverse complications.
METHODS: This study used the nonlinear FEM to analyze the data of eight knees in 
eight patients (two males and six females) with Type III LHF among 82 patients 
who underwent OWHTO, as well as the data of eight individuals with no LHF. To 
predict the onset of Type III LHF, simulation models were also developed in 
which posterior osteotomy sufficiency varied from 50% to perfect, the latter 
defined as osteotomy reaching the hinge point.
RESULTS: Real-life instances of Type III LHF caused by insufficient posterior 
osteotomy were reproduced in all patient-specific FEM models, and these models 
accurately predicted fracture types and locations. During opening of the 
osteotomy gap, the fracture line reached the lateral tibial plateau, and 
extended vertically from the end of the insufficient posterior osteotomy, 
avoiding the rigid proximal tibiofibular joint. In contrast, sufficient 
posterior osteotomy resulted in a lack of LHF. Posterior osteotomy 
extension ≥ 70% of the width of the osteotomy plane was the cut-off value to 
prevent Type III LHF.
CONCLUSION: Forced opening of insufficient posterior osteotomy was found to be a 
biomechanical cause of Type III LHF that extended perpendicularly to the lateral 
tibial plateau, avoiding the proximal tibiofibular joint. The clinical 
significance of this study is that sufficient posterior osteotomy during OWHTO, 
defined as at least 70% of the width of the osteotomy plane, can prevent Type 
III LHF.
