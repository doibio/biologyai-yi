OBJECTIVES: Evaluate effects of long-term bimekizumab treatment on 
patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, symptoms and the impact of PsA on 
patients.
METHODS: Patients with active PsA were enrolled into BE ACTIVE, a 48-week 
randomised controlled trial (NCT02969525). After Week 48, patients could enter a 
104-week open-label extension (NCT03347110), receiving bimekizumab 160 mg every 
four weeks. PRO measures assessed included arthritis pain visual analogue scale 
(VAS), PsA Impact of Disease (PsAID)-9, 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and 
HAQ-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Results were analysed as mean (S.E.M.) changes 
from baseline (CfB) from Week 0 to the end of the open-label extension (3 years) 
and as percentage of patients reaching patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS) 
for global impact (PsAID-9 total score ≤4) and normal function (HAQ-DI total 
score <0.5). Non-responder imputation was applied to missing binary outcomes.
RESULTS: In 206 patients (mean age 49.3 years, 51.0% male), completion rate was 
high; 161 (78.2%) patients completed Week 152. Bimekizumab treatment was 
associated with long-term sustained improvements in pain [arthritis pain VAS 
CfB; Week 48: -29.9 (1.9); Week 152: -32.0 (1.9)] and fatigue [PsAID-9 fatigue 
CfB; -2.4 (0.2); -2.7 (0.2)]. High percentages of patients achieved acceptable 
symptom state (PsAID-9 PASS: 75.2%; 65.0%) and normalised function (HAQ-DI <0.5: 
49.0%; 46.1%). Improvements in patient global assessment and SF-36 Physical 
Component Summary were also sustained.
CONCLUSIONS: Bimekizumab treatment was associated with long-term sustained 
improvements in pain and fatigue, reducing overall impact of PsA on patients. 
Physical function and quality of life improved up to 3 years.
