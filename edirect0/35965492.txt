The main objectives of this study were to (i) assess variation within fine 
particles (PM2.5) and tropospheric ozone (O3) time series in Khorramabad (Iran) 
between 2019 (before) and 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic); (ii) assess 
relationship between PM2.5 and O3, the PM2.5/O3 ratio, and energy consumption; 
and (iii) estimate the health effects of exposure to ambient PM2.5 and O3. From 
hourly PM2.5 and O3 concentrations, we applied both linear-log and integrated 
exposure-response functions, city-specific relative risk, and baseline incidence 
values to estimate the health effects over time. A significant correlation was 
found between PM2.5 and O3 (r =-0.46 in 2019, r =-0.55 in 2020, p < 0.05). The 
number of premature deaths for all non-accidental causes (27.5 and 24.6), 
ischemic heart disease (7.3 and 6.3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17 
and 19.2), and lung cancer (9.2 and 6.25) attributed to ambient PM2.5 exposure 
and for respiratory diseases (4.7 and 5.4) for exposure to O3 above 10 µg m-3 
for people older than 30-year-old were obtained in 2019 and 2020. The number of 
years of life lost declined by 11.6% in 2020 and exposure to PM2.5 reduced the 
life expectancy by 0.58 and 0.45 years, respectively in 2019 and 2020. Compared 
to 2019, the restrictive measures associated to COVID-19 pandemic led to 
reduction in PM2.5 (-25.5%) and an increase of O3 concentration (+ 8.0%) in 
Khorramabad.
