Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United 
States and worldwide. It is only second to pancreatic cancer with the shortest 
life expectancy. It plagues millions of people every year. Currently, over 5 
million people have an HF diagnosis, and that number is only expected to rise in 
the future. Advanced heart failure or stage D disease affects >10% of the heart 
failure population. In the most advanced phase of heart failure, heart 
transplantation (HT) is the only means of improving the quality of life and 
survival in these patients. Unfortunately, not all patients who need a heart 
transplant meet criteria to receive a heart transplant. This chapter will cover 
in detail patient selection for a heart transplant including indications, 
contraindications, medical professionals required to assess patient selection, 
preparation, and clinical significance.
