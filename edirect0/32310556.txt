Erikson’s Stages of Psychosocial Development is a theory introduced in the 1950s 
by the psychologist and psychoanalyst Erik Erikson. It built upon Freud’s theory 
of psychosexual development by drawing parallels in childhood stages while 
expanding it to include the influence of social dynamics as well as the 
extension of psychosocial development into adulthood. It posits eight sequential 
stages of individual human development influenced by biological, psychological, 
and social factors throughout the lifespan. This bio-psychosocial approach has 
influenced several fields of study, including gerontology, personality 
development, identity formation, life cycle development, and more.
