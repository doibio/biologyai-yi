Frailty, a state of reduced physiological reserve, has not been studied in 
consumers with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, despite known elevated rates 
of comorbidity and psychosocial impairment. This study applies a frailty index 
to the electronic medical records of 78 adults with treatment-resistant 
schizophrenia, aged 18-64 years, to determine the prevalence and characteristics 
of frailty (defined as a frailty index score > 0.21). The mean frailty index 
score was 0.24 (SD = 0.091, range = 0.061-0.54), with 52.6% of the population 
categorised as frail (40.0% in those aged 18-39 years). Frailty was positively 
correlated with age and psychiatric illness severity. This study provides novel 
evidence that individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia have a high 
rate of frailty and become frail at a younger age. Routine frailty assessments 
could be used to trigger the delivery of appropriate interventions, which have 
the potential to improve life expectancy and quality of life.
