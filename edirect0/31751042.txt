Epilepsy affects about seventy million of the global population and is a 
chronic, debilitating condition, with the vast majority of these cases 
originating in the temporal lobe. Furthermore, epilepsy of the temporal lobe can 
further subdivide into two categories based on the anatomical origin of 
epileptic focus: Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE): Involving the anatomy of 
the innermost structure of the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, 
parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala; this is the most common form of temporal 
lobe seizures and is usually secondary to a pathological process known as 
hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (LTLE): Also referred 
to as neocortical temporal lobe seizures.  These are very rare and most commonly 
secondary to genetic or acquired structural/anatomical lesions. The impact of 
epilepsy leads to a decrease in quality-of-life indices, shortened 
life-expectancy, and by extension, bears a significant economic impact for the 
individual and society.
