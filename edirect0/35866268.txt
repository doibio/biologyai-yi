OBJECTIVES: The mutual influence between end-of-life cancer patients and their 
family caregivers is widely endorsed. The present study aimed to explore the 
relationship between end-of-life cancer patients' dignity-related distress and 
the distress of their caregivers.
METHOD: A cross-sectional approach was used. The sample consisted of 128 
patients with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) below 50 and a life 
expectancy of a few weeks, and their family caregivers. Personal and clinical 
data were collected and validated rating scales were administered: Patient 
Dignity Inventory (PDI) to terminal cancer patients; Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS), Demoralization Scale (DS), Herth Hope Index (HHI), 
Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA), Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36), and 
Distress Thermometer (DT) to caregivers.
RESULTS: Findings highlighted significant correlations between patients' scores 
on the Psychological Distress PDI subscale and the PDI Total Score and 
caregivers' Emotional Role. Patients' Psychological Distress, PDI Total Score, 
and Loss of Purpose and Meaning were associated with caregivers' Disrupted 
Schedule. Finally, patients' Physical Symptoms and Dependency, Loss of Purpose 
and Meaning, and PDI Total Score were correlated with caregivers' 
Disheartenment.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The results highlighted the key role of dignity as a 
relational dimension during the end-of-life phase. Therefore, because of 
caregivers' distress could affect patients' dignity-related distress by 
influencing the interpersonal aspects of patients' autonomy, it would be 
important to relieve caregivers' distress in order to promote patients' autonomy 
and minimize their fear of being a burden.
