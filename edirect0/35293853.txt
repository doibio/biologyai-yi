BACKGROUND: A palliative care approach (PCA), including advanced care planning 
(ACP), should be considered for patients with limited life expectancy. The 
Belgian Palliative Care Indicators Tool (Be-PICT) has been released to help 
identify patients who may benefit from such approach. This study aimed at 
measuring 1-year mortality and describe the quality of life in older inpatients, 
according to baseline Be-PICT results.
METHODS: Prospective multicentre cohort study in older patients (≥ 75 years) 
admitted at geriatrics and cardiology wards of four Belgian hospitals. The 
palliative profile was defined as a positive Be-PICT.1, defined by the presence 
of its three criteria, i.e. a negative physician's answer to the surprise 
question 'would you be surprised if this patient dies in the 6-12 next months?', 
≥ 1 poor health indicator and ≥ 1 life-limiting condition.
RESULTS: Of the 379 patients (50% aged ≥85 years; 51% female), 52 (14%) 
presented a palliative profile and 83 (23%) died within 1 year. Be-PICT.1 showed 
the following characteristics to predict 1-year mortality: sensitivity 0.54, 
specificity 0.83, positive and negative predictive values 0.48 and 0.86, 
positive and negative likelihood ratios 3.22 and 0.55. The patients with a 
palliative profile were at higher mortality risk (hazard ratio 4.79 p < 0.001) 
and 1-year mortality rate (45%). Not using the SQ allowed to improve sensitivity 
to include a larger number of patients who may benefit from ACP and PCA.
CONCLUSIONS: Be-PICT.1 is a simple case-finding tool to identify older 
inpatients being at high mortality risk and candidates for ACP and PCA.
