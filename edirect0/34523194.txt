OBJECTIVE: The number of teeth has been shown to affect mortality. However, it 
is unclear why the number of teeth is associated with mortality. We focused on 
the number of teeth and malnutrition and examined whether these differences 
affect 3-year all-cause mortality among very elderly individuals.
METHODS: This analysis was conducted using data from the Tokyo Oldest Old Survey 
on Total Health study. Altogether 513 participants ≥85 years were categorized 
based on remaining teeth (0, 1-7, 8-18, ≥19). All-cause mortality was determined 
by calculating the cumulative 3-year survival rate according to the remaining 
number of teeth and the presence/absence of malnutrition. Further, hazard ratios 
(HRs) were analyzed using Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: No difference was observed according to the number of teeth (p = 
0.638), but the presence/absence of malnutrition was significantly associated 
with mortality (p < 0.001). Malnutrition was independently associated with 
higher HRs, even after adjusting for confounding factors associated with 
mortality. (HR: 2.315, 95% CI: 1.431-3.746). Additionally, adjusting for the 
number of teeth, HR remained significant (HR: 2.365, 95% CI: 1.449-3.853).
CONCLUSION: In the very elderly, malnutrition-but not the number of teeth-was 
independently associated with 3-year all-cause mortality after adjusting for 
various health issues.
