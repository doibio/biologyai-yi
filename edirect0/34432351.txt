BACKGROUND: Māori in New Zealand (NZ) are disproportionately affected by chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and experience lower life expectancy on community dialysis 
compared with non-Māori. We previously identified a higher renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) requirement for Māori in our intensive care unit (ICU), the 
tertiary referral centre for NZ's Te Manawa Taki region.
AIM: To describe mortality outcomes by ethnicity in the population requiring RRT 
in our ICU.
METHODS: Retrospective audit of the Australia and NZ Intensive Care Society 
database for adult admissions to our general ICU from Te Manawa Taki between 
2014 and 2018. Patients were stratified by non-RRT requirement (non-RRT), 
RRT-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI-RRT) and RRT-requiring end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD).
RESULTS: Relative to the population of Te Manawa Taki, Māori were 
over-represented across all strata, especially ESRD (61.8%), followed by AKI-RRT 
(35.0%) and non-RRT (32.4%) (P < 0.001). There was no excess mortality by 
ethnicity in any stratum. Crude in-ICU mortality was similar by ethnicity among 
AKI-RRT (30.8% among Māori, vs 31.5%; P = 1.000) and ESRD (16.4% among Māori, vs 
20.6%; P = 0.826). This trend remained at 1 year. Adjusted for clinically 
selected variables, neither AKI-RRT nor ESRD mortality was predicted by Māori 
ethnicity, both in-ICU and at 1 year. Irrespective of ethnicity, AKI-RRT 
patients had highest in-ICU mortality (31.2%; P < 0.001), while ESRD had highest 
1-year mortality (46.1%; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Increased RRT requirement among Māori in our ICU is due to higher 
representation among ESRD. We did not demonstrate excess mortality by ethnicity 
in any stratum. AKI-RRT had higher in-ICU mortality than ESRD, but this reversed 
at 1 year.
