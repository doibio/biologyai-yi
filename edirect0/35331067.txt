AIMS: There are substantial differences in remaining life expectancy at higher 
ages between occupational groups. These differences may be the effect of 
work-related exposures, lifestyle factors of workers in specific occupations, 
socioeconomic position or a combination of this. The scope of this paper is the 
extent to which occupational differences in remaining life expectancy persist 
after retirement, which would suggest that occupational exposures alone are not 
likely to explain all the difference.
METHODS: All individuals born between 1925 and 1939 who reported occupational 
information in the Census 1985 and were residents in Sweden to the end of 2020 
or who died were included and followed for death until 2020. The Nordic 
Classification of Occupations was used to create nine occupational groups. 
Partial life expectancy and age-specific death rates were applied to examine 
mortality differentials.
RESULTS: This study showed substantial differences in partial life expectancy 
across the occupational cohorts with the biggest difference being about 2 years. 
The mortality differences persisted with increasing age, both when measured as 
absolute numbers as well as relative numbers.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of convergence in mortality at high ages suggests that 
factors associated with lifestyle may play a larger role than occupational 
factors for the mortality differences between occupational groups at high ages. 
However, it cannot be ruled out that long-lasting effects of earlier 
occupational exposures also contribute. Regardless of the exact mechanism, we 
conclude that there is room for further reduction in mortality at high ages and, 
thus, for further improvement in life expectancy.
