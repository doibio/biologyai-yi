INTRODUCTION: Long finger skeletal fractures are common injuries. In displaced 
forms, surgical treatment is required. With the advent of headless cannulated 
screws, the technique has been simplified and allows reduction in both planes. 
The objective of our study was to evaluate the functional recovery of patients 
operated on by this technique.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: We conducted a retrospective single-center study between 
2019 and 2022. Eleven patients were followed and 12 fractures analyzed. A 
radio-clinical follow-up was carried out at 1 month then at the last follow-up 
with an evaluation of the articular amplitudes and a quality of life score 
(QuickDash, QD). The time to return to professional and sporting activities, 
pain (EVA) was collected. An anatomical/scannographic evaluation was performed 
to assess tendon and cartilage damage.
RESULTS: At the last follow-up, the average global flexion was 266° and the 
extension was total. An average QD score of 15.9 and a Jamar force of 106% 
compared to the healthy side were observed. The return to physical and 
professional activities was earlier and the pain quickly tolerable. No secondary 
displacement was objectified and all were consolidated at the last follow-up, 
without malunion. No patient had been operated on secondarily.
CONCLUSION: This technique seems to be a safe and non-traumatic. It allows a 
faster return to sports and professional activities with fewer complications and 
no need to remove the material.
