OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to demonstrate how to estimate the value of health 
gain after patients with a multisystem disease achieve a condition-specific 
composite response endpoint.
METHODS: Data from patients treated in routine practice with an exemplar 
multisystem disease (systemic lupus erythematosus) were extracted from a 
national register (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Biologics Register). Two 
bespoke composite response endpoints (Major Clinical Response and Improvement) 
were developed in advance of this study. Difference-in-differences regression 
compared health utility values (3-level version of EQ-5D; UK tariff) over 6 
months for responders and nonresponders. Bootstrapped regression estimated the 
incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), probability of QALY gain after 
achieving the response criteria, and population monetary benefit of response.
RESULTS: Within the sample (n = 171), 18.2% achieved Major Clinical Response and 
49.1% achieved Improvement at 6 months. Incremental health utility values were 
0.0923 for Major Clinical Response and 0.0454 for Improvement. Expected 
incremental QALY gain at 6 months was 0.020 for Major Clinical Response and 
0.012 for Improvement. Probability of QALY gain after achieving the response 
criteria was 77.6% for Major Clinical Response and 72.7% for Improvement. 
Population monetary benefit of response was £1 106 458 for Major Clinical 
Response and £649 134 for Improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Bespoke composite response endpoints are becoming more common to 
measure treatment response for multisystem diseases in trials and observational 
studies. Health technology assessment agencies face a growing challenge to 
establish whether these endpoints correspond with improved health gain. Health 
utility values can generate this evidence to enhance the usefulness of composite 
response endpoints for health technology assessment, decision making, and 
economic evaluation.
