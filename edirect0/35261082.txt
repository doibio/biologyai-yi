PURPOSE: We sought to understand concerns fundamental to planning medical 
education specific to rural southern African Americans who are virtually 
nonexistent in American medical schools.
METHODS: A diverse multidisciplinary research team conducted this qualitative 
study with 3 focus groups, including 17 rural medical educators recruited 
nationwide, 10 African American alumni of a rural medical education pipeline in 
Alabama, and 5 community and institutional associates of this pipeline. Analysis 
of recorded transcripts generated themes fitting an ecological model suggesting 
concerns and intervention foci at individual, community, and institutional 
levels.
FINDINGS: Three major themes operating at all ecological levels were: (1) How 
"rural minority student" is defined, with "rural" often supplanting race to 
indicate minority status; (2) Multiple factors relate to rural racial minority 
student recruitment and success, including personal relationships with peers, 
mentors, and role models and supportive institutional policies and culturally 
competent faculty; and (3) Challenges to recruitment and retention of rural 
minority students, especially financial concerns and preparation for medical 
education.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that individuals, communities, and 
institutions provide intervention points for planning medical education specific 
to southern rural African Americans. These spheres of influence project a need 
for partnership among communities and rural medical educators to affect broad 
programmatic and policy changes that address the dire shortage of rural African 
American health professionals to help ameliorate health inequities experienced 
in their home communities. It is likely that linear thinking and programming 
will be replaced by integrated, intertwined conceptualizations to reach this 
goal.
