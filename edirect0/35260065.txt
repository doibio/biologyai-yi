BACKGROUND: Stress factors lead to a shift in the antioxidant-prooxidant 
relationship, allowing an increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) by mitochondria, which results in the development of oxidative stress. 
Consequently, it is possible to put forward an assumption that drugs which 
reduce the excessive generation of ROS by these organelles should increase the 
body's resistance to stress factors. Antioxidants can be used as such drugs. In 
this regard, the aim of this work was to study the bioenergetics characteristic 
of mitochondria under stress conditions and under the action of 
2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridinium hydroxybutanedioate (ethoxidol).
METHODS: The antiradical activity of the drug was evaluated by the 
chemiluminescent method (CL). The functional state of the mitochondria was 
studied with reference to the level of lipid peroxidation by the 
spectrofluorimetry and in terms of fatty acid composition of mitochondrial 
membranes using the chromatography technique. The study of mitochondrial 
morphology was performed employing the method of atomic force microscopy.
RESULTS: The injection in mice of ethoxidol at a dose of 10-5 mol/kg for 7 days 
led to the prevention of the stress-induced increase in the intensity of LPO in 
the membranes of the mitochondria, and swelling of these organelles; it also 
prevented a decrease in the content of unsaturated fatty acids, containing 18 
and 20 carbon atoms. At the same time, ethoxidol increased the life expectancy 
of mice by 3.0-4.2 times in conditions of various types of hypoxia.
CONCLUSION: The adaptogenic properties of ethoxidol can be attributed to its 
antiradical and antioxidant properties.
