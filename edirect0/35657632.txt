OBJECTIVE: Class III obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40 kg/m2 ) is associated 
with worse knee pain and total knee replacement (TKR) outcomes. Because 
bariatric surgery yields sustainable weight loss for individuals with BMI ≥40 
kg/m2 , our objective was to establish the value of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
(RYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in conjunction with usual care 
for knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients with BMI ≥40 kg/m2 .
METHODS: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy model to assess long-term clinical 
benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of RYGB and LSG. We derived model inputs 
for efficacy, costs, and complications associated with these treatments from 
published data. Primary outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), all 
discounted at 3%/year. This analysis was conducted from a health care sector 
perspective. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in input 
parameters.
RESULTS: The usual care + RYGB strategy increased the quality-adjusted life 
expectancy by 1.35 years and lifetime costs by $7,209, compared to usual care 
alone (ICER = $5,300/QALY). The usual care + LSG strategy yielded less benefit 
than usual care + RYGB and was dominated. Relative to usual care alone, both 
usual care + RYGB and usual care + LSG reduced opioid use from 13% to 4%, and 
increased TKR usage from 30% to 50% and 41%, respectively. For cohorts with BMI 
between 38 and 41 kg/m2 , usual care + LSG dominated usual care + RYGB. In the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$50,000/QALY, usual care + RYGB and usual care + LSG were cost-effective in 70% 
and 30% of iterations, respectively.
CONCLUSION: RYGB offers good value among knee OA patients with BMI ≥40 kg/m2 , 
while LSG may provide good value among those with BMI between 35 and 41 kg/m2 .
