Nowadays, the strong increase in products consumption, the purchase of products 
on online platforms as well as the requirements for greater safety and food 
protection are a concern for food and packaging industries. Active packaging 
brings huge advances in the extension of product shelf-life and food degradation 
and losses reduction. This systematic work aims to collect and evaluate all 
existing strategies and technologies of active packaging that can be applied in 
food products, with a global view of new possibilities for food preservation. 
Oxygen scavengers, carbon dioxide emitters/absorbers, ethylene scavengers, 
antimicrobial and antioxidant active packaging, and other active systems and 
technologies are summarized including the products commercially available and 
the respective mechanisms of action. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.
