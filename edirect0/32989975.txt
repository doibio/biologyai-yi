BACKGROUND: Malignant intrinsic brain tumors are a hazardous disease with 
limited life expectancy despite intensive research in new targeted treatment 
options. Lately, proteasome inhibitors have been identified as potent agents 
causing death in glioma cell lines. It is the aim of the present study to 
identify proteasomal activity in the CSF of patients suffering from malignant 
brain tumors.
METHODS: A total of 24 patients with histological confirmed brain tumors (12 
malignant gliomas, 12 metastases) were included and CSF probes preoperatively 
analyzed for concentration and enzymatic activity of free circulating 
proteasome. Tumor volumina were assessed using the preoperative MRI and 
correlated with the CSF findings. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
(18.0.3; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS: Extracellular proteasomes were found in all CSF samples showing 
enzymatic activity. Proteasome concentrations (28 ng/mL and 23 ng/mL, resp.) 
were elevated compared to a historical control group. Proteasomal enzymatic 
chymotrypsin-like activity was significantly raised in patients with gliomas 
(mean 31 fkat/ mL) compared to controls (P<0.049), whereas the enzymatic 
activity was not significantly elevated in metastases (P=0.109). In gliomas, 
neither concentration nor enzymatic activity correlated with the preoperative 
assessed tumor volume.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study clearly showed that the proteasomal activity in 
the CSF is significantly elevated in patients with intrinsic brain tumors. 
Further studies need to identify the proteasomal concentration and enzymatic 
activity as a potential biomarker for the effectiveness of any treatment and for 
the early diagnosis of a possible recurrence of the disease.
