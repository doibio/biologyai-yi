PURPOSE: Novel pharmaceutical treatments reducing cardiovascular events in 
dyslipidaemia patients must demonstrate clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness 
to promote long-term adoption by patients, physicians, and insurers.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of statin monotherapy compared to 
additive lipid-lowering therapies for primary and secondary cardiovascular 
prevention from the perspective of Germany's healthcare system.
METHODS: Transition probabilities and hazard ratios were derived from 
cardiovascular outcome trials for statin combinations with icosapent ethyl 
(REDUCE-IT), evolocumab (FOURIER), alirocumab (ODYSSEY), ezetimibe (IMPROVE-IT), 
and fibrate (ACCORD). Costs and utilities were retrieved from previous 
literature. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was simulated 
with a Markov cohort model. The main outcomes were the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: For primary prevention, the addition of icosapent ethyl to statin 
generated 0.81 QALY and €14,732 costs (ICER: 18,133), whereas fibrates yielded 
0.63 QALY and € - 10,516 costs (ICER: - 16,632). For secondary prevention, the 
addition of ezetimibe to statin provided 0.61 QALY at savings of € - 5,796 
(ICER: - 9,555) and icosapent ethyl yielded 0.99 QALY and €14,333 costs (ICER: 
14,485). PCSK9 inhibitors offered 0.55 and 0.87 QALY at costs of €62,722 and 
€87,002 for evolocumab (ICER: 114,639) and alirocumab (ICER: 100,532), 
respectively. A 95% probability of cost-effectiveness was surpassed at €20,000 
for icosapent ethyl (primary and secondary prevention), €119,000 for alirocumab, 
and €149,000 for evolocumab.
CONCLUSIONS: For primary cardiovascular prevention, a combination therapy of 
icosapent ethyl plus statin is a cost-effective use of resources compared to 
statin monotherapy. For secondary prevention, icosapent ethyl, ezetimibe, 
evolocumab, and alirocumab increase patient benefit at different economic costs.
