Most of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are sporadic and occur after age 65. With 
prolonged life expectancy and general population aging, AD is becoming a 
significant public health concern. The immune system supports brain development, 
plasticity, and homeostasis, yet it is particularly vulnerable to aging-related 
changes. Aging of the immune system, called immunosenescence, is the 
multifaceted remodeling of the immune system during aging. Immunosenescence is a 
contributing factor to various age-related diseases, including AD. Age-related 
changes in brain immune cell phenotype and function, crosstalk between immune 
cells and neural cells, and neuroinflammation work together to promote 
neurodegeneration and age-related cognitive impairment. Although numerous 
studies have confirmed the correlation between systemic immune changes and AD, 
few studies focus on the immune state of brain microenvironment in aging and AD. 
This review mainly addresses the changes of brain immune microenvironment in 
aging and AD. Specifically, we delineate how various aspects of the brain immune 
microenvironment, including immune gateways, immune cells, and molecules, and 
the interplay between immune cells and neural cells, accelerate AD pathogenesis 
during aging. We also propose a theoretical framework of therapeutic strategies 
selectively targeting the different mechanisms to restore brain immune 
homeostasis.
