BACKGROUND: We assessed the concordance among urologists' judgment of health 
quartiles for patients with localized prostate cancer, and compared the life 
expectancy (LE) and ensuing treatment recommendations when following National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines based on actuarial life tables 
versus the Kent model, a validated LE prediction model.
METHODS: NCCN suggests using actuarial life tables and relying on surgeon 
assessment of patient health to increase (for the best quartile) or decrease 
(for the worst quartile) LE by 50%. Eleven urologic surgeons allocated quartile 
of health and recommended treatments for ten patient vignettes. The 10-year 
survival probability was calculated using the Kent model and compared to the 
life-table estimate based on health quartile by surgeon consensus.
RESULTS: Surgeon assessment agreed with the presumed true quartile of health 
based on a validated model in 41% of cases. For no case did three-quarters of 
surgeons assign health quartile correctly; in half of cases, <50% of surgeons 
assigned the correct quartile. The NCCN comorbidity-adjusted LE estimates 
underestimated risk of death in the best health quartile and overestimated risk 
of death in the worst health quartile, compared to the Kent model. Patients with 
LE > 10 years on NCCN estimation were recommended more frequently for surgery 
(81%) and those with ≤10 years estimated LE were more commonly recommended for 
radiation (57%) or observation (29%).
CONCLUSIONS: A method based on physician-assessed health quartiles for LE 
estimation, as suggested by the NCCN guidelines, appears too crude to be used in 
the treatment counseling of men with localized prostate cancer, as compared to a 
validated prediction model, such as the Kent model.
