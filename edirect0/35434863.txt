Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an often fatal condition, the primary 
pathology of which involves loss of pulmonary vascular perfusion due to 
progressive aberrant vessel remodeling. The reduced capacity of the pulmonary 
circulation places increasing strain on the right ventricle of the heart, 
leading to death by heart failure. Currently, licensed therapies are primarily 
vasodilators, which have increased the median post-diagnosis life expectancy 
from 2.8 to 7 years. Although this represents a substantial improvement, the 
search continues for transformative therapeutics that reverse established 
disease. The genetics of human PAH heavily implicates reduced endothelial bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling as a causal role for the disease 
pathobiology. Recent approaches have focused on directly enhancing BMP signaling 
or removing the inhibitory influence of pathways that repress BMP signaling. In 
this critical commentary, we review the evidence underpinning the development of 
two approaches: BMP-based agonists and inhibition of activin/GDF signaling. We 
also address the key considerations and questions that remain regarding these 
approaches.
