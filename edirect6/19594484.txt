dTOR (target of rapamycin) and dFoxo respond to changes in the nutritional 
environment to induce a broad range of responses in multiple tissue types. Both 
dTOR and dFoxo have been demonstrated to control the rate of age-related decline 
in cardiac function. Here, we show that the Eif4e-binding protein (d4eBP) is 
sufficient to protect long-term cardiac function against age-related decline and 
that up-regulation of dEif4e is sufficient to recapitulate the effects of high 
dTOR or insulin signaling. We also provide evidence that d4eBP acts 
tissue-autonomously and downstream of dTOR and dFoxo in the myocardium, where it 
enhances cardiac stress resistance and maintains normal heart rate and myogenic 
rhythm. Another effector of dTOR and insulin signaling, dS6K, may influence 
cardiac aging nonautonomously through its activity in the insulin-producing 
cells, possibly by regulating dilp2 expression. Thus, elevating d4eBP activity 
in cardiac tissue represents an effective organ-specific means for slowing or 
reversing cardiac functional changes brought about by normal aging.
