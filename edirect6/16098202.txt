The pathogenesis of formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) brains is unknown. One of the possibilities might be that 
translation of tau mRNA is aberrantly regulated in AD brains. In the current 
study, levels of various translation control elements including total and 
phosphorylated (p) forms of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), eukaryotic 
initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), eukaryotic elongation factor 2 
(eEF2), and eEF2 kinase were investigated in relationship with tau in 
homogenates of the medial temporal cortex from 20 AD and 10 control brains. We 
found that levels of p-mTOR (Ser2481), and p-4E-BP1 (Thr70 and Ser65) 
dramatically increase in AD, and are positively significantly correlated with 
total tau and p-tau. Levels of p-eEF2K were significantly increased, and total 
eEF2 significantly decreased in AD, when compared to controls. The changes of 
p-mTOR (2481), p-4E-BP1, and p-eEF2 were immunohistochemically confirmed to be 
in neurons of AD brains. This suggested that there are obvious abnormalities of 
elements related with translation control in AD brain and their aberrant changes 
may up-regulate the translation of tau mRNA, contributing to hyperphosphorylated 
tau accumulation in NFT-bearing neurons.
