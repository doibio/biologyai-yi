Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
recessive mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 gene that result in lysosomal 
accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in patient cells. Patient fibroblasts 
have been used for evaluation of compound efficacy, although neuronal 
degeneration is the hallmark of NPC disease. Here, we report the application of 
human NPC1 neural stem cells as a cell-based disease model to evaluate nine 
compounds that have been reported to be efficacious in the NPC1 fibroblasts and 
mouse models. These cells are differentiated from NPC1 induced pluripotent stem 
cells and exhibit a phenotype of lysosomal cholesterol accumulation. Treatment 
of these cells with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and 
δ-tocopherol significantly ameliorated the lysosomal cholesterol accumulation. 
Combined treatment with cyclodextrin and δ-tocopherol shows an additive or 
synergistic effect that otherwise requires 10-fold higher concentration of 
cyclodextrin alone. In addition, we found that hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin is 
much more potent and efficacious in the NPC1 neural stem cells compared to the 
NPC1 fibroblasts. Miglustat, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, curcumin, 
lovastatin, pravastatin, and rapamycin did not, however, have significant 
effects in these cells. The results demonstrate that patient-derived NPC1 neural 
stem cells can be used as a model system for evaluation of drug efficacy and 
study of disease pathogenesis.
