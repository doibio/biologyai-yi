BACKGROUND: Life expectancy, as well as the average age of patients undergoing 
solid organ transplantation, increases constantly. Consequently, 
immunosuppressive therapy is no longer limited to young organ recipients.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigate how different types of immunosuppressive 
therapy, namely the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and tacrolimus, as well 
as the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, affect the function of immune cells in young 
and elderly persons.
METHODS: Proliferation, cell viability, cytokine production (IL-2, IFN-γ), H2O2 
production and telomere length of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of young (n = 13; median age 27 
years) and old (n = 19; median age 71 years) healthy donors were analyzed.
RESULTS: The inhibition of proliferation was dampened in PBMCs from elderly 
donors, especially after incubation with rapamycin. All three immunosuppressive 
drugs inhibited the production of IL-2 equally well, whereas the production of 
IFN-γ was less well inhibited by rapamycin. Both calcineurin inhibitors 
increased H2O2 concentrations after stimulation with PHA and led to a shortening 
of telomeres in PBMCs from young and old individuals. Rapamycin had only minor 
effects on H2O2 production and telomere length.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the effects of immunosuppressive drugs 
on PBMCs differ between young and elderly persons. Calcineurin inhibitors 
compared to rapamycin have a more pronounced prosenescence effect. These data 
indicate that specific treatment regimens for the elderly might therefore be 
considered.
