Obesity can result in insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis, and nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) and increases liver cancer risk. Obesity-induced insulin 
resistance depends, in part, on chronic activation of mammalian target of 
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which also occurs in human and mouse 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a frequently fatal liver cancer. 
Correspondingly, mTORC1 inhibitors have been considered as potential NASH and 
HCC treatments. Using a mouse model in which high-fat diet enhances HCC 
induction by the hepatic carcinogen DEN, we examined whether mTORC1 inhibition 
attenuates liver inflammation and tumorigenesis. Notably, rapamycin treatment or 
hepatocyte-specific ablation of the specific mTORC1 subunit Raptor resulted in 
elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, activation of signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and enhanced HCC development, despite a 
transient reduction in hepatosteatosis. These results suggest that long-term 
rapamycin treatment, which also increases IL-6 production in humans, is 
unsuitable for prevention or treatment of obesity-promoted liver cancer.
