In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the control of translation is dysregulated, 
precisely, two opposite pathways: double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase 
(PKR) is up-regulated and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is 
down-regulated. These biochemical alterations were found at the periphery in 
lymphocytes of AD patients and were significantly correlated with cognitive and 
memory test scores. However, the molecular crosslink between these two opposite 
signalling pathways remains unknown. The tumour suppressor p53 and Redd1 
(regulated in development and DNA damage response) could be two downstream 
targets of active PKR to explain the breakdown of translation in AD patients. In 
this study, the protein and gene levels of p53 and Redd1 were assayed in 
lymphocytes of AD patients and in age-matched controls by Western blotting and 
RT-PCR. Furthermore, correlations were analysed with both the level of active 
PKR and the Mini Mental State Examination score (MMSE). The results show that 
the gene and protein levels of p53 and Redd1 were significantly increased about 
1.5-fold for both gene and Redd1 protein and 2.3-fold for active p53 in AD 
lymphocytes compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, statistical 
correlations between proteins and genes suggest that active PKR could 
phosphorylate p53 which could induce the transcription of Redd1 gene. No 
correlations were found between MMSE scores and levels of p53 or Redd1, contrary 
to active PKR levels. PKR represents a cognitive decline biomarker able to 
dysregulate translation via two consecutive targets p53 and Redd1 in AD 
lymphocytes.
