Rapamycin-mediated lifespan increase in mice is dose and sex dependent and 
metabolically distinct from dietary restriction.

Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR kinase, increased median lifespan of genetically 
heterogeneous mice by 23% (males) to 26% (females) when tested at a dose 
threefold higher than that used in our previous studies; maximal longevity was 
also increased in both sexes. Rapamycin increased lifespan more in females than 
in males at each dose evaluated, perhaps reflecting sexual dimorphism in blood 
levels of this drug. Some of the endocrine and metabolic changes seen in 
diet-restricted mice are not seen in mice exposed to rapamycin, and the pattern 
of expression of hepatic genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism is also quite 
distinct in rapamycin-treated and diet-restricted mice, suggesting that these 
two interventions for extending mouse lifespan differ in many respects.
