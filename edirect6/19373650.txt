Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is highly treatable with chemotherapy alone or 
combined modality therapy. High dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant 
is considered standard of care for patients who relapse. For patients who 
relapse following transplant or who are not candidates for high dose therapy, 
prognosis is poor, and new treatment strategies are needed. Targeted therapies 
for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma include monoclonal antibodies directed at cell 
surface antigens, immunoconjugates, bispecific constructs created to recruit 
host effector cells and radioimmunotherapy. In Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV)-associated Hodgkin lymphoma, cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed at EBV 
antigens have been utilised in clinical trials with some success. Additionally, 
the immunomodulatory agents thalidomide and lenalidomide, and new classes of 
drugs such as the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors and histone 
deacetylase inhibitors hold promise in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.
