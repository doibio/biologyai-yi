Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer‑related mortality in humans. The 
prognosis for advanced lung cancer patients is extremely poor. Current standard 
care is rather ineffective for prolonging patient life while preserving 
satisfactory quality of life due to adverse side-effects. Matrine extracted from 
the traditional Chinese herbal plant Sophora flavescens was shown to induce 
cancer cell death in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect 
of matrine on the proliferation and apoptosis of lung cancer cells and the 
molecular basis of matrine-induced apoptosis. The results showed that matrine 
inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in lung cancer A549 and 95D 
cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The apoptotic effects of matrine on 
lung cancer cells appeared to act via the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) 
signaling pathway and downregulation of the expression of the inhibitor of 
apoptosis protein (IAP) family proteins. Matrine exerts its cancer-killing 
effect via promoting apoptosis in lung cancer cells and may be a useful adjuvant 
therapeutic scheme for treating advanced lung cancer patients.
