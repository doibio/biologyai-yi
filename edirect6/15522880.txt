Depending on the type of external signals, T cells can initiate multiple 
intracellular signaling pathways that can be broadly classified into two groups 
based on their sensitivity to the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). 
Interleukin (IL)-12-mediated interferon (IFN)-gamma production by activated T 
cells has been shown to be CsA-insensitive. In this report, we demonstrate that 
the IL-12-induced CsA-resistant pathway of IFN-gamma production is sensitive to 
rapamycin. Rapamycin treatment resulted in the aberrant recruitment of Stat3, 
Stat4, and phospho-c-Jun to the genomic promoter region resulting in decreased 
IFN-gamma transcription. IL-12-induced phosphorylation of Stat3 on Ser-727 was 
affected by rapamycin, which may be due to the effect of rapamycin on the 
IL-12-induced interaction between mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and 
Stat3. In accordance with this, reduction in the mTOR protein level by small 
interfering RNA resulted in suppression of Stat3 phosphorylation and decreased 
production of IFN-gamma after IL-12 stimulation. These results suggest that mTOR 
may play a major role in IL-12-induced IFN-gamma production by activated T 
cells.
