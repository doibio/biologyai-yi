Work in yeast has shown that longevity extension induced by nutrient 
deprivation, altered ribosomal function, or diminished target of rapamycin 
action requires the activity of GCN4. We hypothesized that increased activity of 
ATF4, the mammalian equivalent of yeast GCN4, might be characteristic of 
mutations that extend mouse life span. Fibroblasts from the skin of two such 
mutants (Snell dwarf and PAPP-A knockout) were found to have higher levels of 
ATF4 protein and expression of several ATF4 target genes in responses to amino 
acid withdrawal, cadmium, hydrogen peroxide, and tunicamycin. ATF4 pathways were 
also elevated in liver of both kinds of long-lived mutant mice. Thus, a 
connection between ATF4 pathways and longevity may have deep evolutionary roots, 
and further studies of ATF4 mechanisms may provide insights into the links 
between cellular stress resistance, protein translation control, and aging.
