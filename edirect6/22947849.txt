The fungicide rapamycin increases lifespan in eukaryotes by interfering with the 
activity of a serine/threonine kinase called TOR (target of rapamycin). TOR 
complex 1 (TORC1) is an essential integrator of cellular nutrient cues, growth 
signals and cellular metabolism. Here, we review major components of TORC1, its 
downstream effectors and lifespan studies in various organisms involving these 
signaling components. In particular, we focus on the role of rapamycin in 
mitochondrial biogenesis, in metabolic regulation and in the control of reactive 
oxygen species production.
