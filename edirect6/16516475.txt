The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a serine/threonine kinase of the 
phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase family and is highly conserved from 
yeast to mammals. TOR functions as a central regulator of cell growth and is 
itself regulated by a wide range of signals, including growth factors, nutrients 
and stress conditions. Recent studies in eukaryotic cells have identified two 
distinct TOR complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, which phosphorylate different 
substrates and have distinct physiological functions. Here, we discuss new 
findings that have extended the complexity of TOR signaling and the different 
roles of the TORC complexes in yeast, flies and mammals.
