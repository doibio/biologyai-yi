BACKGROUND: To elucidate whether rapamycin, the inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian 
target of rapamycin), can potentiate the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel in lung 
cancer cells and to probe the mechanism underlying such enhancement.
METHODS: Lung cancer cells were treated with docetaxel and rapamycin. The effect 
on the proliferation of lung cancer cells was evaluated using the MTT method, 
and cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Protein expression and level 
of phosphorylation were assayed using Western Blot method.
RESULTS: Co-treatment of rapamycin and docetaxel was found to favorably enhance 
the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel in four lung cancer cell lines. This 
tumoricidal boost is associated with a reduction in the expression and 
phosphorylation levels of Survivin and ERK1/2, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The combined application of mTOR inhibitor and docetaxel led to a 
greater degree of cancer cell killing than that by either compound used alone. 
Therefore, this combination warrants further investigation in its suitability of 
serving as a novel therapeutic scheme for treating advanced and recurrent lung 
cancer patients.
