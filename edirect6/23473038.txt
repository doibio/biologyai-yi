The evolutionarily conserved target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling controls 
growth, metabolism, and aging. In the first robust demonstration of 
pharmacologically-induced life extension in mammals, longevity was extended in 
mice treated with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic TOR (mTOR). However, 
detrimental metabolic effects of rapamycin treatment were also reported, 
presenting a paradox of improved survival despite metabolic impairment. How 
rapamycin extended lifespan in mice with such paradoxical effects was unclear. 
Here we show that detrimental effects of rapamycin treatment were only observed 
during the early stages of treatment. These effects were reversed or diminished 
in mice treated for 20 weeks, with better metabolic profiles, increased oxygen 
consumption and ketogenesis, and markedly enhanced insulin sensitivity. Thus, 
prolonged rapamycin treatment lead to beneficial metabolic alterations, 
consistent with life extension previously observed. Our findings provide a 
likely explanation of the "rapamycin paradox" and support the potential causal 
importance of these metabolic alterations in longevity.
