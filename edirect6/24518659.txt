BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is a major risk factor for cardiovascular 
diseases. Osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) 
is a key step in vascular calcification, but the molecular mechanisms driving 
the differentiation remain elusive. In this study, the involvement of mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling in osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs 
is investigated.
METHODS: Calcification of VSMCs was induced in vitro using β-glycerophosphate 
(β-GP). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure messenger RNA 
(mRNA) expression, and Western blot was used to detect protein expression. 
Inhibition of mTOR expression was established by small interfering RNA (siRNA) 
and mTOR inhibitors.
RESULTS: The model for osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs was established 
in vitro by treating mouse VSMCs with 10 mM β-GP for 3-15 days. Overexpression 
of mTOR was observed in differentiated VSMCs. Downregulation of mTOR by siRNA or 
rapamycin significantly inhibited osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs and 
decreased the expression and phosphorylation of mTOR and P70 ribosomal S6 kinase 
in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, adiponectin 
inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of mTOR in β-GP-treated VSMCs in a 
time- and concentration-dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: mTOR signalling plays a crucial role in the osteoblastic 
differentiation of VSMCs. Rapamycin and adiponectin might inhibit vascular 
calcification through regulation of the mTOR pathway.
