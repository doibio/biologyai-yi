Akt, also known as protein kinase B, plays key roles in cell proliferation, 
survival and metabolism. Akt hyperactivation contributes to many 
pathophysiological conditions, including human cancers, and is closely 
associated with poor prognosis and chemo- or radiotherapeutic resistance. 
Phosphorylation of Akt at S473 (ref. 5) and T308 (ref. 6) activates Akt. 
However, it remains unclear whether further mechanisms account for full Akt 
activation, and whether Akt hyperactivation is linked to misregulated cell cycle 
progression, another cancer hallmark. Here we report that Akt activity 
fluctuates across the cell cycle, mirroring cyclin A expression. 
Mechanistically, phosphorylation of S477 and T479 at the Akt extreme carboxy 
terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2)/cyclin A or mTORC2, under distinct 
physiological conditions, promotes Akt activation through facilitating, or 
functionally compensating for, S473 phosphorylation. Furthermore, deletion of 
the cyclin A2 allele in the mouse olfactory bulb leads to reduced S477/T479 
phosphorylation and elevated cellular apoptosis. Notably, cyclin 
A2-deletion-induced cellular apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells is partly 
rescued by S477D/T479E-Akt1, supporting a physiological role for cyclin A2 in 
governing Akt activation. Together, the results of our study show Akt S477/T479 
phosphorylation to be an essential layer of the Akt activation mechanism to 
regulate its physiological functions, thereby providing a new mechanistic link 
between aberrant cell cycle progression and Akt hyperactivation in cancer.
