To clarify the mechanism of VEGF release in osteoblasts, we studied whether p70 
S6 kinase is involved in basic FGF-2-stimulated VEGF release in osteoblast-like 
MC3T3-E1 cells. In this study, we show that p70 S6 kinase activated by FGF-2 
negatively regulates VEGF release through SAPK/JNK in osteoblasts.
INTRODUCTION: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role 
in bone metabolism. We have previously reported that fibroblast growth factor-2 
(FGF-2) stimulates the release of VEGF through p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein 
(MAP) kinase and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 
(SAPK/JNK) in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells and that FGF-2-activated p38 MAP 
kinase negatively regulates VEGF release. However, the mechanism behind VEGF 
release in osteoblasts is not precisely known.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The levels of VEGF released from MC3T3-E1 cells were 
measured by enzyme immunoassay. The phosphorylation of each protein kinase was 
analyzed by Western blotting. To knock down p70 S6 kinase in MC3T3-E1 cells, the 
cells were transfected with siRNA to target p70 S6 kinase.
RESULTS: FGF-2 time-dependently induced the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase. 
Rapamycin significantly enhanced the FGF-2-stimulated VEGF release and VEGF mRNA 
expression. The FGF-2-induced phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase was suppressed by 
rapamycin. Rapamycin markedly enhanced the FGF-2-induced phosphorylation of 
SAPK/JNK without affecting the phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase or p38 MAP 
kinase. SP600125, a specific inhibitor of SAPK/JNK, suppressed the amplification 
by rapamycin of the FGF-2-stimulated VEGF release similar to the levels of FGF-2 
with SP600125. Finally, downregulation of p70 S6 kinase by siRNA significantly 
enhanced the FGF-2-stimulated VEGF release and phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK.
CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that p70 S6 kinase limits 
FGF-2-stimulated VEGF release through self-regulation of SAPK/JNK, composing a 
negative feedback loop, in osteoblasts.
