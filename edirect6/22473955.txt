Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a devastating autosomal recessive disease 
characterized by neurodegeneration, cachexia, and accelerated aging. 80% of the 
cases are caused by mutations in the CS complementation group B (CSB) gene known 
to be involved in DNA repair and transcription. Recent evidence indicates that 
CSB is present in mitochondria, where it associates with mitochondrial DNA 
(mtDNA). We report an increase in metabolism in the CSB(m/m) mouse model and 
CSB-deficient cells. Mitochondrial content is increased in CSB-deficient cells, 
whereas autophagy is down-regulated, presumably as a result of defects in the 
recruitment of P62 and mitochondrial ubiquitination. CSB-deficient cells show 
increased free radical production and an accumulation of damaged mitochondria. 
Accordingly, treatment with the autophagic stimulators lithium chloride or 
rapamycin reverses the bioenergetic phenotype of CSB-deficient cells. Our data 
imply that CSB acts as an mtDNA damage sensor, inducing mitochondrial autophagy 
in response to stress, and that pharmacological modulators of autophagy are 
potential treatment options for this accelerated aging phenotype.
