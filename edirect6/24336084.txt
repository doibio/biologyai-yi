This article is addressed to endocrinologists treating patients with diabetic 
complications as well as to basic scientists studying an elusive link between 
diseases and aging. It answers some challenging questions. What is the link 
between insulin resistance (IR), cellular aging and diseases? Why complications 
such as retinopathy may paradoxically precede the onset of type II diabetes. Why 
intensive insulin therapy may initially worsen retinopathy. How nutrient- and 
insulin-sensing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway can drive insulin 
resistance and diabetic complications. And how rapamycin, at rational doses and 
schedules, may prevent IR, retinopathy, nephropathy and beta-cell failure, 
without causing side effects.
