Hyperphosphorylated neurofilaments are a part of neurofibrillary tangles in 
Alzheimer's disease brains. Zinc has been shown to be increased in the brain 
areas heavily affected by Alzheimer pathologies. Zinc could induce tau 
hyperphosphorylation in SH-SY5Y and N2a cells, and tau phosphorylation may be 
mediated by p70 S6 kinase activation. Many of the tau kinases can also 
phosphorylate neurofilaments, and in this study we wanted to see whether 
neurofilament phosphorylation is regulated by p70 S6 kinase in N2a cells. We 
found that zinc induces rapamycin-dependent p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation at 
Thr421/Ser424 and Thr389, and rapamycin-independent phosphorylation of 
neurofilaments at the SMI34 epitope. Although zinc could induce cell 
proliferation and cell growth, and increased phosphorylation of neurofilaments, 
only cell growth appeared to be related to p7056kinase activation.
