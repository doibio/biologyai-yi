During aging there is an increasing imbalance of energy intake and expenditure 
resulting in obesity, frailty, and metabolic disorders. For decades, research 
has shown that caloric restriction (CR) and exercise can postpone detrimental 
aspects of aging. These two interventions invoke a similar physiological 
signature involving pathways associated with stress responses and mitochondrial 
homeostasis. Nonetheless, CR is able to delay aging processes that result in an 
increase of both mean and maximum lifespan, whereas exercise primarily increases 
healthspan. Due to the strict dietary regime necessary to achieve the beneficial 
effects of CR, most studies to date have focused on rodents and non-human 
primates. As a consequence, there is vast interest in the development of 
compounds such as resveratrol, metformin and rapamycin that would activate the 
same metabolic- and stress-response pathways induced by these interventions 
without actually restricting caloric intake. Therefore the scope of this review 
is to (i) describe the benefits of CR and exercise in healthy individuals, (ii) 
discuss the role of these interventions in the diseased state, and (iii) examine 
some of the promising pharmacological alternatives such as CR- and 
exercise-mimetics.
