This article discusses that the traditional analogy of an aging organism with a 
rusting (albeit self-repairing) car is misleading. The true analogy is a 
speeding car that enters a low-speed zone and damages itself because it does not 
and cannot slow down. For such a car without brakes (and actually without a 
driver), aging from rusting never occurs. Using simple analogies (although 
turning gerontology upside down), this article discusses the origin of aging, 
how overactivation of the mTOR (Target of Rapamycin) pathway causes aging, why 
aging causes damage (organ damage) not damage causes aging, the link between 
aging and age-related diseases, slow aging versus aging tolerance and 
suppression of aging with rapamycin.
