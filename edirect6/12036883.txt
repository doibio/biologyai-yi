The consequences of T-cell activation depend exclusively on costimulation during 
antigen-T-cell receptor interaction. Interaction between the T-cell coreceptor 
CD28 and its ligand B7 during antigen-antigen receptor engagement results in 
full activation of T cells, the outcomes of which are proliferation and effector 
functions. The ability of CD28 to costimulate the production of interleukin-2 
(IL-2) explains the importance of this costimulation. The signaling event 
mediated by CD28 engagement has been proposed to have 2 components: one is 
sensitive to the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA), and the other one 
is CsA-resistant. In this report, we demonstrate that the CsA-resistant pathway 
is sensitive to the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin. Treatment with rapamycin 
blocked IL-2 production after activation of human peripheral blood T cells with 
phorbol ester (PMA) and anti-CD28 (CsA-resistant pathway), whereas this drug did 
not have any effect on PMA plus ionomycin stimulation (CsA-sensitive pathway). 
The inhibitory effect of rapamycin was on messenger RNA stability and 
translation, rather than on IL-2 transcription or protein turnover.
