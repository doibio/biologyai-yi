Although we do not know everything about aging, we now know enough to start its 
pharmacologic suppression using clinically approved drugs. Aging turns out to be 
driven by sensing-signaling pathways (such as the mTOR pathway). Given that some 
inhibitors of the mTOR pathway are already in clinical use, there is a unique 
opportunity to suppress aging, while treating and preventing diseases. By itself 
this will answer some burning questions in gerontology. Here I discuss a 
proposal, starting from retrospective clinical studies to animal and cellular 
models to drug screens in order to develop non-toxic and effective schedules and 
drug combinations for extending healthy life span in our lifetime.
