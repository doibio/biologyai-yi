Life span can be extended in rodents by restricting food availability (caloric 
restriction [CR]) or by providing food low in methionine (Meth-R). Here, we show 
that a period of food restriction limited to the first 20 days of life, via a 
50% enlargement of litter size, shows extended median and maximal life span 
relative to mice from normal sized litters and that a Meth-R diet initiated at 
12 months of age also significantly increases longevity. Furthermore, mice 
exposed to a CR diet show changes in liver messenger RNA patterns, in 
phosphorylation of Erk, Jnk2, and p38 kinases, and in phosphorylation of 
mammalian target of rapamycin and its substrate 4EBP1, HE-binding protein 1 that 
are not observed in liver from age-matched Meth-R mice. These results introduce 
new protocols that can increase maximal life span and suggest that the spectrum 
of metabolic changes induced by low-calorie and low-methionine diets may differ 
in instructive ways.
