The incidence and mortality rates of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been 
increasing annually due to obesity and environmental pollution. Although 
immunotherapy of RCC has been studied for decades, few comprehensive 
bibliometric analyses exist on the treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this 
bibliometric analysis was to identify scientific achievements of the global 
research on RCC immunotherapy from 2003 to 2022 and discuss research trends. 
Data were retrieved from the Clarivate Web of Science Core Collection using a 
set retrieval strategy. The Bibliometrics tool Cite Space 6.2 R2 (Chaomei Chen, 
Drexel University) was used to analyze 4,841 articles. The USA had the most 
publications (n = 1,864); Harvard University was identified as the leading 
institution (n = 264); and Dr. Toni K. Choueiri, was the most productive 
researcher in the field (n = 55). Keyword analysis showed that nivolumab, immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, tumor microenvironment, everolimus, cabozantinib, 
resistance, pembrolizumab and ipilimumab were the main hotspots and frontier 
directions of RCC. By analyzing the results of bibliometrics, national and 
international researchers can better understand the current research status of 
RCC immunotherapy and identify new directions for future research. However, the 
analysis also identified pockets of insularity, highlighting a need for greater 
collaboration and cooperation among researchers to advance the field of RCC 
immunotherapy.
