The senescence of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) drives the occurrence and 
development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Homocysteine (HCY) is a general 
risk factor for age-associated CVDs. Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved 
lysosomal protein degradation pathway, serves a part in VEC senescence. The 
purpose of this study was to investigate the role of autophagy in HCY-induced 
endothelial cell senescence and explore novel mechanisms and therapeutic 
approaches for related CVDs. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) 
were isolated from fresh umbilical cords of healthy pregnancies. Cell Counting 
Kit-8, flow cytometry and senescence-associated (SA) β-galactosidase (Gal) 
staining demonstrated that HCY induced HUVEC senescence by decreasing cell 
proliferation, arresting cell cycle and increasing the number of 
SA-β-Gal-positive cells. Stub-RFP-Sens-GFP-LC3 autophagy-related double 
fluorescence lentivirus revealed that HCY increased autophagic flux. Further, 
inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine increased HCY-induced HUVEC 
senescence. By contrast, the induction of autophagy via rapamycin alleviated 
HCY-induced HUVEC senescence. Finally, the detection of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) with ROS kit showed that HCY increased intracellular ROS, whereas 
induction of autophagy reduced intracellular ROS. In conclusion, HCY increased 
HUVEC senescence and upregulated autophagy; moderate autophagy could reverse 
HCY-induced cell senescence. Autophagy may alleviate HCY-induced cell senescence 
by decreasing intracellular ROS. This provides insight into the underlying 
mechanism of HCY-induced VEC senescence and potential treatments for 
age-associated CVDs.
