BACKGROUND: The mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway is a complex 
signaling cascade that regulates cellular growth, proliferation, metabolism, and 
survival. Although activation of mTOR signaling has been linked to 
atherosclerosis, its direct role in lesion progression and in plaque macrophages 
remains poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that mTORC1 (mTOR complex 
1) activation promotes atherogenesis through inhibition of autophagy and 
increased apoptosis in macrophages.
METHODS: Using macrophage-specific Rictor- and mTOR-deficient mice, we now 
dissect the distinct functions of mTORC2 pathways in atherogenesis.
RESULTS: In contrast to the atheroprotective effect seen with blockade of 
macrophage mTORC1, macrophage-specific mTORC2-deficient mice exhibit an 
atherogenic phenotype, with larger, more complex lesions and increased cell 
death. In cultured macrophages, we show that mTORC2 signaling inhibits the FoxO1 
(forkhead box protein O1) transcription factor, leading to suppression of 
proinflammatory pathways, especially the inflammasome/IL (interleukin)-1β 
response, a key mediator of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. In 
addition, administration of FoxO1 inhibitors efficiently rescued the 
proinflammatory response caused by mTORC2 deficiency both in vitro and in vivo. 
Interestingly, collective deletion of macrophage mTOR, which ablates mTORC1- and 
mTORC2-dependent pathways, leads to minimal change in plaque size or complexity, 
reflecting the balanced yet opposing roles of these signaling arms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the first mechanistic details of macrophage mTOR 
signaling in atherosclerosis and suggest that therapeutic measures aimed at 
modulating mTOR need to account for its dichotomous functions.
