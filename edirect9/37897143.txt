BACKGROUND: Previous data from a 2-year randomized controlled trial 
(CRAD001ADE12) indicated that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition by 
everolimus slowed cyst growth in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic 
kidney disease (ADPKD). During the trial, we noted body weight loss in some 
patients, particularly in women. We hypothesized that everolimus causes body 
weight reduction by reduced food intake and/or metabolic changes, which could 
lead to cachexia.
METHODS: Within a sub-analysis of the CRAD001ADE12 trial, body weight course was 
investigated regarding sex-specific differences in 433 adult ADPKD patients 
(everolimus, n = 215; placebo, n = 218). One hundred four out of 111 patients 
who participated in the clinical trial centre in Berlin were evaluated under 
everolimus/placebo therapy (on drug: everolimus, n = 48; placebo, n = 56) and 
after therapy (off drug: everolimus, n = 15; placebo, n = 18). Eating habits and 
nutrient/caloric intake were evaluated by validated questionnaires. Systemic and 
local metabolism was evaluated in four patients after an oral glucose load (OGL) 
by using calorimetry and adipose/muscle tissue microdialysis.
RESULTS: Within the 2-year CRAD001ADE12 trial, a significant body weight loss 
was observed in female patients on everolimus versus placebo (P = 0.0029). Data 
of the Berlin Cohort revealed that weight loss was greater in women on 
everolimus versus men (P < 0.01). After 9 months, women and men had lost 
2.6 ± 3.8 and 0.8 ± 1.5 kg (P < 0.05) in body weight, respectively, and after 
21 months, they had lost 4.1 ± 6.6 and 1.0 ± 3.3 kg (P < 0.05), respectively. On 
everolimus, caloric intake was significantly lower in women versus men 
(1510 ± 128 vs. 2264 ± 216 kcal/day, P < 0.05), caused mainly by a lower fat and 
protein intake in women versus men. Cognitive restraints, disinhibition and 
hunger remained unchanged. In a subgroup of patients resting metabolic rate was 
unchanged whereas OGL-induced thermogenesis was reduced (7 ± 2 vs. 11 ± 2 kcal, 
P < 0.05). Fasting and OGL-induced fat oxidation was increased (P < 0.05) on 
versus off everolimus. In adipose tissue, fasting lipolytic activity was 
increased, but lipolytic activity was inhibited similarly after the OGL on 
versus off everolimus, respectively. In skeletal muscle, postprandial glucose 
uptake and aerobic glycolysis was reduced in patients on everolimus.
CONCLUSIONS: mTOR inhibition by everolimus induces body weight reduction, 
specifically in female patients. This effect is possibly caused by a centrally 
mediated reduced food (fat and protein) intake and by centrally/peripherally 
mediated increased fat oxidation (systemic) and mobilization (adipose tissue). 
Glucose uptake and oxidation might be reduced in skeletal muscle. This could 
lead to cachexia and, possibly, muscle wasting. Therefore, our results have 
important implications for patients recieving immune-suppressive 
mTOR inhibition therapy.
