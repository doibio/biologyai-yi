L-type voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels (L-VGCC) dysfunction is implicated 
in several neurological and psychiatric diseases. While a popular therapeutic 
target, it is unknown whether molecular mechanisms leading to disrupted L-VGCC 
across neurodegenerative disorders are conserved. Importantly, L-VGCC integrate 
synaptic signals to facilitate a plethora of cellular mechanisms; however, 
mechanisms that regulate L-VGCC channel density and subcellular 
compartmentalization are understudied. Herein, we report that in disease models 
with overactive mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling (or 
mTORopathies), deficits in dendritic L-VGCC activity are associated with 
increased expression of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Parkinsonism-associated 
deglycase (DJ-1). DJ-1 binds the mRNA coding for the alpha and auxiliary Ca2+ 
channel subunits CaV1.2 and α2δ2, and represses their mRNA translation, only in 
the disease states, specifically preclinical models of tuberous sclerosis 
complex (TSC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In agreement, DJ-1-mediated 
repression of CaV1.2/α2δ2 protein synthesis in dendrites is exaggerated in mouse 
models of AD and TSC, resulting in deficits in dendritic L-VGCC calcium 
activity. Finding of DJ-1-regulated L-VGCC activity in dendrites in TSC and AD 
provides a unique signaling pathway that can be targeted in clinical 
mTORopathies.
