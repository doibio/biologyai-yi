BACKGROUND: Non-involuting congenital hemangiomas (NICHs) are fully formed 
vascular tumors at birth with distinctive clinical, radiologic, and 
histopathological profiles. In the literature, there is no effective therapy 
strategy for patients with NICH except surgery. Currently, no cell line or 
animal model exists for studying the mechanism of NICH and drug validation. We 
plan to construct a new strategy by constructing NICH organoids for further 
study.
RESULT: Here, we report a novel NICH organoid system construction and 
optimization process. Both HE and immunohistological staining exactly matched 
NICH tissue. We further performed transcriptome analysis to elucidate the 
characteristics of NICH organoids. Both NICH tissue and NICH organoids 
manifested similar trends in download sites. NICH organoids display novel 
features to new cells derived from organoids and show spectacular multiplication 
capacity. In the preliminary verification, we found that cells splitting from 
NICH organoids were human endothelial cells. Drug validation demonstrated that 
trametinib, sirolimus, and propranolol showed no inhibitory effects on NICH 
organoids.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that this new NICH-derived organoid faithfully 
captured the features of this rare vascular tumor. Our study will boost further 
research on the mechanism of NICH and drug filtering in the future.
