Werner syndrome (WS) is a hereditary premature aging disorder characterized by 
visceral fat accumulation and subcutaneous lipoatrophy, resulting in severe 
insulin resistance. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this 
study, we show that senescence-associated inflammation and suppressed 
adipogenesis play a role in subcutaneous adipose tissue reduction and 
dysfunction in WS. Clinical data from four Japanese patients with WS revealed 
significant associations between the decrease of areas of subcutaneous fat and 
increased insulin resistance measured by the glucose clamp. Adipose-derived stem 
cells from the stromal vascular fraction derived from WS subcutaneous adipose 
tissues (WSVF) showed early replicative senescence and a significant increase in 
the expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) markers. 
Additionally, adipogenesis and insulin signaling were suppressed in WSVF, and 
the expression of adipogenesis suppressor genes and SASP-related genes was 
increased. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), 
alleviated premature cellular senescence, rescued the decrease in insulin 
signaling, and extended the lifespan of WS model of C. elegans. To the best of 
our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal the critical role of cellular 
senescence in subcutaneous lipoatrophy and severe insulin resistance in WS, 
highlighting the therapeutic potential of rapamycin for this disease.
