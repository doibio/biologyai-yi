Context: Alzheimer's disease is strongly associated with brain insulin 
signalling.Objective: Investigating the effect of amylin as a novel treatment in 
streptozotocin (STZ) rat model of AD.Materials and methods: Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) was induced in albino rats by intracerebroventricular injection of STZ 
(3 mg/kg). Rats received either amylin analogue (Pramlintide 200 μg/kg/day) or 
Metformin (30 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks.Results: Both Pramlintide and Metformin 
improve learning and memory through enhancing insulin signalling (p-IR and 
p-PI3K) which lead to lowering level of CSF glucose, phosphorylated tau 
proteins, and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in hippocampus.Conclusions: Insulin 
sensitisers as Metformin and Pramlintide can improve learning and memory and 
decrease the pathological changes in STZ induced rat model of AD. However, 
Pramlintide is superior to Metformin in some memory tests which related to its 
action as an amylin analogue. Amylin improves learning and memory through an 
independent effect other than insulin sensitisation.
