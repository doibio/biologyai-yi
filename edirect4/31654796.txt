ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Seven traditional medicinal plants (including 
Astragalus membranaceus, Dioscorea hemsleyi, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Scrophularia 
ningpoensis, Ophiopogon japonicus, Panax ginseng and Fritillariae cirrhosae) and 
one insect leech (Whitmania pigra Whitman) were combined into BuZangTongLuo 
formula (BZTLF) under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine. BZTLF is 
potentially effective against diabetic vascular complications.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Previous studies failed to clarify the molecular mechanism 
through which BZTLF suppressed diabetic ischemia. In this study, we aimed to 
explore whether BZTLF treatment could prevent the occurrence of type 2 diabetic 
(T2D) hindlimb ischemia in mice. Further, we investigated the regulatory effect 
of BZTLF on angiogenesis-related VEGF signaling pathway and gut microbiota 
dysfunction in diabetic ischemia mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6J mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) received STZ 
injection and femoral artery ligation to build T2D diabetic hindlimb ischemia 
model. Mice were gavaged with BZTLF (5 g [raw materials]/kg/d) or with metformin 
plus atorvastatin for three weeks. Laser doppler imaging system was utilized for 
the visualization of blood flow. Histochemistry analysis was performed for 
microvascular vessel staining. Western blot was applied to detect the protein 
changes of signaling molecules responsible for VEGF pathway. Finally, 16S rDNA 
gene sequencing was conducted for analysis of gut microbiota structure.
RESULTS: BZTLF treatment remarkably restored blood flow and capillary density of 
diabetic hindlimb ischemia. And the protein changes of VEGF signaling molecules 
were reversed in BZTLF-treated diabetic ischemia mice, including the decreased 
VEGF and HIF-1α, and the increased NO, eNOS and p-ERK1/2. The gut microbiota 
analysis suggests that BZTLF treatment increased the abundances of several 
beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides), while 
decreased the populations of some harmful bacteria(Blautia, Weissella, 
Escherichia Shigella and Kurthia). By using Spearman's correlation analysis, 
these changed gut flora were positively/negatively correlated with VEGF 
signaling pathway or glycometabolic parameters.
CONCLUSION: BZTLF displayed beneficial effects on diabetic hindlimb ischemia by 
reshaping the gut microbiota structure and stunning the VEGF/HIF-1α pathway.
