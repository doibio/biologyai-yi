AIM: To determine the patterns and predictors of pharmacological treatment 
initiation for type 2 diabetes and whether treatment initiation is consistent 
with Australian clinical practice guidelines that recommend metformin 
monotherapy.
METHODS: Individuals aged 40-99 years initiating a non-insulin type 2 diabetes 
medication between July 2013 and February 2018 were identified from a 10% random 
national sample of pharmacy dispensing data. Logistic regression was used to 
estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the predictors 
of initiating sulfonylurea monotherapy, non-guideline monotherapy and 
combination therapy compared with metformin monotherapy. Predictors included 
age, sex, initiation year and comorbidities determined using the Rx-Risk 
comorbidity index.
RESULTS: Of the 47 860 initiators, [47% women, mean age 60.7 (sd 12.1) years], 
85.8%, 4.6%, 1.9% and 7.7% received metformin monotherapy, sulfonylurea 
monotherapy, non-guideline monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively. 
Increasing age was associated with increasing odds of initiating sulfonylurea 
monotherapy and non-guideline monotherapy. Combination therapy initiation was 
less likely in women (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.79) and people with more 
comorbidities (e.g. OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.29-0.44 for seven or more comorbidities 
vs. no comorbidities) but more likely in congestive heart failure (OR 1.42, 95% 
CI 1.22-1.65), cerebrovascular disease (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.32-1.69) and 
dyslipidaemia (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.40).
CONCLUSION: Treatment initiation in Australia is largely consistent with 
clinical practice guidelines, with 86% of individuals initiating metformin 
monotherapy. Initiation on combination therapy was more common in men and in 
those with fewer comorbidities.
