Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease, which is 
characterized by the progressive deterioration in lung function. In the 
pathogenesis of IPF, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has been found to be 
heavily involved. Metformin, a commonly used oral antidiabetic agent, is known 
to inhibit IGF-1 by the reversal of hyperinsulinemia. In this study, we 
evaluated the effects of metformin in pulmonary fibrosis in C57/BL6J mice, and 
further understand the role of IGF-1 signaling pathway involving in this 
process. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced experimentally in these mice by the 
intratracheal injection of bleomycin (BLM). Metformin was given orally the day 
before or 14 days after bleomycin injection, while pirfenidone was used as the 
positive control. Our study showed that intratracheal injection of bleomycin 
induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, with observed elevation in collagen, 
fibronectin and α-SMA level, characterized by the enhanced IGF-1 and PI3K 
expression. Metformin was able to inhibit these effects significantly, and its 
antifibrotic effect had no marked difference with pirfenidone. Our results show 
that metformin attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via IGF-1 
pathway.
