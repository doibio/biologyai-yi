AIMS: To determine which drugs were selected to be added to metformin for 
patients on dual anti-diabetic medication in the management of type 2 diabetes 
and to assess HbA1c and BMI outcomes at 6 and 12 months after the initiation of 
a second anti-diabetic medication.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of electronic medical record data. Second 
line anti-diabetic medication added to metformin between 7/1/2012 to 8/31/2017 
in the primary care practice in Fairview Health System in Minnesota.
RESULTS: 3413 patients met the selection criteria of type 2 diabetes, 18 years 
and older, dual anti-diabetes therapy with metformin being the first prescribed. 
The most frequently prescribed medications added to metformin were sulfonylurea 
and basal insulin accounting for 51% (1724/3413) and 37% (1268/3413) 
respectively. Mean HbA1c reductions at 6 and 12 months among 2134 patients with 
baseline and follow-up HbA1c data respectively were: GLP-1 agonist (-1.3, 
P < 0.001; -1.2, P < 0.001), sulfonylurea (-1.1, P < 0.001; -0.9, P < 0.001), 
basal insulin (-1.1, P < 0.001; -1.0, P < 0.001), DPP4 inhibitor (-0.7, 
P = 0.223; -0.8, P = 0.049). Patients prescribed a GLP-1 agonist had a higher 
mean baseline BMI (BMI =40.3 kg/m2) and this was the only group with a 
statistically significant BMI reduction from baseline at 6 and 12 months (-1.5, 
P = 0.049 and -1.8, P = 0.041).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Type 2 diabetes patients treated with sulfonylurea, 
basal insulin and GLP-1 agonist as an add on to metformin had significant 
reductions in HbA1c. Patients prescribed a GLP-1 agonist had a significant BMI 
reduction.
