Doxorubicin (DOX) is an antineoplastic agent obtained from Streptomyces 
peucetius. It is utilized in treating different kinds of cancers, such as 
leukemia, lymphoma, and lung, and breast cancers. The main side effect of DOX is 
cardiotoxicity. Metformin (MET) is an antihyperglycemic drug used for type 2 
diabetes treatment. It is proposed that MET has a protective effect against DOX 
cardiotoxicity. Our review demonstrated that MET has several possible mechanisms 
of action, which can prevent or at least reduce DOX cardiotoxicity including a 
decrease of free radical generation and oxidative stress, 5' adenosine 
monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation, and ferritin heavy chain 
expression in cardiomyocytes cells. The combination of MET and DOX has been 
shown to enhance the anticancer activity of DOX by a number of authors. The 
literature reviewed in the present report supports the hypothesis that MET can 
reduce the cardiotoxicity that often occurs with DOX treatment.
