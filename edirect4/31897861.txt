Metformin is the safest and the most widely prescribed first-line therapy for 
managing hyperglycemia due to different underlying causes, primarily type 2 
diabetes mellitus. In addition to its euglycemic properties, metformin has 
stimulated a wave of clinical trials to investigate benefits on aging-related 
diseases and longevity. Such an impact on the lifespan extension would 
undoubtedly expand the therapeutic utility of metformin regardless of glycemic 
status. However, there is a scarcity of studies evaluating whether metformin has 
differential cognitive effects across age, sex, glycemic status, metformin dose, 
and duration of metformin treatment and associated pathological conditions. By 
scrutinizing the available literature on animal and human studies for metformin 
and brain function, we expect to shed light on the potential impact of metformin 
on cognition across age, sex, and pathological conditions. This review aims to 
provide readers with a broader insight of (a) how metformin differentially 
affects cognition and (b) why there is a need for more translational and 
clinical studies examining multifactorial interactions. The outcomes of such 
comprehensive studies will streamline precision medicine practices, avoiding 
"fit for all" approach, and optimizing metformin use for longevity benefit 
irrespective of hyperglycemia.
