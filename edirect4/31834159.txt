OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of metformin on marrow adiposity in 
postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: We enrolled 25 postmenopausal T2DM women who satisfied the requirement 
of having been on 1 year of metformin therapy and 26 age-matched healthy women 
receiving a placebo. All participants were analyzed for marrow fat fraction (FF) 
by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, vertebral volumetric bone mineral density 
(vBMD) by quantitative computed tomography, blood glucose, lipid profiles, and 
bone biomarkers to compare values before and after the interventions. 
Differences between groups were assessed using a Student's t test and chi-square 
test or an analysis of covariance adjusted for covariates. Twelve-month change 
in within-group difference was assessed using paired t tests. Correlations were 
determined by Pearson's correlation.
RESULTS: Vertebral vBMD was lower in T2DM than in nondiabetic controls 
(105.6 ± 13.8 vs 112.8 ± 15.2 mg/cm; P = 0.029). T2DM women had a higher marrow 
FF than those without diabetes (66.3 ± 7.2% vs 58.9 ± 7.5%; P < 0.001), even 
after adjusting for covariates. From baseline to month 12 in the T2DM group, 
metformin was associated with a reduction in marrow FF (-12.0%; P < 0.001) and 
an increase in vBMD (3.7%; P = 0.020). For metformin-treated T2DM women, the 
12-month change in marrow FF was inversely associated with change in vBMD 
(r = -0.771, P < 0.001), but not with changes in bone biomarkers, whereas change 
in vBMD or FF was not significant in the control group.
CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed T2DM have a higher marrow 
fat content compared with nondiabetic women. Metformin treatment reduced marrow 
adiposity in T2DM.
