We determined that consuming chungkookjang fermented by Bacillus subtilis (BS) 
or Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BA) alleviated hyperglycemia in partially 
pancreatectomized (Px) rats, an Asian type 2 diabetic (T2D) animal model. Px 
rats had deteriorated glucose metabolism with decreased glucose-stimulated 
insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Insulin secretion capacity was 
improved in the ascending order of the Px-control, positive control (3 mg of 
metformin/kg of body weight), BS (4.5% BS diet), BA (4.5% BA diet), and 
normal-control (sham-operated rats). BA and BS increased β-cell mass and 
decreased malondialdehyde contents and tumor necrosis factor α expression in the 
islets. BA increased hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α 
and PPAR-β similar to the positive control. Bacillales, Lactobacillales, and 
Verrucomicrobiales (Akkermensia muciniphila) increased and Enterobacteriales 
decreased in the BA and BS compared to the Px-control. BA prevented the decrease 
in the villi area and the number of goblet cells in intestinal tissues. In 
conclusion, BA improved glucose regulation by potentiating insulin secretion and 
reducing insulin resistance while maintaining gut mucin contents by improving 
gut microbiota in lean T2D rats.
