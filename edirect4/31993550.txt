OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
inhibitor (SGLT2-I) dapagliflozin on endothelial function in patients with 
high-risk type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
clinical trial of patients with T2DM with underlying ischemic heart disease who 
were receiving metformin and insulin therapy (n = 81). After 12-weeks of 
additional therapy with either dapagliflozin (n = 40) or placebo (n = 41), 
systemic endothelial function was evaluated by change in flow-mediated dilation 
(ΔFMD), change in nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (ΔNMD) and surrogate markers 
including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), endothelial nitric oxide 
synthase (eNOS), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and 
lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]). Glycemic and lipid profiles were also measured.
RESULTS: The dapagliflozin group demonstrated significant reductions of 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) compared to the placebo 
group (ΔHbA1c -0.83 ± 1.47% vs -0.16 ± 1.25%, P = 0.042 and ΔFBG vs -0.73 ± 4.55 
mmol/L vs -1.90 ± 4.40 mmol/L, P = 0.015, respectively). The placebo group 
showed worsening of ΔFMD while the dapagliflozin group maintained similar 
measurements pre- and posttherapy (P = not significant). There was a reduction 
in ICAM-1 levels in the dapagliflozin group (-83.9 ± 205.9 ng/mL, P < 0.02), 
which remained unchanged in the placebo group (-11.0 ± 169.1 ng/mL, P = 0.699). 
Univariate correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation 
between HbA1c and ΔFMD within the active group.
CONCLUSION: A 12-week therapy with dapagliflozin, in addition to insulin and 
metformin therapies, in high-risk patients resulted in significant reductions in 
HbA1c, FBG, and surrogate markers of the endothelial function. Although the 
dapagliflozin group demonstrated a significant association between reduction in 
HbA1c and improvement in FMD, there was no significant difference in FMD between 
the 2 groups.
