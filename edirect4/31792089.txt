BACKGROUND: Individuals may still develop gastric cancer even after Helicobacter 
pylori eradication. We aimed to investigate statin effect on gastric cancer 
development in H. pylori-eradicated subjects.
METHODS: All adult subjects who were prescribed clarithromycin-based triple 
therapy between 2003 and 2012 were identified in this retrospective cohort study 
utilizing a territory-wide electronic healthcare database. Patients were 
observed from index date of H. pylori therapy, and censored at gastric cancer 
diagnosis, death, or December 2015 (study end date). Statin use was defined as 
≥180-day use after index date. Exclusion criteria included gastric cancer 
diagnosed within the first year after index date, previous gastric cancer or 
gastrectomy, and H. pylori treatment failure. Subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 
of gastric cancer with statins was calculated by competing risk regression with 
propensity score (PS) analysis matching 19 variables (age, sex, comorbidities, 
and other drug usage, including proton pump inhibitors, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and metformin).
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.6 years (interquartile range = 
5.1-10.3), 169 (0.27%) of 63,605 patients developed gastric cancer at an 
incidence rate of 3.5 per 10,000 person-years. Among 22,870 PS-matched subjects, 
statins were associated with a lower gastric cancer risk (SHR = 0.34; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.19-0.61), in a duration- and dose-response manner (P 
trend < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Statins were associated with a lower gastric cancer risk in a 
duration- and dose-response manner among H. pylori-eradicated patients.
IMPACT: This study provides evidence on the additional benefits of statins as 
chemopreventive agents against gastric cancer among H. pylori-eradicated 
patients.
