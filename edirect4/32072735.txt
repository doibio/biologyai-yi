AIM: To assess the effects of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin plus metformin 
versus glimepiride plus metformin on liver fat (proton density fat fraction) and 
visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes over 52 weeks of treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a magnetic resonance imaging substudy of a 
52-week, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial that 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin 10 mg/day plus saxagliptin 
5 mg/day versus titrated glimepiride 1-6 mg (1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 mg) in 82 patients 
with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%-10.5%) on metformin ≥1500 mg/day background. 
Analyses were exploratory and not controlled for multiplicity; P-values are 
nominal.
RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 59 patients; liver fat and 
adipose tissue volumes were analysed for 59 and 57 patients, respectively. There 
was a significant >30% reduction from baseline in liver fat (P = 0.007) and >10% 
reduction in adipose tissue volumes (P < 0.01) with dapagliflozin plus 
saxagliptin plus metformin at week 52 versus glimepiride plus metformin. In the 
full-study population, dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin plus metformin decreased 
body weight and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase 
levels over 52 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin significantly decreased liver fat 
and adipose tissue volume versus glimepiride, and reduced serum liver enzyme 
levels, indicating a favourable metabolic profile of dapagliflozin plus 
saxagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin therapy.
