PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A strong association between diabetes mellitus and 
carcinogenesis has been reported in different organs. The purpose of this review 
is to summarize the new evidences in relation to diabetes mellitus and its 
association with the development, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies of head 
and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent publications suggest that glycemic metabolism is altered 
in HNSCC. Elevated blood glucose levels, before or around the time of diagnosis, 
have been reported to reduce survival rates in HNSCC. Also, the homeostasis 
model assessment-insulin resistance has been independently associated with 
disease-free survival, suggesting that improving the glycemic control may 
improve the prognosis in this group of patients.Epidemiological studies revealed 
that cancer patients with diabetes mellitus have less cancer-related mortality 
after antiglycemic treatment, opening the option to include antiglycolytic 
agents, such as metformin, in the therapeutic plan. This finding is in 
accordance with in-vitro studies that demonstrated a decrease in tumor-cell 
proliferation with antidiabetic medications.
SUMMARY: Recent findings highlight the importance of glucose metabolism in the 
pathogenesis and progression of cancer cells. The knowledge of these altered 
pathways gives us an opportunity to design target treatments aimed to modulate 
glucose catabolism.
