BACKGROUND: As a compound Chinese medicine, Zhenqing Recipe (ZQR) has been shown 
to ameliorate hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver and insulin resistance 
in patients with diabetes and diabetic rats. In this paper, we further examined 
the effect of ZQR on diabetes complicated by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) and the underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: Diabetic rats with NAFLD were developed by a high-fat diet (HFD) with 
low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) injection for 4â€‰weeks. These rats were randomly 
separated into the diabetic model (DM), ZQR, metformin (Met), adenovirus 
expressing-salt-induced kinase 1 (Ad-SIK1) and adenovirus labeled with green 
fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) groups. The effects on hepatic expression of 
gluconeogenic genes, glycolipid metabolism and pathological changes were 
subsequently detected.
RESULTS: Serum glucose, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and hepatic 
TG were reduced in the ZQR group. The histopathological and immunohistochemical 
changes in the liver and pancreas in the ZQR group were significantly 
alleviated. The decrease of SIK1 expression was observed in the liver of 
diabetic rats induced by HFD and STZ. SIK1 overexpression in the liver relieved 
hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and fatty liver. Both the mRNA and protein levels 
of CREB-regulated transcription co-activator 2 (CRTC2), phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in the liver were 
drastically reduced, whereas those of SIK1 were markedly increased in the ZQR 
group compared to levels in the DM group. Compared with the DM group, Ser577 
phosphorylation of SIK1 was obviously reduced in the liver, while T182 
phosphorylation of SIK1 and S171 phosphorylation of CRTC2 were evidently 
increased in the Ad-SIK1, Met and ZQR groups.
CONCLUSIONS: ZQR ameliorates hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid storage in 
diabetic rats induced by HFD and STZ by activating the SIK1/CRTC2 signaling 
pathway. Upregulating hepatic SIK1 by ZQR may represent an efficient strategy 
for treating diabetes with NAFLD.
