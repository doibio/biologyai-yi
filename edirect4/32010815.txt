A series of substituted sulfonanilide analogs were prepared and evaluated as 
novel potent inhibitors of SH2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate 
5'-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2). SHIP2 has been shown to be a new attractive target for 
the treatment of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), which can 
lead to life-threatening diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Amongst the synthesized 
compounds, the two most promising candidates, 10 and 11, inhibited SHIP2 
significantly. Additionally, these compounds induced Akt activation in a 
dose-dependent manner, increased the presence of glucose transporter 4 at the 
plasma membrane, and enhanced glucose uptake in cultured myotubes in vitro at 
lower concentrations than metformin, the most widely used antidiabetic drug. 
These results show that the novel SHIP2 inhibitors have insulin sensitizing 
capacity and provide prototypes for further drug development for T2D and DKD.
