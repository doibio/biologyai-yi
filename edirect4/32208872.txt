Objective: The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to examine whether 
adherence to metformin treatment may be associated with lower onset of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Method: Using the computerized databases of a 
2.3-million state-mandated health services organization in Israel, we identified 
incident RA cases among a cohort of 113 749 adult patients who initiated 
metformin therapy between 1998 and 2014. Adherence was assessed by calculating 
the mean proportion of follow-up days covered (PDC) with metformin.Results: 
During the 18 year study period, there were 558 incident RA cases (61 per 
100 000 person-years). Adherence to metformin treatment was associated with a 
lower risk of developing RA, with the lowest risk recorded among patients with a 
PDC of 40-59% [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.45-0.84] compared with non-adherent patients (PDC < 20%). A mean daily 
metformin dose of 2550 mg or more was also associated with a lower risk of 
developing RA (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46-0.84) compared to a daily dose of 
850 mg or less. In stratified analyses by gender, the negative association 
between adherence and the risk of RA was limited to women alone.Conclusions: 
Adherence to metformin treatment is associated with a reduced risk of developing 
RA in women. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of metformin on RA 
development in other patient populations.
