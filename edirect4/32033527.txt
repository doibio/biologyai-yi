BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (VD) may increase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and subsequently 
PPAR-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) and irisin levels and these improvements may 
reduce insulin resistance (IR). The aim was to assess the effects of vitamin D 
supplementation on SIRT1, irisin, and IR in overweight/obese type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) patients.
METHODS: Ninety T2D males and females were recruited as a clinical trial study 
(mean of age and body mass index (BMI) of intervention and placebo groups were 
50.05 ± 10.17 and 50.36 ± 10.2 yrs. and 31.37 ± 3.4 and 30.43 ± 3.2 kg/m2, 
respectively). The inclusion criteria were T2D, VD deficient, BMI > 25 kg/m2, 
and serum HbA1c < 8.5%. The exclusion criteria were using vitamin and mineral 
supplements, having any acute disease, recent modifying dose or type of drugs. 
The supplementation was 50,000 IU/week VD or placebo for 8 weeks. The 
demographic characteristics, anthropometrics, dietary intakes and physical 
activity status, sun exposure status, fasting blood sugar (FBS) and insulin, 
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), irisin, SIRT1, 25-hydroxy D3 (25(OH)VD), 
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and quantitative 
insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were determined. The significant 
P-value was ≤0.05.
RESULTS: The increase of serum VD, SIRT1, and irisin in the intervention group 
was significant (p < 0.001). HbA1c was decreased significantly by 1%. The 
changes in the other glucose indices (FBS, insulin, and IR) were 
non-significant.
CONCLUSIONS: VD supplementation may improve T2D by decreasing HbA1c and 
increasing SIRT1 and irisin in VD deficient T2D patients. Further trials are 
suggested.
