BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Imeglimin (IMEG) is the first in a novel class of 
oral glucose-lowering agents with a unique mechanism of action targeting 
mitochondrial bioenergetics. We assessed whether repeated co-administration of 
IMEG and either metformin (MET) or sitagliptin (SITA) would influence the 
pharmacokinetics of either MET or SITA in healthy Caucasian men.
METHODS: Healthy Caucasian men received either MET 850 mg twice daily with 
placebo (n = 16) or SITA 100 mg once daily with placebo (n = 16) on days 1-6, 
followed by MET 850 mg twice daily with IMEG 1500 mg twice daily or SITA 100 mg 
once daily with IMEG 1500 mg twice daily on days 7-12. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters were determined from blood and urine; levels of all compounds were 
evaluated using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Systemic exposure (AUC0-τ area under the plasma concentration-time 
curve over a dosing interval and maximum concentration) to MET was 14% and 10% 
lower, respectively, when administered with IMEG. Approximately 40% of MET was 
excreted unchanged in urine, decreasing to 34% when given with IMEG. The 90% 
confidence intervals for AUC0-τ and maximum concentration indicated no effect of 
co-administration on systemic exposure to MET. Mean AUC0-τ and maximum 
concentration of SITA were similar with or without IMEG. Median times to maximum 
concentration were 0.7 and 1.0 h and mean elimination half-lives were 8.2 and 
8.7 h with and without IMEG, respectively. Systemic exposure to IMEG was similar 
to previous phase I studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of IMEG with MET or SITA did not result in 
clinically relevant changes in systemic exposure to MET or SITA, although minor 
reductions in exposure (AUC0-τ and maximum concentration) and renal elimination 
were noted when MET was given with IMEG vs placebo.
