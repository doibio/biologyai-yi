The serine/threonine kinase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a drug target 
for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Metformin, a widely 
prescribed anti-hyperglycemic agent, and β-guanidinopropionic acid (β-GPA), a 
dietary supplement and creatine analog, have been shown to increase activity of 
AMPK. Macroautophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway for aggregated 
proteins and dysfunctional organelles, which can be mediated by AMPK. The 
present study sought to elucidate how metformin and β-GPA affect cell 
morphology, AMPK activity, autophagy and mitochondrial morphology and function 
in developing C2C12 myotubes. β-GPA reduced myotube diameter and increased 
length throughout differentiation, while metformin increased myotube diameter 
only at the 48 h time point. β-GPA treatment enhanced AMPK signaling and 
expression of autophagy-related proteins. β-GPA treatment also increased the 
density of autophagosomes, autolysosomes, and lysosomes. Metformin also 
increased activation of AMPK after 48 h, but in contrast to β-GPA, led to a 
dramatic reduction in the density of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Both 
metformin and β-GPA reduced the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, and 
differentially altered mitochondrial morphology. Obesity and T2D have been shown 
to increase mitochondrial dysfunction and reduce autophagic flux in skeletal 
muscle cells. Therefore, β-GPA may help to alleviate the effects of metabolic 
disease by increasing autophagic flux in skeletal muscle cells. In contrast, the 
reduction of autophagy by metformin may lead to dysregulation of mitochondrial 
maintenance, as well as muscle development.
