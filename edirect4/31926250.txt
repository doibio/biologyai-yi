AIMS: Chemo-resistance still was the main obstacle for AML patients, more 
effective and less toxic forms of therapies were desperately needed. Metformin, 
a classic hypoglycemic drug for diabetes recently delivered us a new identity 
that it exerted anti-tumor activity through suppressing mTOR in various tumors. 
But the anti-tumor effect of metformin in AML was not clear.
METHODS: In this study, we used CCK8 assay and apoptosis assay to determine the 
anti-leukemia activity of metformin combined with AraC, and explore the 
mechanism of the joint role of Ara-C/metformin in AML. We finally used xenograft 
experiment in mice to determine the anti-leukemia effect of Ara-C/metformin in 
vivo.
KEY FINDINGS: We found that metformin could synergistically sensitize AML cells 
to Ara-C via inhibiting mTORC1/P70S6K pathway. In vivo experiment also verified 
metformin in aid of Ara-C caused an obviously synergistic anti-tumor effect.
SIGNIFICANCE: We firstly found the synergistic anti-tumor effect of 
Ara-C/metformin in AML through inhibiting mTORC1/P70S6K pathway.
