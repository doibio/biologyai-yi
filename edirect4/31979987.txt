This study investigated the influence of dietary phenolic acid- Gallic acid (GA) 
on the antihyperglycemic properties of acarbose (ACA) and metformin (MET). 
Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated (p.o) with ACA, MET, GA and 
their combinations for 14 days. The effects of the treatments on blood glucose 
and insulin levels, pancreas α-amylase and intestinal α-glucosidase activities, 
as well as thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), thiol and reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) levels, including antioxidant enzyme activities were 
investigated. A significant increase in blood glucose, insulin, ROS and TBARS 
levels, and impaired antioxidant status, as well as elevation in the activities 
of α-amylase and α-glucosidase observed in diabetic rats were ameliorated in the 
treatment groups. Hpwever, GA had varying effects on the antidiabetic properties 
of the drugs. Nevertheless, GA showed more potentiating effects on the 
antidiabetic effect of MET and these effects were better observed at the lower 
dose of GA.
