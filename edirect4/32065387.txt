OBJECTIVES: Many older adults with limited life expectancy and/or advanced 
dementia (LLE/AD) are potentially overtreated for diabetes and may benefit from 
deintensification. Our aim was to examine the incidence and predictors of 
diabetes medication deintensification in older Veterans with LLE/AD who were 
potentially overtreated at admission to Veterans Affairs (VA) nursing homes 
(community living centers [CLCs]).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using linked VA and Medicare 
clinical/administrative data and Minimum Data Set assessments.
SETTING: VA CLCs.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6960 Veterans with diabetes and LLE/AD admitted to VA 
CLCs in fiscal years 2009 to 2015 with hemoglobin (Hb)A1c measured within 
90 days of admission.
MEASUREMENTS: We evaluated treatment deintensification (discontinuation or dose 
reduction for a consecutive 7-day period) among residents who were potentially 
overtreated (HbA1c ≤7.5% and receiving hypoglycemic medications). Competing risk 
models assessed 90-day cumulative incidence of deintensification.
RESULTS: More than 40% (n = 3056) of Veteran CLC residents with diabetes were 
potentially overtreated. The cumulative incidence of deintensification at 
90 days was 45.5%. Higher baseline HbA1c values were associated with a lower 
likelihood of deintensification (e.g., HbA1c 7.0-7.5% vs <6.0%; adjusted risk 
ratio [aRR] = .57; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .50-.66). Compared with 
non-sulfonylurea oral agents (e.g., metformin), other treatment regimens were 
more likely to be deintensified (aRR = 1.31-1.88), except for basal insulin (aRR 
= .59; 95% CI = .52-.66). The only resident factor associated with increased 
likelihood of deintensification was documented end-of-life status (aRR = 1.12; 
95% CI = 1.01-1.25). Admission from home/assisted living (aRR = .85; 95% CI = 
.75-.96), obesity (aRR = .88; 95% CI = .78-.99), and peripheral vascular disease 
(aRR = .90; 95% CI = .81-.99) were associated with decreased likelihood of 
deintensification.
CONCLUSION: Deintensification of treatment regimens occurred in less than 
one-half of potentially overtreated Veterans and was more strongly associated 
with low HbA1c values and use of medications with high risk for hypoglycemia, 
rather than other resident characteristics. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:736-745, 2020.
