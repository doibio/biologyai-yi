AIMS: To investigate the effect of hypoglycaemia on platelet and coagulation 
activation in people with type 2 diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This monocentric, open, single-arm, mechanistic trial 
included 14 people with established type 2 diabetes (four women, 10 men, age 
55 ± 7 years, glycated haemoglobin concentration 51 ± 7 mmol/mol) receiving 
metformin monotherapy. A stepwise hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp 
experiment (3.5 and 2.5 mmol/L, for 30 minutes respectively) was performed, 
aiming to investigate platelet and coagulation activity during predefined 
plateaus of hypoglycaemia, as well as 1 day and 7 days later.
RESULTS: While platelet activation assessed by light transmittance aggregometry 
did not significantly increase after the hypoglycaemic clamp procedure, the more 
sensitive flow cytometry-based measurement of platelet surface activation 
markers showed hypoglycaemia-induced activation 24 hours (PAC1pos CD62Ppos , 
PAC1pos CD63Ppos and PAC1pos CD62Ppos CD63pos ; P < .01) and 7 days after the 
hypoglycaemic clamp (P < .001 for PAC1pos CD63pos ; P < .01 for PAC1pos CD62Ppos 
and PAC1pos CD62Ppos CD63pos ) in comparison to baseline. Coagulation markers, 
such as fibrinogen, D-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, von Willebrand 
factor activity and factor VIII, were also significantly increased, an effect 
that was most pronounced 24 hours after the hypoglycaemic clamp.
CONCLUSION: A single event of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia led to an increase 
in markers of platelet activation and coagulation in people with early stages of 
type 2 diabetes on metformin therapy. However, the activation occurred with a 
delay and was evident 24 hours and 7 days after the actual hypoglycaemic 
episode.
