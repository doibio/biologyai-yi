BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effect of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus on survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed NSCLC patients who had undergone radical 
lung cancer surgery from January 2011 to December 2014 in the Anhui Medical 
University affiliated Anhui Provincial Hospital. Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank 
tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to describe the 
effect of type 2 diabetes mellitus on the overall survival of patients with 
NSCLC.
RESULTS: A total of 769 patients with NSCLC were enrolled, including 126 in the 
diabetic mellitus group and 643 in the nondiabetic mellitus group. The one, 
three, and five-year survival for patients with and without diabetes mellitus 
were 86.1% versus 89.6%, 49.5% versus 62.4%, and 33.3% versus 40.6%, 
respectively. The Cox model showed that type 2 diabetes mellitus was a poor 
independent prognostic factors for NSCLC patients. In addition, metformin is a 
good independent prognostic factor for patients with non-small cell lung cancer 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSIONS: NSCLC patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased 
survival rate compared with those with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
