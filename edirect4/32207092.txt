BACKGROUND: Metformin, a widely prescribed antidiabetic drug, has been suggested 
to have a neuroprotective effect on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine 
(MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity in mice. In this study, we investigated the 
neuroprotective potential of metformin against rotenone-induced dopaminergic 
neuron damage and its underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were given saline or rotenone (2.5 mg/kg/day, ip) 
injection for 10 days. Metformin treatment (300 mg/kg/day, ip) was started 
concurrently with rotenone administration and continued for 10 days. The 
neuroprotective effect of metformin on rotenone-induced dopaminergic toxicity 
was assessed by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), cleaved caspase-3 and α-synuclein 
immunohistochemistry in substantia nigra (SN). SN tissues were extracted for 
biochemical analysis. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein 
levels were measured by spectrophotometric assay.
RESULTS: We found that metformin treatment attenuated the rotenone-induced loss 
of TH+ neurons in the SN. Additionally, metformin significantly decreased the 
rotenone-induced increase of cleaved caspase-3 and α-synuclein accumulation in 
the SN; however, there was no difference in motor behaviours between the 
experimental groups. Meanwhile, the levels of MDA and 4-HNE in SN were 
significantly reduced in the rotenone-metformin group compared to the rotenone 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that metformin treatment attenuated dopaminergic 
neuron loss in SN induced by rotenone by decreasing lipid peroxidation.
