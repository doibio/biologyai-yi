INTRODUCTION: The goal of this retrospective study was to investigate the 
potential link between diabetes mellitus (DM) and the recurrence of pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET) following curative intent surgery.
METHODS: We included patients who underwent surgical resection of nonmetastatic 
well-differentiated PanNET. Exacerbation of DM was defined as the postoperative 
occurrence of DM or worsening of preexisting DM. We explored the variables 
associated with PanNET recurrence-free survival (RFS). RFS was compared in a 
subset of patients with and without DM operated on by anatomical resection, 
after matching for the main prognostic factors. The impact of antidiabetic 
therapy on RFS was assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 268 patients (median age 54.7, 40% men) were included. Most 
PanNET were sporadic (85%), G1 (61%), pT1/pT2 (79%), and pN0 (76%). 
Postoperative DM exacerbation occurred in 38 patients (14%), including 27 with 
new-onset DM. On multivariable analysis, DM exacerbation was independently 
associated with an increased risk of PanNET recurrence (HR 2.35, 95% CI 
[1.24-4.47], p = 0.009) after adjustment for age, multiplicity of tumors, grade, 
pT, and pN stages. Similar results were found when 27 patients with and 48 
patients without DM exacerbation, matched for grade, pT stage and pN stage, were 
compared (HR 3.03, 95% CI [1.05-8.77], p = 0.032). The postoperative use of 
metformin tended to decrease the risk of recurrence (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.24-1.47, 
p = 0.26).
CONCLUSION: Patients with postoperative DM exacerbation may have an increased 
risk of PanNET recurrence. Closer follow-up might be beneficial in these 
patients. The protective role of metformin should be further explored.
