INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence suggests that metformin has a potential 
antitumor effect both in vitro and in vivo. Increasing epidemiological studies 
indicate that diabetic patients receiving metformin therapy have lower 
incidences of cancer and have better survival rates. However, there are limited 
and inconsistent studies available about the effect of metformin therapy on 
ovarian cancer (OC). Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to study the effect 
of metformin therapy on OC. Meanwhile, we systematically reviewed relevant 
studies to provide a framework for future research.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We conducted a systematic literature search on PubMed, Web 
of Science, Springerlink, CNKI, VIP, SinoMed, and Wanfang up to the period of 
October 2018. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to derive pooled 
effect estimates.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 13 studies were retrieved of which 5 studies 
explained the prevention and 8 studies explained the treatment for OC. Our 
pooled results showed that metformin has a potential preventive effect on OC in 
diabetic women (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 
0.34, 1.11; P<0.001). In addition, metformin can also significantly prolong 
progression-free survival (PFS) (pooled hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.34, 
0.70; P=0.002), and overall survival (OS) (HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.61, 0.82; P<0.001) 
in patients with OC, regardless of whether they had diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of metformin can potentially reduce the risk of OC among 
diabetics, and it also can significantly improve PFS and OS in patients with OC. 
A further large clinical investigation would be needed to adopt our finding in 
practice, however, our systematic review provides an insight for future study 
designs.
