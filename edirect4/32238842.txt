While basal insulin remains the most effective antidiabetic agent and 
substantially reduces the risk of hypoglycemia, few studies have examined the 
comparative effect of basal insulin in the real-world setting. This study aimed 
to assess the outcomes of adding basal insulin compared with thiazolidinediones 
(TZDs) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) as a third antidiabetic 
agent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A retrospective cohort 
study involving T2DM was conducted with health administrative data in Taiwan. 
Patients starting a third antidiabetic agent after receiving a 
metformin-containing dual combination were identified. The study endpoints 
included composite major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), all-cause 
mortality, and hypoglycemia. Propensity score matching and Cox modeling were 
used for analysis. After matching, the basal insulin and TZD groups contained 
6,101 and 11,823 patients, respectively, and the basal insulin and DPP-4i groups 
contained 6,051 and 11,900 patients, respectively. TZDs and DPP-4is were both 
associated with similar risks of MACEs and hypoglycemia but a lower risk of 
all-cause mortality than basal insulin (TZDs: HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.81; 
DPP-4is: HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.82). Further studies are needed to elucidate the 
findings of increased all-cause mortality risk in patients receiving basal 
insulin, especially those with advanced diabetes.
