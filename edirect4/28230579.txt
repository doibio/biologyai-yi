OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of hospital 
visits associated with medication-related problems (MRPs, i.e., adverse drug 
events [ADEs], adverse drug reactions [ADRs], nonadherence [NA] to medication, 
and medication error) and to identify the medications involved in hospital 
visits associated with MRPs in outpatient departments (OPDs).
METHODS: A prospective observational study was carried out in OPD of 11 
hospitals in the lower northern region of Thailand. Patients visiting OPDs were 
screened for suspected MRPs by clinical pharmacists using medical record review 
supplemented by patient interview. Three experts evaluated suspected MRPs using 
the following 3 criteria: causality, severity, and preventability.
RESULTS: Of the 3069 patients who visited the OPDs during the study period, 113 
(3.7%) were deemed to have causal MRPs. Nearly half of the causal MRPs (n = 49, 
43.4%) were preventable. The following 4 types of causal MRPs were identified: 
ADEs (n = 112, 3.7%), ADRs (n = 65, 2.1%), NA to medications (n = 48, 1.6%), and 
medication errors (n = 1, 0.03%). In nonelective patients (n = 764), 35 patients 
(4.6%) were judged to have causal MRPs. Of the nonelective patients who 
experienced causal MRPs, 25 (71.4%) were preventable. The medications commonly 
associated with ADEs and NA to medication were those targeting the 
cardiovascular system (especially enalapril, amlodipine, and 
hydrochlorothiazide), whereas the medications involving ADRs involved the 
cardiovascular and endocrine systems (especially, enalapril, amlodipine, and 
metformin).
CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient department visits associated with MRPs, particularly in 
nonelective patients, were preventable. Effective strategies are needed for 
reducing visits to hospital OPD associated with preventable MRPs.
