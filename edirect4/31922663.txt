Antipsychotics are used for many psychiatric conditions in youth. Although 
developmentally inappropriate weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, which are 
risk factors for premature cardiovascular mortality, are especially frequent in 
youth, optimal strategies to reduce pediatric antipsychotic-induced 
overweight/obesity are unclear. The Improving Metabolic Parameters in 
Antipsychotic Child Treatment (IMPACT) was a randomized, parallel group, 24-week 
clinical trial which enrolled overweight/obese, psychiatrically stable youth, 
aged 8-19 years, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of severe mental illness (schizophrenia 
spectrum disorder, bipolar spectrum disorder or psychotic depression), at four 
US universities. All of them had developed substantial weight gain following 
treatment with a second-generation antipsychotic. The centralized, 
computer-based randomization system assigned participants to unmasked treatment 
groups: metformin (MET); antipsychotic switch (aripiprazole or, if already 
exposed to that drug, perphenazine or molindone; SWITCH); or continued baseline 
antipsychotic (CONTROL). All participants received healthy lifestyle education. 
The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI) z-score change from baseline, 
analyzed using estimated least squares means. Altogether, 127 participants were 
randomized: 49 to MET, 31 to SWITCH, and 47 to CONTROL. BMI z-score decreased 
significantly with MET (week 24: -0.09±0.03, p=0.002) and SWITCH (week 24: 
-0.11±0.04, p=0.003), while it increased non-significantly with CONTROL (week 
24: +0.04±0.03). On 3-way comparison, BMI z-score changes differed significantly 
(p=0.001). MET and SWITCH were each superior to CONTROL (p=0.002), with effect 
sizes of 0.68 and 0.81 respectively, while MET and SWITCH did not differ. More 
gastrointestinal problems occurred in MET than in SWITCH or CONTROL. The data 
safety monitoring board closed the perphenazine-SWITCH arm because 35.2% of 
subjects discontinued treatment due to psychiatric worsening. These data suggest 
that pediatric antipsychotic-related overweight/obesity can be reduced by adding 
metformin or switching to a lower risk antipsychotic. Healthy lifestyle 
education is not sufficient to prevent ongoing BMI z-score increase.
