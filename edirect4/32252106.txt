Disordered intestinal sweet taste receptors (STRs) are implicated in glucose 
homeostasis by involving in incretin secretion and glucose absorption. However, 
the effects of antidiabetic medications on STRs, downstream molecules, and 
glucose transporters expression are unknown. In our study, ZDF rats (n=24) were 
randomly treated by metformin (MET, 215.15 mg/kg), sitagliptin (SIT, 
10.76 mg/kg), or saline for 4 weeks. Fasting blood glucose and insulin levels 
were measured, and HOMA-IR and QUICKI index were calculated. One week later, we 
detected relative mRNA expression of T1R2/T1R3, α-gustducin, TRPM5 and glucose 
transporters including SGLT1, SGLT2, and GLUT2 in the small intestine and 
kidney. We found that though both metformin and sitagliptin effectively 
decreased fasting blood glucose, only metformin improved HOMA-IR and QUICKI 
(p<0.05). MRNA levels of STRs and sweet taste molecules in duodenum and jejunum 
were not different among three groups, but those in ileum were dramatically 
upregulated after SIT (vs. MET p<0.05; vs. CON p<0.01). SGLT1 and GLUT2 in ileum 
were markedly increased after SIT (p<0.01). In the kidney, expression of SGLT2 
and GLUT2 were downregulated in both SIT and MET group (p<0.05). In conclusion, 
metformin and sitagliptin exerted different effects on expression of STRs and 
glucose transporters in the gut and kidney. STRs, downstream molecules, and 
glucose transporters in distal small intestinal were sensitively increased in 
response to sitagliptin than metformin treatment. Renal glucose transporters 
were downregulated after metformin and sitagliptin treatment.
