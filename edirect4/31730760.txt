Increasing costs, much time consumption and high risk of failure associated with 
the process of de novo development of new anticancer drugs have prompted the 
pharmaceutical industry to seek alternative strategies that may facilitate and 
accelerate the whole process. In particular, the repurposing strategy, known 
also as repositioning or reprofiling strategy, is a potential source of new 
treatment options for cancer patients with high unmet medical needs. However, it 
should be noted that the repurposing strategy, being still a new trend in drug 
development, should only complement the process of discovering new anticancer 
drugs, and should not be its alternative. The best repurposable oncological drug 
candidates are the agents whose original patent protection has already expired, 
and for which there is a possibility to create a formulation enabling, together 
with a new therapeutic indication, new patent protection. In this review article 
we discuss the advantages of the repurposing strategy, and provide an overview 
of a number of promising candidates, such as artesunate, aspirin, cimetidine, 
doxycycline, ivermectin, metformin, rapamycin (sirolimus), and thalidomide, that 
have the potential to be repurposed as anticancer drugs both in cancer 
prevention and therapy. In addition, we highlight some of the studies regarding 
the signalling pathways and molecular targets altered by these drugs, and 
describe the biological mechanisms underlying their anticancer effects.
