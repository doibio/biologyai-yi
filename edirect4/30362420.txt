BACKGROUND: Nowadays, there is an accumulated data about the relation between 
hypomagnesemia (low Serum Mg level < 0.7 mmol/l) and diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of hypomagnesemia 
in a carefully diagnosed diabetes patients and to show how some factors could 
contribute to the prevalence of low serum Mg level among the population under 
study.
METHODS: In short, 62 patients of both type 1 and 2, who attended AL-Sadir 
medical city/ diabetes and endocrinology centre during the period of the study 
were included in the study. A detailed history was taken and participants were 
informed verbally about the procedure of this study. Serum magnesium and 
creatinine were measured using standardized methods.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of the hypomagnesemia, among diabetic population 
involved in this study, was 29.03 % and it was nearly similar in male (29.41 %) 
and female (28.57 %). The means(SD) of serum Mg level were similar in type 1 and 
type 2 diabetic patients. Other difference in prevalence among other 
characteristics has been reported. Within all participants, gender (r = -0.02), 
fasting blood glucose (r = -0.514) and metformin use (r = -0.014) were 
negatively correlated with serum Mg level, in contrast to other variables, which 
were positively correlated. While among type 1 DM, age (r= 0.193), serum 
creatinine (r= 0.031) and insulin use (r= 0.217) were positively correlated with 
serum Mg level. In contrast, others were negatively correlated. In type 2 DM, 
age (r = -0.283) and fasting blood glucose (r = -0.496) were negatively 
correlated with serum Mg level. On the other hand, other variables were 
positively correlated with serum Mg level.
CONCLUSION: Hypomagnesemia prevalence was detected in nearly one-third of the 
diabetic population, which is quite high prevalence. Some factors have shown to 
play an essential role in this prevalence. A large study is warranted to address 
this issue.
