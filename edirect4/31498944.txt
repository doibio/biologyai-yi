RATIONALE: Understanding drug-drug interactions and predicting the side effects 
induced by polypharmacy are difficult because there are few suitable platforms 
that can predict drug-drug interactions and possible side effects. Hence, 
developing a platform to identify significant protein markers of drug-drug 
interactions and their associated side effects is necessary to avoid adverse 
effects.
METHODS: Human liver cells were treated with ethosuximide in combination with 
cimetidine, ketotifen, metformin, metronidazole, or phenytoin. After sample 
preparation and extraction, mitochondrial proteins from liver cells were 
isolated and digested with trypsin. Then, peptide solutions were detected using 
a nano ultra-performance liquid chromatographic system combined with tandem mass 
spectrometry. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool was used to simulate drug-drug 
interactions and identify protein markers associated with drug-induced adverse 
effects.
RESULTS: Several protein markers were identified by the proposed method after 
liver cells were co-treated with ethosuximide and other drugs. Several of these 
protein markers have previously been reported in the literature, indicating that 
the proposed platform is workable.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the proposed in vitro platform, significant protein markers 
of drug-drug interactions could be identified by mass spectrometry. This 
workflow can then help predict indicators of drug-drug interactions and 
associated adverse effects for increased safety in clinical prescriptions.
