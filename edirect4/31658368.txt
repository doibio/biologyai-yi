An association between maternal diabetes, its medication and childhood cancer 
has not been previously explored in a registry-based setting. With a 
case-control design, we aimed to explore whether maternal diabetes is associated 
with an increased risk of childhood cancer in the offspring. Combining data from 
population-based registries, we analyzed a total of 2,029 cases, that is, 
persons with childhood cancer diagnosed under the age of 20 years between years 
1996-2014 and a total of 10,103 matched population controls. The mothers of the 
cases/controls and their diagnoses of diabetes (DM) before/during pregnancy as 
well as their insulin/metformin prescriptions during pregnancy were identified. 
Conditional logistic regression modeling was used to analyze the risk of 
childhood cancer. The OR for childhood cancer among those exposed to any 
maternal diabetes was 1.32 (95% CI 1.14-1.54) compared to the offspring of the 
nondiabetic mothers. The effect of maternal diabetes on the risk of childhood 
cancer remained elevated even after adjusting for maternal age, parity and 
smoking. Our data suggest that maternal diabetes medication may reduce the risk 
for childhood cancer (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.36-1.94), especially in 
gestational diabetes (adjusted OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05-1.25), compared to the 
diabetic mothers without medication. The risk of childhood leukemia was 
significantly higher among children exposed to any maternal diabetes (OR 1.36, 
CI 1.04-1.77) compared to the unexposed. Maternal diabetes appears to be 
associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer in the offspring. The 
possible risk-reducing effect of an exposure to diabetes medication on offspring 
cancer risk warrants further investigation.
