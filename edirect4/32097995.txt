The safety of metformin use for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
and advanced kidney disease is controversial, and more recent guidelines have 
suggested that metformin be used cautiously in this group until more definitive 
evidence concerning its safety is available. The Korean Diabetes Association and 
the Korean Society of Nephrology have agreed on consensus statements concerning 
metformin use for patients with T2DM and renal dysfunction, particularly when 
these patients undergo imaging studies using iodinated contrast media (ICM). 
Metformin can be used safely when the estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) is ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m². If the eGFR is between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m², 
metformin treatment should not be started. If metformin is already in use, a 
daily dose of ≤1,000 mg is recommended. Metformin is contraindicated when the 
eGFR is <30 mL/min/1.73 m². Renal function should be evaluated prior to any 
ICM-related procedures. During procedures involving intravenous administration 
of ICM, metformin should be discontinued starting the day of the procedures and 
up to 48 hours post-procedures if the eGFR is <60 mL/min/1.73 m².
