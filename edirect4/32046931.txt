BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes (GDM) imparts a high risk of developing 
diabetes postpartum. Insulin resistance appears to be the major contributor. 
Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, improves peripheral glucose 
disposal and reduces body weight. We evaluated whether liraglutide in 
combination with metformin (MET-LIRA) is more effective than metformin 
monotherapy (MET-P) in improving insulin action and reducing body weight in 
overweight prior GDM (pGDM) women.
METHODS: Women (n = 153; body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2; 18-45 y; GDM within 
12 months) with metabolic abnormalities were randomized to MET-LIRA 
(MET-2000 mg, LIRA 1.8 mg SC QD) or MET-P (MET-2000 mg, Placebo QD). Study 
visits at baseline, 36-40, 56-60 and 80-84 weeks included body weight (BW), BMI, 
waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio measures. Oral glucose tolerance 
tests (OGTTs) were performed to assess glycemia, mean blood glucose (MBG), 
lipids, and compute insulin sensitivity and secretion measures.
FINDINGS: Seventy-two (47%) participants completed the study. MET-LIRA therapy 
was significantly better in improving MBG and insulin sensitivity indices 
[SIOGTT MET-LIRA from 4.6 (3.2) to 5.9 (2.9) vs. MET-P 5.5 (3.0) to 5.4 (3.2)] 
and reducing BW and central adiposity [BMI MET-LIRA from 37.2 (8.3) to 33.8 
(5.2) vs MET-P 33.8(5.2) to 32.8(6)]. MET-LIRA therapy but not MET-P decreased 
triglycerides (TRG) and TRG/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratios.
INTERPRETATION: MET-LIRA treatment demonstrated superior efficacy in correcting 
the metabolic status of pGDM women over 84 weeks of therapy. The addition of 
liraglutide to metformin therapy resulted in a more dramatic decrease in BW and 
central adiposity than metformin alone.
