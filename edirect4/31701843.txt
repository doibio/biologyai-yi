Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common and important microvascular 
complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). The main clinical features of DN are 
proteinuria and a progressive decline in renal function, which are associated 
with structural and functional changes in the kidney. The pathogenesis of DN is 
multifactorial, including genetic, metabolic, and haemodynamic factors, which 
can trigger a sequence of events. Controlling metabolic risks such as 
hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia is not enough to slow the 
progression of DN. Recent studies emphasized immunoinflammation as a critical 
pathogenic factor in the progression of DN. Therefore, targeting inflammation is 
considered a potential and novel treatment strategy for DN. In this review, we 
will briefly introduce the inflammatory process of DN and discuss the 
anti-inflammatory effects of antidiabetic drugs when treating DN.
