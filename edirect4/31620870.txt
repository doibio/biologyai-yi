Wound healing could be categorized as a chronic disorder which needs a prompt 
and effective medication. Nowadays, vascular problems and wound-healing 
progression studies relay on the role of metformin; however, the exact 
mechanisms for its beneficial effects are still not completely understood. The 
aim of the present work was to study the potential of metformin hydrochloride, 
MET-HCL hydrogel in wound healing after topical administration. MET-HCL hydrogel 
was formulated using different hydrogel bases then characterised for its drug 
content and pH, homogeneity, viscosity, spreadability, and in vitro release. 
Furthermore, the wound-healing activity was evaluated in rats. Clinical study 
was also performed in patients showing lower limbs traumatic wounds and 
cutaneous ulcers. In addition, histopathology and immunohistochemical studies 
were also investigated. Results showed that MET-HCL hydrogels have a high drug 
content, and they are homogenous and spreadable with minimum sheer stress and 
showed null irritation. Furthermore, carbopol showed the optimum gel base for 
the highest MET-HCL release. Wound healing activity in rats showed a significant 
(p < 0.05) increase in the percentage wound contraction from the day-7 compared 
with plain hydrogel. Clinical study revealed a complete healing of traumatic 
wounds and cutaneous ulcers after 21 and 30 days, respectively. Moreover, 
histopathology investigation showed a complete restoration of connective tissue 
matrix and re-epithelization of the induced wound. In addition, 
immunohistochemistry showed a significant expression of transforming growth 
factor-β1 (TGF-β1). In conclusion, MET-HCL hydrogel is a promising formulation 
for topical treatment of wounds with effective and faster healing activity.
