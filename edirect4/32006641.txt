PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vildagliptin or 
vildagliptin/metformin combination among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) uncontrolled on insulin in a real-world setting in Egypt.
METHODS: This 12-week, prospective, observational study enrolled T2DM patients. 
Primary endpoint was mean change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to 
Week 12. Secondary endpoints included mean change in body weight, insulin dosage 
and safety after 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Of the 90 patients enrolled, 88 (93.6%) completed the study. The mean 
age was 54.7 years; men, 51.1%; body mass index (BMI), 31.6 kg/m2; T2DM 
duration, 89.8 months; insulin dose, 55.14 IU/day. At 12 weeks, HbA1c decreased 
significantly with vildagliptin/metformin (-1.3 ± 0.9%, p < 0.0001) and 
vildagliptin (-1.1 ± 0.9%, p = 0.0001). 27.1% and 11.1% achieved HbA1c <7% in 
vildagliptin/metformin and vildagliptin groups, respectively. Significant mean 
(±standard deviation [SD]) reduction in body weight (-2.5 ± 7.3 kg, p = 0.0055) 
and insulin dose (-24.11 ± 22.3 IU, p < 0.0001) was observed in the 
vildagliptin/metformin group. Overall, 8 (8.9%) patients reported 11 (12.2%) 
adverse events (AEs) and no hypoglycemic events. AEs possibly related to the 
study drug (4.2%, in vildagliptin/metformin) were mild in severity.
CONCLUSION: Vildagliptin with/without metformin as an add-on to insulin resulted 
in good glycemic control and was well tolerated without any hypoglycemic events.
