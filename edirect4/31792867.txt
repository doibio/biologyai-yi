BACKGROUND: People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk for adverse 
events and/or CKD progression with use of renally eliminated or nephrotoxic 
medications.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication 
(PIM) use by U.S. adults by CKD stage and self-reported CKD awareness.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Surveys, 2011-2016 PARTICIPANTS: Non-pregnant adults with stages 3a (eGFR 45-59 
mL/min/1.73 m2), 3b (eGFR 30-44), or 4-5 (eGFR < 30) CKD, stratified as 
CKD-aware/unaware.
MAIN MEASURES: PIMs were identified on the basis of KDIGO guidelines, label 
information, and literature review. We calculated proportions using any and 
individual PIMs, assessing for differences over CKD awareness within each CKD 
stage. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, 
comorbidities, and insurance type.
KEY RESULTS: Adjusted proportions of U.S. adults taking any PIM(s) exceeded 50% 
for all CKD stages and awareness categories, and were highest among CKD-unaware 
patients with stages 4-5 CKD: 66.6% (95% CI, 55.5-77.8). Proton pump inhibitors, 
opioids, metformin, sulfonylureas, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) were all used frequently across CKD stages. NSAIDs were used less 
frequently when CKD-aware by patients with stage 3a CKD (2.2% [95% CI, - 0.3 to 
4.7] vs. 10.7% [95% CI, 7.6 to 13.8]) and stages 4-5 CKD (0.8% [95% CI, - 0.9 to 
2.5] vs. 16.5% [95% CI, 4.0 to 29.0]). Metformin was used less frequently when 
CKD-aware by patients with stage 3b CKD (8.1% [95% CI, 0.3-15.9] vs. 26.5% [95% 
CI, 17.4-35.7]) and stages 4-5 CKD (none vs. 20.8% [95% CI, 1.8-39.8]). The 
impact of CKD awareness was statistically significant after correction for 
multiple comparisons only for NSAIDs in stage 3a CKD.
CONCLUSIONS: PIMs are frequently used by people with CKD, with some impact of 
CKD awareness on NSAID and metformin use. This may lead to adverse outcomes or 
hasten CKD progression, reinforcing the need for improved medication management 
among people with CKD.
