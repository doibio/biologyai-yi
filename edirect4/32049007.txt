The antidiabetic drug phenformin displays potent anticancer activity in 
different tumors, but its mechanism of action remains elusive. Using Shh 
medulloblastoma as model, we show here that at clinically relevant 
concentrations, phenformin elicits a significant therapeutic effect through a 
redox-dependent but complex I-independent mechanism. Phenformin inhibits 
mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD), a component of the 
glycerophosphate shuttle, and causes elevations of intracellular NADH content. 
Inhibition of mGPD mimics phenformin action and promotes an association between 
corepressor CtBP2 and Gli1, thereby inhibiting Hh transcriptional output and 
tumor growth. Because ablation of CtBP2 abrogates the therapeutic effect of 
phenformin in mice, these data illustrate a biguanide-mediated redox/corepressor 
interplay, which may represent a relevant target for tumor therapy.
