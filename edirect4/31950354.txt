PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of metformin on serum lipid profiles in 
nondiabetic adults through a comprehensive meta-analysis.
METHODS: In the present meta-analysis, randomized and controlled trials were 
collected by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Libraries from inception to 
April 2019. Compared with placebos, the effects of metformin treatment on lipid 
profiles in nondiabetic adults were evaluated.
RESULTS: Forty-seven studies from 45 articles including 5731 participants were 
enrolled. Pooled results showed that metformin had significant effects on total 
cholesterol (mean change -6.57 mg/dl; 95% CI -9.66, -3.47; P = 0.000) and LDL-c 
(mean change -4.69 mg/dl; 95% CI -7.38, -2.00; P = 0.001), but insignificant 
effects on HDL-c (mean change -4.33 mg/dl; 95% CI -9.62, 0.96; P = 0.109) and 
triglyceride (mean change -0.85 mg/dl; 95% CI -0.36, 2.06; P = 0.169). 
Significant heterogeneities were found for all lipid profiles (HDL-c = 85.5%; 
LDL-c = 59.9%; total cholesterol = 75.3% and triglyceride = 67.1%). Different 
from the pooled data, in a subgroup analysis, the effect of metformin on 
triglyceride in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) was significant 
with a mean reduction of 8.15 mg/dl. In addition, sensitivity analysis showed 
that the pooled effects of metformin on serum lipid profiles were stable. 
Publication bias derived from funnel plots or Begg's tests (P = 0.933, 0.860, 
0.904, and 0.567 for HDL-c, LDL-c, total cholesterol, and triglyceride, 
respectively) was not significant.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis revealed that metformin could reduce total 
cholesterol and LDL-c in nondiabetic adults. In addition, metformin might exert 
a triglyceride-lowering effect in nondiabetics with PCOS status.
