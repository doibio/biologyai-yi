AIM: To determine the effects of individual and combined therapies on plasma 
insulin, glucagon, β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OH) and associated metabolites.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In DURATION-8, the combination of once-weekly exenatide 
(EQW) + 10 mg dapagliflozin (Dapa) in patients with type 2 diabetes poorly 
controlled with metformin-reduced HbA1c levels and body weight (at weeks 28 and 
52) was compared with EQW + placebo (Plb) or Dapa + Plb. The study included 678 
patients randomized 1:1:1 to EQW + Dapa, EQW + Plb, or Dapa + Plb. Plasma 
insulin and glucagon were measured at fasting and 2 hours after a mixed meal. 
Fasting plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and β-OH concentrations were measured.
RESULTS: The fasting insulin-to-glucagon molar ratio (I/Glg) increased with 
EQW + Plb only; postprandial I/Glg increased in all groups but significantly 
more with EQW + Plb. β-OH, FFA, and glycerol concentrations showed a parallel 
response: larger increments with Dapa + Plb, larger decrements with EQW + Plb, 
and intermediate changes with EQW + Dapa. β-OH levels and I/Glg were inversely 
related to one another. Patients in the top quartile of β-OH changes from 
baseline [median (interquartile range): +207 (305) vs. -65 (-154) μmol/L; 
P < .0001] were more frequently treated with Dapa + Plb, had higher urine 
glucose-to-creatinine ratios, and lower fasting insulin [52 (51) vs. 68 (53) 
pmol/L; P = .0013) and I/Glg [1.76 (1.49) vs. 2.23 (1.70) mol/mol; P = .0020]. 
Haematocrit increased only in the Dapa group.
CONCLUSIONS: The EQW + Dapa combination abolished the Dapa-induced rise in β-OH, 
reduced the EQW-induced increase in I/Glg, maintained glycosuria, and increased 
haematocrit in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The drug 
combination may preserve any putative benefits while mitigating the risk of 
ketoacidosis.
