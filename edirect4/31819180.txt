Window of opportunity trials exploit the 'window' of time after cancer 
diagnosis, typically prior to initiation of cancer therapy. In recent years this 
study design has become a more regular feature of drug development, as this 
'window' provides an opportunity to carry out a thorough pharmacodynamic 
assessment of a therapy of interest in tumours that are unperturbed by prior 
treatment. Many of the first window trials interrogated the bioactivity of drugs 
being repurposed for cancer treatment, in particular the anti-mitochondrial 
agent, metformin. In this review, we describe examples of window study designs 
that have been used to assess drugs that target cancer metabolism with a focus 
on metformin. In addition, we discuss how window studies may aid the development 
of molecular metabolic cancer imaging.
