Diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder that leads to various 
micro-vascular complications. The present study elucidated the effect of 
chloroform extract of leaves of Ficus glomerata (CHFG) in streptozotocin-induced 
early diabetic renal and neural complications. Wistar rats were injected with 
STZ (55 mg/kg, i.p.) to produce experimental diabetes. Two weeks after the 
stabilization of diabetes, CHFG extract at the dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg (CHFG 
200 and CHFG 400) and metformin at the dose of 250 mg/kg (Met 250) was 
administered to the diabetic rats for further two weeks. Diabetic rats showed an 
increase in blood glucose, plasma urea, uric acid, creatinine, triglyceride, and 
total cholesterol level. The change in behavioral parameters such as thermal 
hyperalgesia and cold allodynia with compromised sciatic nerve and kidney 
antioxidant status were seen in diabetic rats. Diabetic rats treated with CHFG 
200, CHFG 400, and Met 250 showed a decrease in blood glucose, plasma urea, uric 
acid, creatinine, triglyceride, and total cholesterol level. Also, it improved 
altered behavioral parameters such as thermal hyperalgesia and cold allodynia. 
It also restored the sciatic nerve and kidney antioxidant status. The results of 
kidney and sciatic nerves histopathological study were in line with the results 
of biochemical parameters that confirmed the favorable role of CHFG. 
Characterization of CHFG by LC-MS revealed the presence of diverse 
phytoconstituents, which might be responsible for its protective effect.
