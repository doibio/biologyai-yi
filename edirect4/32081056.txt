BACKGROUND: Capparis spinosa, Rosa canina, Securidaca securigera, Silybum 
marianum, Urtica dioica, Trigonella foenum-graecum and Vaccinium arctostaphylos 
are used traditionally as an herbal combination for treatment of diabetic 
patients in Iran. Despite the clinical evidence supporting their use in solitary 
form, no controlled human study has determined the efficacy and safety of their 
combination in treatment of diabetic patients.
METHODS: A total 150 type II diabetic patients of both sexes under the oral 
anti-hyperglycemic drugs treatment (maximum 10 mg glyburide and 1000 mg 
metformin daily) were randomly assigned to three groups. The patients in each 
group received either herbal combination or placebo or metformin capsule daily 
for three months, without any change in their previous oral anti-hyperglycemic 
drugs dosage. Herbal combination, placebo and metformin capsules matched by 
shape and color were prepared in the Institute of Medicinal Plants Karaj, Iran. 
To assess the efficacy and safety of the treatments, the patients fasting plasma 
glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, liver enzymes and renal function were determined 
at the beginning of the study and after three months.
RESULTS: Results showed that after three months, the fasting plasma glucose, 
HbA1c and cholesterol levels in herbal combination were decreased significantly 
as compared to placebo group (20% and 12% respectively) and also compared to 
base line (25% and 15% respectively). The herbal combination was as effective as 
metformin in reduction of FPG (p = 0.001, p = 0.001) and HbA1c (p = 0.028 and 
p = 0.050 respectively) compared to placebo. No notable hepatic, renal and 
gastrointestinal side effects were observed in the trial groups.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that traditional herbal combination may safely 
improve glycemic control in type II diabetic patients with no significant 
adverse effect. [Formula: see text].
