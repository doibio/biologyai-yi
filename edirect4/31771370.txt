Objective: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a prevalent health problem. Oral agents, 
with the exception of metformin, are often discontinued with the initiation of 
insulin. The objective was to understand the proportion of patients 
discontinuing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) and the reasons for 
the decision to discontinue.Methods: A retrospective study using a health claims 
database investigated discontinuation of DPP-4i in adult patients on a dual 
therapy of metformin and DPP-4i who initiated insulin (n = 3391). An online 
survey administered to 406 physicians in the US examined reasons for 
discontinuation. Physicians surveyed included endocrinologists (34.5%), general 
practitioners (32.5%), internal medicine specialists (30.5%), and diabetologists 
(2.5%), treating a monthly average of 154 patients.Results: Among patients 
treated with metformin and DPP-4is who were newly prescribed insulin, 33.3 and 
57.3% discontinued DPP-4i therapy within 3 and 12 months, respectively. Patients 
who discontinued DPP-4i therapy had higher out-of-pocket costs and a greater 
proportion of renal and liver disease. Top 3 responses for discontinuation 
included adverse events/tolerability issues (58.9%), lack of efficacy/treatment 
goals not being met (55.4%) and additional cost of DPP-4i with insulin (48.5%). 
Top 3 responses for continuing DPP-4i included meeting treatment goals (70.7%), 
using a lower dose of insulin (65.3%) and good tolerability (48.0%). Physician 
characteristics, such as physician specialty, age, gender and location impacted 
to some extent the reasons for treatment decisions.Conclusions: A large 
proportion of patients discontinue DPP-4is in the real world when initiating 
insulin. The impact of physician characteristics in treatment decisions 
highlights the need for enhanced physician training and support as new clinical 
data emerges and therapy options are available.
