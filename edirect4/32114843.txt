Aims: Epidemiologic studies have shown that individuals with diabetes have a 
higher risk of hepatic diseases which represent a true clinical problem. The 
purpose of the present study was to assess the possible modulatory effect of the 
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin 
on therapeutic efficiency of traditional antidiabetics, as metformin and 
gliclazide, regarding hepatic complications in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced 
diabetes in rats.Methods: Animals were divided into seven groups; normal control 
group, STZ control group (50 mg/kg, i.p., single dose), lovastatin group, 
metformin group, gliclazide group, lovastatin plus metformin group and 
lovastatin plus gliclazide group. Serum HMG-CoA reductase, in addition to serum 
alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as hepatocyte integrity loss markers, 
hepatic tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione 
reduced (GSH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 
catalase as oxidative stress markers, as well as serum tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and hepatic nitric oxide end 
products (NOx) as inflammatory markers were assessed, coupled with a 
confirmatory histopathological study.Results: The combined effect of lovastatin 
with metformin or gliclazide was significantly better than either drug alone 
regarding serum AST, ALP and TNF-α, and hepatic TBARS, GSH, GST, SOD and NOx 
levels.Conclusions: Hepatic complications associated with diabetes could be 
improved by combination of metformin or gliclazide with lovastatin.
