This study investigates the fabrication, characterization and optimization of 
Linum usitatissimum mucilage (LSM) with sodium alginate mucoadhesive 
microspheres loaded metformin HCl, a sustained release dosage form prepared by 
ionic gelation technique. The effect of changing the polymer ratio with drug was 
studied for drug encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release for 12 h. 
Drug entrapment efficiency of all formulations was in the range of 77.93 ± 3.67 
to 92.25 ± 4.08% with sustained release of 80 ± 0.12% to 88 ± 0.33% for 12 h. It 
followed Korsmeyers Peppas model (R2 = 0.9786-0.9964) with super case II 
transport mechanism. Average microsphere size of all formulations was within the 
range of 817-911 μm. SEM, FTIR were also characterized and swelling behavior of 
microspheres was affected by pH of buffer medium. These microspheres also showed 
good mucoadhesivity in wash off test. The optimized LSM-alginate mucoadhesive 
microspheres containing metformin HCl demonstrated significant hypoglycemic 
effect in alloxan-induced diabetic rats for prolonged period of time.
