Background: substandard and falsified medicines (SFMs) are a threat to public 
health. The availability of SFMs in Myanmar was reported by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) in 1999, but there have been few systematic surveys on 
falsified medicines in Myanmar since then. The aim of this study is to examine 
the extent of SFMs for sale in Myanmar. Methods: target medicines were tablets 
of candesartan, metformin, and pioglitazone, and infusions of ciprofloxacin and 
levofloxacin. Samples were collected from hospitals, pharmacies, and wholesalers 
located in the Mandalay region in 2015. We carried out observation testing, 
authenticity investigation, and quality testing to search for SFMs, and analyzed 
the relationship between SFMs and the price and store type. Results: There were 
no falsified medicines found in the authenticity check, though there remained a 
problem due to low response rates from manufacturers and regulatory authorities. 
In the quality test, some tablets of metformin and pioglitazone made in India 
failed the dissolution test. Conclusions: although no serious problems were 
found, some substandard medicines were detected. Regular surveys to monitor SFMs 
are therefore recommended, together with further regulatory guidance to improve 
conditions in all medicine manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies.
