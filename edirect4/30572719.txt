This study investigated the mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT4 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from type 2 diabetes patients with 
retinopathy (diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients) (n = 86) and those without 
retinopathy (n = 103). The mRNA expression of SIRT1 and SIRT3 was found to be 
significantly higher in diabetic patients with retinopathy compared to those 
without retinopathy. Notably, protein levels of SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT4 were 
higher in patients with DR compared with controls after adjusting for diabetes 
duration and taking metformin (p = .001 for SIRT1; p = .001 for SIRT3; p = .005 
for SIRT4). In the logistic model, there was a significant association between 
SIRT3 and DR (p = .0001) independent of age and sex and hyperglycaemia markers 
including FBS, HbA1c, and diabetic duration. These findings suggest an emerging 
role of sirtuins in the pathogenesis of retinopathy, but further studies are 
necessary to establish this concept.
