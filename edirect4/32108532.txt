INTRODUCTION: With the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), there is a 
substantial interest in novel, glucose-lowering drugs that may complement 
existing treatment options. Imeglimin is an oral antidiabetic agent currently in 
clinical development.
AREAS COVERED: This review is based on a literature search using PubMed and 
Embase including all published manuscripts and presentations concerning 
imeglimin. Supplementary information was retrieved from the manufacturer's 
official webpage. Preclinical and clinical data are summarized with a focus on 
mechanisms of action as well as clinical efficacy and safety in T2D.
EXPERT OPINION: Imeglimin's mode of action seems to be improved mitochondrial 
function in pancreatic beta cells leading to improved insulin secretion and 
lowering of plasma glucose levels. In clinical trials of up to 24 weeks, 
imeglimin in doses of 1,000-1,500 mg twice daily conferred modest reductions in 
glycates hemoglobin A1c of 6-11 mmol/mol (0.5-1.0%) (placebo-adjusted) as a 
monotherapy and 7 mmol/mol (0.6%) as an add-on therapy to metformin or 
sitagliptin in patients with T2D. Reported adverse effects were mainly 
gastrointestinal discomfort. The position of imeglimin among other 
pharmacotherapies in the treatment of T2D will be determined based on future 
studies more clearly outlining the safety and long-term cardiovascular effects.
