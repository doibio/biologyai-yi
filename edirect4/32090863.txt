Despite the availability of potent antitubercular drugs, tuberculosis (TB) still 
remains one of the world's leading causes of death. The current antitubercular 
therapy (ATT) suffers from a drawback of longer duration that imposes a major 
challenge of patient non compliance and resistance development. The current 
scenario necessitates alternative strategies with potential to shorten treatment 
duration that could pave the way for improved clinical outcomes. In recent 
years, host directed adjunctive therapies have raised considerable attention and 
emerged as a promising intervention which targets clinically relevant biological 
pathways in hosts to modulate pathological immune responses. Few of the approved 
drugs namely statins, metformin, ibuprofen, aspirin, valproic acid, adalimumab, 
bevacizumab, zileuton and vitamin D3 have shown promising results in clinical 
outcomes during their preliminary screening in TB patients and can be 
potentially repurposed as antitubercular drugs. This review highlights clinical 
and non clinical evidences of some already existing drug and their targets in 
hosts that could help in shortening treatment duration and reducing bacterial 
burden at minimal doses.
