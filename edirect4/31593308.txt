OBJECTIVES: Alterations of cellular metabolism have been implicated in immune 
dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSCC). Metformin has recently emerged as a candidate of interest for 
combination with immunotherapy in HNSCC. This study investigated the effect of 
metformin on immune cell infiltrates of HNSCC.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of T cell infiltrates in primary tumor specimens 
from patients enrolled in a clinical window of opportunity trial of presurgical 
metformin. Metformin was titrated to a standard diabetic dose (2000 mg/day) for 
a minimum of 9 days (mean 13.6 days) prior to surgical resection. Pre and 
posttreatment surgical specimens from 36 patients (16 HPV+ , 20 HPV- ) were 
comparatively analyzed. FOXP3+ and CD8+ immune cell infiltrates in the tumor and 
peritumoral stroma of pre and posttreatment HNSCC specimens were quantified by 
digital image analysis using Visiopharm software.
RESULTS: Metformin treatment was associated with a 41.4% decrease in FOXP3+ T 
cells in intratumor regions of interest (P = .004) and a 66.5% increase in 
stromal CD8+ T cells at the leading edge of the tumor (P = .021) when compared 
to pretreatment biopsies. This was reflected in increased CD8+ /FOXP3+ cell 
ratios within the tumor (P < .001) and stromal compartments (P < .001). The 
effects of metformin occurred independently of HPV status.
CONCLUSION: Metformin treatment may favorably alter the immune TME in HNSCC 
independent of HPV status.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1b. This study is most accurately described as a 
non-randomized controlled trial and therefore may reflect a level of evidence 
below 1b but above 2a from the provided "levels of evidence" chart.
