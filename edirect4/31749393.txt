Our aim is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety by comparing 
N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) with metformin administrated by polycystic ovary 
syndrome (PCOS) patients. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized 
clinical trials (RCTs). MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and China National 
Knowledge Infrastructure were searched for studies. 10 studies were considered 
eligible for inclusion. NAC significantly reduced BMI and total testosterone, 
there was no significant difference in pregnancy rate, serum LH level, fasting 
insulin, and LH/FSH ratio. In conclusions, NAC may be considered as an 
alternative supplement to metformin, but large-scale randomized controlled 
trials are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of NAC in PCOS patients.
