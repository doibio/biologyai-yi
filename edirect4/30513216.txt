Context: Metformin's effect on glycaemic control is well documented, but its 
effect on diabetes-induced testicular impairment has been scarcely 
reported.Objective: To investigate the effects of metformin on testicular 
oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, which largely contribute to 
fertility decline in diabetic state.Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
divided into 3 groups (n = 6/group) namely: normal control (NC), diabetic 
control (DC), and metformin (300 mg/kg b.w./d)-treated diabetic groups. 
Metformin was administrated for 4 weeks.Results: Decreased mRNA expressions and 
activities of antioxidant enzymes were seen in the testes of DC group. mRNA and 
protein expressions of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic markers increased, 
while interleukin-10 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) decreased in 
the testes of DC group. Treatment with metformin up-regulated antioxidant 
enzymes, down-regulated inflammation, and apoptosis and increased PCNA 
immunoexpression in the testes.Conclusions: Metformin protects the testes from 
diabetes-induced impairment and may improve male reproductive health in diabetic 
state.
