Metformin, a well-acknowledged biguanide, safety profile and multiaction drug 
with low cost for management of type 2 diabetes, makes a first-class candidate 
for repurposing. The off-patent drug draws huge attention for repositioned for 
anticancer drug delivery recently. Still few unanswered questions are 
challenging, among them one leading question; can metformin use as a generic 
therapy for all breast cancer subtypes? And is metformin able to get over the 
problem of drug resistance? The review focused on the mechanisms of metformin 
action specifically for breast cancer therapy and overcoming the resistance; 
also discusses preclinical and ongoing and completed clinical trials. The 
existing limitation such as therapeutic dose specifically for cancer treatment, 
resistance of metformin in breast cancer and organic cation transporters 
heterogeneity of the drug opens up a new pathway for improved understanding and 
successful application as repurposed effective chemotherapeutics for breast 
cancer. However, much more additional research is needed to confirm the accurate 
efficacy of metformin treatment for prevention of cancer and its recurrence.
