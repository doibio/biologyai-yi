BACKGROUND: The linear progression from normal colonic epithelium to adenoma 
initiation, carcinoma transformation and metastasis is considered the classical 
model of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Although metformin has been 
extensively reported to be negatively related to cancer incidence, the effect of 
metformin on CRC development remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the role of 
metformin in the entire CRC linear progression.
METHODS: Systematic searches and data extraction were performed in the PubMed, 
Embase, and Cochrane Library databases on Jan 31, 2019. The combined relative 
ratios (RRs) of colorectal tumor incidence and the hazard ratios (HRs) of 
overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were evaluated by a 
random-effects model. Then, the effects of metformin were further assessed 
through stratified analyses by population, medication duration and dosage, 
dose-response analysis and comparison with other antidiabetic agents.
RESULTS: A total of 50 studies consisting of 238,540 cases of diabetes mellitus 
(DM) were included in this study. Metformin use was negatively associated with 
the incidence of colorectal adenoma (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65-0.86) and CRC (RR: 
0.73, 95% CI: 0.58-0.90). Moreover, CRC patients benefited from metformin in 
terms of both OS (HR: 0.73, 95% Cl: 0.63-0.84) and CSS (HR: 0.60, 95% Cl: 
0.50-0.73). Stratified analyses suggested that a long duration of high-dose 
metformin (RR: 0.52, 95% Cl: 0.36-0.83) was more effective than a short duration 
in Asian populations against colorectal adenoma (RR: 0.66, 95% Cl: 056-0.70) and 
CRC (RR: 0.45, 95% Cl: 0.29-0.70). Interestingly, metformin use decreased CRC 
risk in a dose-dependent manner (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87-0.95). In addition, the 
benefit of metformin on CRC was more significant than that of other antidiabetic 
agents, including insulin.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of metformin is associated with a lower incidence of 
adenoma and CRC and a better prognosis, especially in Asian populations.
