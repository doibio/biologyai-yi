OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition 
of 10 or 25 mg of empagliflozin to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using 
a maximum tolerable dose of metformin and gliclazide.
METHODS: A total of 60 patients who had been receiving a maximum tolerable dose 
of metformin plus gliclazide. was divided into two groups in this study. In the 
first group (Group 1, n=32), 10 mg empagliflozin was added to the current 
treatment once a day, and in the second group (Group 2, n=28) 25 mg 
empagliflozin was added to the same treatment once a day. Biochemical results, 
weight and blood pressure changes of the patients in both groups were evaluated 
before and after 12 weeks of empagliflozin addition. Patients who developed 
urinary tract and genital infections after treatment were recorded.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c in both groups 
after empagliflozin treatment (Group 1, p<0.001 and Group2, p=0.001). When the 
lipid profile was evaluated, no significant difference was found between basal 
and post-treatment parameters (p>0.05). Patients in Group 1 and Group 2 lost 
2.6±1.2 and 3.8±2.0 kg of body weight, respectively (p<0.0001 for each). There 
were also significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure for 
groups 1 and 2 (p<0.0001 for each). Although there was a numerical increase in 
the urinary tract and genital infections in both groups after empagliflozin 
treatment, there was no statistically significant difference compared to the 
pre-treatment period (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Two doses of empagliflozin added to the present treatments showed a 
dose-independent improvement in glycemic control and a neutral effect on lipid 
metabolism.
