OBJECTIVES: Esophageal cancer is a highly fatal malignant neoplasm, with 2 
etiologically different histological types. A large prospective study is 
expected to elucidate the specific risk of the 90% subtype of esophageal cancer, 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), with metformin therapy. This study 
aims to determine the association between metformin use and incident ESCC risk.
METHODS: This was a nationwide population-based prospective cohort study 
conducted in Sweden in 2005-2015. Among 8.4 million participants identified in 
the cohort, 411,603 (5%) were metformin users. The users were compared with 10 
times as many frequency-matched nonusers of metformin (n = 4,116,030) by age and 
sex. Metformin use was treated as a time-varying variate, and multivariable 
cause-specific proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios 
(HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ESCC, adjusted for age, sex, 
calendar year, residence area, tobacco smoking, alcohol overconsumption, and use 
of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or statins.
RESULTS: The incidence rates of ESCC were 3.5 per 100,000 person-years among the 
metformin users and 5.3 per 100,000 person-years in the nonusers. Metformin 
users overall were at a decreased risk of ESCC compared with nonusers (HR 0.68, 
95% CI 0.54-0.85). The decrease in risk was more pronounced in new metformin 
users (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28-0.64) and participants aged 60-69 years (HR 0.45, 
95% CI 0.31-0.66).
DISCUSSION: Metformin use decreases the risk of developing ESCC.
