Metformin is a first line agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that can be 
used alone or in combination with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, 
incretin-based drugs, sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, or other 
hypoglycemic agents. Metformin has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations 
during therapy and is an exceeding rare cause of idiosyncratic clinically 
apparent acute liver injury.
