Background: Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) and metformin-induced 
lactic acidosis (MILA) remain controversial entities. Metformin toxic effect 
depends on accumulation to lead to lactic acidosis (LA), particularly during an 
episode of acute kidney injury (AKI). In MILA, no other condition contributing 
to LA is found. The aims of this study were to describe the characteristics and 
prognosis of AKI associated with LA in metformin users and to clarify the role 
of this drug in the different types of LA.Methods: We performed a French 
multicenter retrospective study in diabetic patients treated by metformin 
presenting with LA in a context of AKI in 2015. 126 nephrology units (NU) and 23 
intensive care units (ICU) were contacted. We individualized MILA and MALA 
patients in order to illustrate the role of metformin.Results: We included 173 
patients (109 MILA, 64 MALA). 103 patients presented without hemodynamic 
instability (82 MILA and 21 MALA) whereas 70 patients were shocked including 27 
MILA. The shock was associated with death with an odds ratio (OR) of 12.92 
(p < .001). Digestive disorders (DD) were strongly associated with MILA 
(p = .0001). MALA was significantly associated with shock (p < .0001). The 
mortality rate was higher in MALA (26%) when compared with MILA (7%). Dialysis 
performed in 133 patients was significantly associated with shock, kalemia, 
lactate and serum creatinine levels. In multivariate analysis, metformin level 
was independently associated with pH or lactate level only in MILA 
patients.Conclusions: MILA is associated with DD and death is due to severe 
refractory acidosis leading to cardiovascular collapse attributed to metformin 
accumulation mainly via AKI. MALA patients are more frequently shocked and death 
is related to their underlying condition, metformin accumulation increasing LA.
