AIMS: This trial was conducted to explore the protective effect on β-cell 
function of adding vitamin D3 to DPP-4 inhibitors to treat patients with latent 
autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).
METHODS: 60 LADA patients were randomized to group A (n = 21) - conventional 
therapy with metformin (1-1.7 g/day) and/or insulin treatment; group B (n = 20) 
- saxagliptin (5 mg/day) plus conventional therapy; and group C (n = 19) - 
vitamin D3 (2000 IU/day) plus saxagliptin and conventional therapy for 
12 months. Fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood samples were collected to 
measure blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and C-peptide levels at baseline 
and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment.
RESULTS: During the 12 months of follow-up, the levels of fasting C-peptide 
(FCP), 2-hour postprandial C-peptide (PCP) and the C-peptide index (CPI, serum 
C-peptide-to-plasma glucose level ratio) were maintained in group C. In contrast 
to those in group A and group B, FCP levels decreased significantly in group B, 
and CPI levels declined significantly in group A during the 1-year treatment 
(P < .05). Additionally, the levels of GADA titers in group C significantly 
decreased compared with those at baseline (P < .05), but no significant 
differences in GADA titers levels were detected in group A and group B. No 
significant differences were found among the three groups in the levels of FCP, 
PCP, the CPI or GADA titers.
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggested that adding 2000 IU/day vitamin D3 to 
saxagliptin might preserve β-cell function in patients with LADA.
