Membranes were fabricated from a blend of synthetic copolymer (thiourea, 
phenylhydrazine and formaldehyde) and chitosan to study the metformin drug 
release profile and its kinetics. The membranes were characterized with 
elemental, scanning electron microscopy, FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy to 
identify the empirical formula & weight, surface morphology and functional group 
changes occurred during the incorporation of chitosan to the copolymer. The 
swelling behaviour, drug loading efficiency and drug release profile of the 
membranes were studied using UV-visible spectroscopy. The mechanical properties 
and in vitro degradation studies were also performed. The reactive sites, better 
porosity and larger surface area provided by chitosan to the copolymer led to 
higher drug loading efficiency and controlled drug release profile. Kinetic 
study revealed swelling and diffusion controlled mechanism for the membranes, 
which obtained from Ritger-Peppas and Higuchi model. The chitosan and its 
copolymer membranes were tested for antimicrobial assay using selective 
gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial and fungal strains. The CS-TPF-drug 
membranes showed an acceptable control of the growth of all the microbial 
species compared to CS, CS-drug and the standard metformin drug.
