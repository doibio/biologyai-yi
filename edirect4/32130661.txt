INTRODUCTION: Many Chinese patients who are uncontrolled by oral antidiabetic 
drugs (OADs) receive short-term intensive insulin therapy (IIT) in hospital to 
rapidly relieve glucose-associated toxicity and to preserve/improve β-cell 
function. However, evidence for optimizing insulin algorithms for maintenance 
treatment after IIT is lacking. This study will compare the efficacy and safety 
of basal insulin-based treatment versus twice-daily premixed insulin in type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients after short-term in-hospital IIT.
METHODS: This 26-week randomized, multicenter, positive-controlled, open-label, 
parallel-group study will enroll approximately 400 male and female patients aged 
18-70 years with poorly-controlled T2DM (HbA1c > 7.5%) despite treatment with 
metformin plus at least one other OAD for 8 or more weeks. During a run-in 
period of 7-10 days, patients will be treated in-hospital with IIT comprising 
insulin glargine (Lantus®) once daily and insulin glulisine (Apidra®) three 
times daily; both regimens will be titrated daily to achieve the glycemic goal. 
Eligible patients will then be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to insulin glargine 
plus OADs or twice-daily premixed insulin (NovoLog® Mix 70/30) for 24 weeks, 
with metformin maintained throughout the study in both treatment groups. The 
primary endpoint is HbA1c change from baseline to week 24. Secondary endpoints 
include assessment of fasting plasma glucose, total daily insulin dose, 
hypoglycemia incidence, body weight change, adverse events, and patient 
satisfaction.
DISCUSSION: Given the current lack of clinical data, this study will provide 
evidence supporting safe and effective glycemic control using basal insulin 
glargine-based therapy plus OADs compared with twice-daily premixed insulin in 
Chinese patients with T2DM after short-term IIT. This will assist physicians by 
providing a wider choice of treatments.
