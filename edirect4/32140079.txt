BACKGROUND: To investigate the long-term economic outcome of dapagliflozin 
versus metformin in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) whose 
diet and exercise have not provided sufficient glycemic control.
METHODS: An economic analysis of dapagliflozin versus metformin was conducted by 
using the Chinese Outcomes Model for T2DM with a time horizon of lifetime, which 
was developed and validated based on the Chinese population. The efficacy data 
of lowering HbA1c of dapagliflozin and metformin was derived from a network 
meta-analysis. Other clinical, cost and utility inputs were obtained from 
published sources. Lifetime discounted quality-adjusted life-years, cost, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were measured. The uncertainty was 
facilitated by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The comparison of metformin and dapagliflozin in Chinese patients with 
insufficient glycemic control by diet and exercise showed that dapagliflozin was 
more costly and produced fewer health benefits in our simulated cohort. The 
sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin is not likely to be cost-effective compared with 
metformin for Chinese patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and 
exercise.
