The tryptophan metabolite kynurenine increases with aging and inflammation, and 
appears to contribute directly to the development and progression of several 
age-related conditions. Kynurenine is now known to signal through the aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) to modulate levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
The Ahr promoter region contains several sites for NF-kB binding, indicating 
that inflammation is a key factor modulating Ahr expression. Furthermore, 
kynurenine activation of Ahr is observed to stimulate expression of the enzyme 
IDO1, which generates kynurenine by degrading tryptophan, representing a 
positive feedback loop that may link inflammation with ROS production. On the 
other hand, the antioxidant system-inducing transcription factor Nrf2 can be 
stimulated by Ahr, and Nrf2 can itself activate Ahr expression. The balance 
between pro- and antioxidant functions of Ahr mediated by kynurenine may 
therefore regulate healthy versus unhealthy aging in different tissues and organ 
systems. Potential therapeutic approaches to target this pathway include 
exercise to alter kynurenine production or molecules such as metformin or 
resveratrol that may suppress Ahr activity.
