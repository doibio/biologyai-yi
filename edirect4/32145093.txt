AIM: To investigate the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia over the past 10 
years, taking into account changes in anti-hyperglycaemic therapy.
METHODS: This retrospective population-based study used German health insurance 
data. All adults diagnosed with documented type 2 diabetes (extrapolated to the 
German population: 6.6 million in 2006; 7.9 million in 2011; 8.86 million in 
2016) were screened for severe hypoglycaemia. Anti-hyperglycaemic agents were 
identified by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code.
RESULTS: The event rate for severe hypoglycaemia was 460 per 100 000 people in 
2006, 490 per 100 000 in 2011 and 360 per 100 000 in 2016. The proportion of 
people with severe hypoglycaemia receiving sulfonylureas, as well as receiving 
combination therapy of metformin and sulfonylureas decreased from 2006 to 2016 
(23.6% vs. 6.2%) Among those with severe hypoglycaemia in 2006, there were no 
prescriptions for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) 
agonists. The proportions of people with severe hypoglycaemia receiving DPP-4 
inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 agonists in 2011 and 2016 were low. 
The proportion of people receiving human insulin also decreased (from 11.3% in 
2006 to 10.3% in 2011 and 4.3% in 2016); the proportion of people receiving 
insulin analogues increased from 5.4% in 2006 to 11.5% in 2016. Therapy with 
mixed insulins was used by 19.7% of people with severe hypoglycaemia in 2006, by 
14.0% in 2011 and by 7.3% in 2016. People undergoing therapy with insulin 
analogues have the highest risk of severe hypoglycaemia adjusted by age, gender, 
nephropathy diagnosis and year of survey [odds ratio (OR) 14.4, 95% confidence 
interval (95% CI) 13.5-15.5].
CONCLUSION: The incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events in Germany increased 
between 2006 and 2011, and decreased in 2016.
