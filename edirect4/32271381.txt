OBJECTIVE: The lipid profile represents a driver of cardiovascular risk in type 
2 diabetes. The effect of chronic insulin therapy on cholesterol levels is 
unclear. We aim to evaluate the effect of basal insulin on lipid profile 
compared to other classes of antihyperglycemic agents in type 2 diabetic 
patients.
DESIGN: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reporting 
changes of lipid parameters in type 2 diabetic patients randomly assigned to 
basal insulin or other classes of anti-hyperglycemic agents.
RESULTS: The levels of total (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) appeared to be significantly reduced by therapies with glucagon-like 
peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in comparison to basal insulin (mean 
difference [MD] -3.80; 95% CI [-6.30 to -1.30] mg/dL, P < .001 and -4.17; 95% CI 
[-6.04 to -2.30] mg/dL, P < .0001), whereas no difference was detected between 
basal insulin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4-I) or standard therapy 
(sulfonylurea ± metformin). Thiazolidinediones (TZD) produced a significant 
improvement in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MD 3.55; 95% CI: 
0.55 to 6.56 mg/dL, P = .02) but were associated with an increase in TC and 
LDL-C (MD 16.20; 95% CI: 9.09 to 23.31 mg/dL, P < .001 and 5.19: 95% CI: -3.00 
to 13.39 mg/dL, P = .21). Basal insulin was superior to standard therapy in 
triglyceride reduction (MD 3.8; 95% CI: 0.99 to 6.63 mg/dL, P = .008).
CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1RA were superior to basal insulin in the control of TC and 
LDL-C. Basal insulin effectively reduced serum triglycerides. TZD led to 
improvement in HDL-C. DPP4-I and standard therapy did not have any significant 
effect on lipid levels.
