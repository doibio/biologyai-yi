The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the changing face of 
paediatric type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Paediatric diabetes is on the 
rise, with extensive research dedicated to understanding its pathophysiology, 
comorbidities and complications. As obesity continues to increase among all 
youth, differentiating between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes has become 
increasingly difficult but remains important for optimising treatment, 
anticipating complications and predicting disease risk. Novel treatments are 
emerging, with the ultimate goal being to achieve glycaemic control, limit 
weight gain, improve quality of life and reduce comorbidities. In this review, 
we focus on updates regarding the epidemiology, clinical presentation, 
comorbidities and complications of paediatric type 1 diabetes and type 2 
diabetes and conclude with current and emerging treatments.
