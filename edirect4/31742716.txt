Gestational diabetes mellitus is a condition similar to type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) in that patients are unable to compensate for the degree of insulin 
resistance, and both conditions are often treated with metformin. The 
comparative pharmacodynamic response to metformin in these 2 populations has not 
been studied. This study characterized insulin sensitivity, β-cell responsivity, 
and disposition index following a mixed-meal tolerance test utilizing a minimal 
model of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide kinetics before and during treatment 
with metformin. The study included women with gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 
34), T2DM (n = 14), and healthy pregnant women (n = 30). Before treatment, the 
gestational diabetes mellitus group had significantly higher baseline (45%), 
dynamic (68%), static (71%), and total β-cell responsivity (71%) than the T2DM 
group. Metformin significantly increased insulin sensitivity (51%) as well as 
disposition index (97%) and decreased mixed-meal tolerance test peak glucose 
concentrations (8%) in women with gestational diabetes mellitus after adjustment 
for gestational age-dependent effects; however, in women with T2DM metformin 
only significantly affected peak glucose concentrations (22%) and had no 
significant effect on any other parameters. Metformin had a greater effect on 
the change in disposition index (Δ disposition index) in women with gestational 
diabetes mellitus than in those with T2DM (P = .01). In conclusion, response to 
metformin in women with gestational diabetes mellitus is significantly different 
from that in women with T2DM, which is likely related to the differences in 
disease severity.
