AIMS: Our study aimed to analyse treatment strategies after failure of initial 
metformin mono-therapy in adult patients with type-2 diabetes (T2DM).
METHODS: The DIVE and DPV databases were combined and 16,681 adult patients with 
T2DM and metformin mono-therapy identified. Patients were analysed depending on 
whether metformin was continued (MET), or whether it was combined with other 
oral antidiabetics (OAD), with GLP-1 antagonists (GLP-1) or with basal insulin 
(BOT/BOT plus). Metabolic control, body weight and hypoglycaemia, micro- and 
macro-vascular events were compared within 1 year.
RESULTS: A total of 11,911 (71%) participants continued MET until the end of the 
observation period, 3334 (20.0%) were intensified using OAD, 579 (3%) started on 
GLP-1, and 857 (5%) were initiated on BOT/BOTplus. Predictors of OAD and 
BOT/BOTplus therapy were elevated HbA1c, longer diabetes duration and the 
presence of micro- and macro-vascular diseases, while GLP-1 therapy was 
predicted by younger age, female sex, higher body weight and shorter diabetes 
duration. Micro- and macro-vascular diseases were negative predictors of GLP-1 
therapy. Effects on HbA1c were highest in the BOT/BOTplus and OAD group, while 
GLP-1 treatment had the best effect on body weight.
CONCLUSIONS: BOT/BOTplus and OAD show good HbA1c reduction even in patients with 
longer diabetes duration and in older patients. GLP-1 therapy is effective 
concerning weight loss in overweight patients and is more often used in females 
and patients with shorter diabetes duration. Interestingly, despite several 
studies showing positive effects on micro- and macro-vascular outcomes, 
prevalent macro-vascular diseases are no predictors of GLP-1 use.
