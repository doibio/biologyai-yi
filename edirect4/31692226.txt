AIM: To assess the efficacy of exenatide (EXE) once weekly + dapagliflozin once 
daily (DAPA) versus each drug alone in reducing biomarkers of fatty 
liver/steatosis and fibrosis in a post hoc analysis of DURATION-8, a 104-week 
study in 695 patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by metformin 
monotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the impact of the study treatments on 
non-invasive markers of hepatic steatosis (fatty liver index [FLI] and 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] liver fat score), fibrosis (fibrosis-4 
index [FIB-4]) and severe fibrosis (NAFLD fibrosis score), along with liver 
enzymes and insulin resistance, at weeks 28 and 52. All outcomes in this 
analysis were exploratory, with nominal P values reported.
RESULTS: At week 28, biomarkers of fatty liver/steatosis and fibrosis were 
reduced from baseline in all treatment groups. At week 28, EXE once weekly + 
DAPA effects for decrease in FLI were stronger than those of EXE once weekly + 
placebo (PLB; -2.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.11, -0.73; P = 0.0092) or 
DAPA+PLB (-2.77 [95% CI -4.93, -0.62]; P = 0.0119), and stronger than those of 
EXE once weekly + PLB at week 52 (-3.23 [95% CI -5.79, -0.68]; P = 0.0134). 
FIB-4 showed reduction versus baseline only in the EXE once weekly + DAPA group 
at both week 28 (-0.06 [95% CI -0.11, -0.01]; P = 0.0135) and week 52 (-0.05 
[95% CI -0.09, -0.004]; P = 0.0308).
CONCLUSIONS: The EXE once weekly + DAPA combination showed stronger effects than 
EXE once weekly + PLB or DAPA + PLB in ameliorating markers of hepatic steatosis 
and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Prospective trials are needed to 
validate these findings.
