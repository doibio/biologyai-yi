AIM OF THE STUDY: Metformin is recommended as the first-line treatment of type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Despite its common use, few studies have been conducted to 
precisely measure the efficacy of metformin versus placebo as a first-line 
treatment. This study aims to assess the precise effects of metformin 
monotherapy on glycemic control and weight in drug-naive patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: Medline® and Cochrane databases were searched until March 19, 2016 to 
perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized 
trials evaluating metformin monotherapy in drug-naive patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Assessed outcomes include glycemic control (fasting plasma 
glucose, glycosated hemoglobin) and weight.
RESULTS: Overall, 16 studies (1140 patients) were selected. Compared to placebo, 
metformin monotherapy was associated with decreased glycosated hemoglobin by 
0.95% at 3 months (95% CI: 0.50 to 1.39, I2=87%) and 1.32% at 6 months (95% CI: 
1.01 to 1.62, I2=71%), and decreased fasting plasma glucose by 1.92mmol/L at 1 
month (95% CI: 0.11 to 3.74, I2=88%), 1.79mmol/L at 3 months (95% CI: 0.92 to 
2.66, I2=88%) and 2.14mmol/L at 6 months (95% CI: 1.17 to 3.12, I2=82%). No 
significant difference was demonstrated for the comparisons of weight due to 
relatively small number of studies retrieved from the literature resulting in 
insufficient statistical power.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the precise effects of metformin monotherapy 
regarding the decreases in fasting plasma glucose and glycosated hemoglobin that 
physician can expected in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. No 
evidence was found for the effects on weight.
