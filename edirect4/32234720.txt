OBJECTIVE: 1) To examine trends in the use of diabetes medications and 2) to 
determine whether physicians individualize diabetes treatment as recommended by 
the American Diabetes Association (ADA).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional 
analysis of 2003-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
data. We included people ≥18 years who had ever been told they had diabetes, had 
an HbA1c >6.4%, or had a fasting plasma glucose >125 mg/dL. Pregnant women and 
patients aged <20 years receiving only insulin were excluded. We assessed trends 
in use of ADA's seven preferred classes from 2003-2004 to 2015-2016. We also 
examined use by hypoglycemia risk (sulfonylureas, insulin, and meglitinides), 
weight effect (sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones [TZDs], insulin, and 
meglitinides), cardiovascular benefit (canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and 
liraglutide), and cost (brand-name medications and insulin analogs).
RESULTS: The final sample included 6,323 patients. The proportion taking any 
medication increased from 58% in 2003-2004 to 67% in 2015-2016 (P < 0.001). Use 
of metformin and insulin analogs increased, while use of sulfonylureas, TZDs, 
and human insulin decreased. Following the 2012 ADA recommendation, the choice 
of drug did not vary significantly by older age, weight, or presence of 
cardiovascular disease. Patients with low HbA1c, or HbA1c <6%, and age ≥65 years 
were less likely to receive hypoglycemia-inducing medications, while older 
patients with comorbidities were more likely. Insurance, but not income, was 
associated with the use of higher-cost medications.
CONCLUSIONS: Following ADA recommendations, the use of metformin increased, but 
physicians generally did not individualize treatment according to patients' 
characteristics. Substantial opportunities exist to improve pharmacologic 
management of diabetes.
