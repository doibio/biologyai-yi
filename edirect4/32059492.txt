Sperm cryopreservation is an assisted reproductive technique routinely used in 
canine species for genetic conservation. However, during cryopreservation, the 
DNA damages are still elevated, limiting the fertilization rate. The present 
study was conducted to evaluate whether supplementation of canine semen extender 
with a molecule limiting the metabolic activities can improve the quality of 
frozen-thawed canine spermatozoa. We used metformin, known to limit the 
mitochondrial respiratory and limit the oxidative stress. Before and during the 
freezing procedure, metformin (50µM and 500µM) has been added to the extender. 
After thawing, sperm exposed to metformin conserved the same viability without 
alteration in the membrane integrity or acrosome reaction. Interestingly, 50µM 
metformin improved the sperm motility in comparison to the control, subsequently 
increasing mitochondrial activity and NAD+ content. In addition, the oxidative 
stress level was reduced in sperm treated with metformin improving the sperm 
quality as measured by a different molecular marker. In conclusion, we have 
shown that metformin is able to improve the quality of frozen-thawed dog semen 
when it is used during the cryopreservative procedure.
