A fixed-dose combination (FDC) of ertugliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and immediate-release metformin is approved for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States and European Union. 
Four open-label, randomized, 2-period, single-dose, crossover studies were 
conducted under fasted conditions in healthy subjects to demonstrate 
bioequivalence of the ertugliflozin/metformin FDC tablets and coadministration 
of the individual components at respective strengths. In each study, 32 or 34 
subjects received an ertugliflozin/metformin FDC tablet (2.5 mg/500 mg, 
7.5 mg/850 mg, or 7.5 mg/1000 mg) and the respective doses of individual 
components (ertugliflozin with US- or EU-sourced metformin [Glucophage]). Plasma 
samples for ertugliflozin and metformin concentrations were collected for 
72 hours in each period. For both ertugliflozin and metformin, the 90% 
confidence intervals for the adjusted geometric mean ratio 
(FDC : coadministration) for area under the plasma concentration-time profile 
from time zero extrapolated to infinity and maximum observed plasma 
concentration were within acceptance criteria for bioequivalence. The majority 
of adverse events were mild in intensity. The studies demonstrated that each 
strength of FDC tablet is bioequivalent to respective doses of coadministered 
individual components, supporting that safety and efficacy can be bridged to the 
individual components used in phase 3 studies evaluating ertugliflozin in 
combination with metformin.
