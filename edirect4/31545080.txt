OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Juglans regia 
(JR) extract on hyperglycaemia and insulin sensitivity.
METHODS: Forty rats were divided into 4 groups: Control (C), Diabetes Control 
(DC), Diabetes + Juglans regia (D + JR) and Diabetes + Metformin (D + M).
RESULTS: In the D + JR group, Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels decreased from 
day 14 onwards. There was a significant decrease in plasma levels of Fibronectin 
Type III Domain Containing 5 (FNDC5) and adiponectin (ADP) in the DC group 
compared to the C group (p < .01, p < .001 respectively). In the D + JR group, 
there was a significant increase in plasma FNDC5 and ADP (p < .05), while the 
plasma Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were decreased compared to 
the DC group (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the present study found that JR and its bioactive 
components alleviated insulin resistance by increasing ADP and FNDC5 and 
decreasing FBG in a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ) + nicotinamide 
(NAD)-induced type 2 diabetes (T2D).HighlightsJuglans regia extract increased 
insulin sensitivity.Juglans regia extract significantly reduced the level of 
fasting blood glucose.Juglans regia extract reduced TNF-α levels in rats with 
type 2 diabetes.Juglans regia extract prevent weight loss in type 2 diabetes.
