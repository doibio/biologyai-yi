AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Intra-abdominal or visceral obesity is associated with insulin 
resistance and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to 
compare the effects of semaglutide 1.0 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg on body 
composition in a subset of participants from the SUSTAIN 8 Phase IIIB, 
randomised double-blind trial who underwent whole-body dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scanning.
METHODS: Adults (age ≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c 53-91 mmol/mol 
(7.0-10.5%), on a stable daily dose of metformin (≥1500 mg or maximum tolerated 
dose) and with an eGFR ≥60 ml min-1 [1.73 m]-2 were randomised 1:1 to 
semaglutide 1.0 mg once weekly and canagliflozin placebo once daily, or 
canagliflozin 300 mg once daily and semaglutide placebo once weekly. Body 
composition was assessed using whole-body DXA scans. The study participants and 
investigator remained blinded throughout the trial, and quality of DXA scans was 
evaluated in a blinded manner. Change from baseline to week 52 in total fat mass 
(kg) was the confirmatory efficacy endpoint.
RESULTS: A subset of 178 participants (semaglutide, n = 88; canagliflozin, 
n = 90) underwent DXA scanning at screening and were randomised into the 
substudy. Of these, 114 (semaglutide, n = 53; canagliflozin, n = 61) 
participants had observed end-of-treatment data included in the confirmatory 
efficacy analysis. Of the 178 participants in the substudy, numerical 
improvements in body composition (including fat mass, lean mass and visceral fat 
mass) were observed after 52 weeks with both treatments. Total fat mass 
(baseline 33.2 kg) was reduced by 3.4 kg and 2.6 kg with semaglutide and 
canagliflozin, respectively (estimated treatment difference: -0.79 [95% CI 
-2.10, 0.51]). Although total lean mass (baseline 51.3 kg) was also reduced by 
2.3 kg and 1.5 kg with semaglutide and canagliflozin, respectively (estimated 
treatment difference: -0.78 [-1.61, 0.04]), the proportion of lean mass 
(baseline 59.4%) increased by 1.2%- and 1.1%-point, respectively (estimated 
treatment difference 0.14 [-0.89, 1.17]). Changes in visceral fat mass and 
overall changes in body composition (assessed by the fat to lean mass ratio) 
were comparable between the two treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes on 
stable-dose metformin therapy, the changes in body composition with semaglutide 
and canagliflozin were not significantly different. Although numerical 
improvements in body composition were observed following treatment in both 
treatment arms, the specific impact of both treatments on body composition in 
the absence of a placebo arm is speculative at this stage.
