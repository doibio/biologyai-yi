ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Dacryodes edulis L. is an evergreen tree 
indigenous to western and eastern Africa which is utilized for nutritional and 
medicinal purposes. Folklorically, different parts of the tree are used in 
treating and managing diabetes and its complications.
AIMS: The antidiabetic effect of the butanol fraction of D. edulis ethanol 
extract (BFDE) was studied in fructose-streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetic 
rats.
METHODS: The ethanol extract was fractionated to yield the hexane, 
dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, butanol and aqueous fractions. The in vitro 
antidiabetic activities of the fractions were determined by their ability to 
inhibit α-glucosidase activity. BDFE was the most active and showed no cytotoxic 
effect while stimulating glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Thus, selected for 
in vivo study. Diabetic rats were grouped into 4. The negative control group was 
administered water only, another group was treated with metformin (200 mg/kg 
bodyweight), while the other groups were administered BDFE at 150 and 300 mg/kg 
bodyweight respectively. Two other groups consisting of normal rats were given 
water and BFDE (300 mg/kg bodyweight) respectively, with the former serving as 
normal control. After 6 weeks of intervention, the rats were humanely sacrificed 
using appropriate anaesthesia.
RESULTS: Treatment with the fraction significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the blood 
glucose level of the diabetic rats, with concomitant increase in serum insulin 
secretion. It also caused significant (p < 0.05) elevation of reduced 
glutathione level, superoxide dismutase, catalase, α-amylase, and ATPase 
activities, with concomitant depletion in myeloperoxidase activity, NO and MDA 
levels of the serum and pancreas. The pancreatic morphology and β-cell function 
were significantly improved in BFDE-treated rats, with restoration of the 
pancreatic capillary networks. Treatment with BFDE significantly (p < 0.05) 
inhibited the activities of glycogen phosphorylase, fructose 1,6 biphosphatase, 
glucose 6 phosphatase, and acetylcholinesterase, while suppressing the 
expression of Nrf2. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of gallic acid, vanillic 
acid, vanillin, and (-)-epicatechin in the fraction.
CONCLUSION: These results portray the antidiabetic and antioxidative properties 
of BFDE, which may be a synergistic consequence of the identified phenolics.
