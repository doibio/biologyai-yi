The poor survival rate of pancreatic cancer is still a major challenge for the 
clinicians and their patients. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of 
metformin, an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, in combination with LW6, 
which impairs malate dehydrogenase 2 activities, in treating pancreatic cancer 
cells. We observed that this combinational therapy significantly reduced cell 
proliferation, migration, and significantly induced cell death when compared to 
cells treated by each monotherapy or Sham. In addition, we found that the 
combination of metformin and LW6 increased the phosphorylation of yes-associated 
protein 1 at serine 127 and attenuated the nuclear localization of this 
transcription factor. This combinatorial treatment also decreased the level of 
cellular yes-associated protein 1. This suggests that metformin in combination 
with LW6 impairs pancreatic cancer cells and reduces nuclear localization of 
yes-associated protein 1.
