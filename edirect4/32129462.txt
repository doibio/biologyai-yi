Aging-related illnesses are increasing and effective strategies to prevent 
and/or treat them are lacking. This is because of a poor understanding of 
therapeutic targets. Low-grade inflammation is often higher in older adults and 
remains a key risk factor of aging-related morbidities and mortalities. Emerging 
evidence indicates that abnormal (dysbiotic) gut microbiome and dysfunctional 
gut permeability (leaky gut) are linked with increased inflammation in older 
adults. However, currently available drugs do not treat aging-related microbiome 
dysbiosis and leaky gut, and little is known about the cellular and molecular 
processes that can be targeted to reduce leaky gut in older adults. Here, we 
demonstrated that metformin, a safe Food and Drug Administration-approved 
antidiabetic drug, decreased leaky gut and inflammation in high-fat diet-fed 
older obese mice, by beneficially modulating the gut microbiota. In addition, 
metformin increased goblet cell mass and mucin production in the obese older 
gut, thereby decreasing leaky gut and inflammation. Mechanistically, metformin 
increased the goblet cell differentiation markers by suppressing Wnt signaling. 
Our results suggest that metformin can be used as a regimen to prevent and treat 
aging-related leaky gut and inflammation, especially in obese individuals and 
people with western-style high-fat dietary lifestyle, by beneficially modulating 
gut microbiome/goblet cell/mucin biology.
