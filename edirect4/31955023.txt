The presence of micropollutants in surface water is a potential threat for the 
production of high quality and safe drinking water. Adsorption of 
micropollutants onto granular activated carbon (GAC) in fixed-bed filters is 
often applied as a polishing step in the production of drinking water. Activated 
carbon can act as a carrier material for biofilm, hence biodegradation can be an 
additional removal mechanism for micropollutants in GAC filters. To assess the 
potential of biofilm to biodegrade micropollutants, it is necessary to 
distinguish adsorption from biodegradation as a removal mechanism. We performed 
experiments at 5 °C and 20 °C with biologically active and autoclaved GAC to 
assess the biodegradation of micropollutants by the biofilm grown on the GAC 
surface. Ten micropollutants were selected as model compounds. Three of them, 
iopromide, iopamidol and metformin, were biodegraded by the GAC biofilm. 
Additionally, we observed that temperature can increase or decrease adsorption, 
depending on the micropollutant studied. Finally, we compared the adsorption 
capacity of GAC used for more than 100,000 bed volumes and fresh GAC. We 
demonstrated that used GAC shows a higher adsorption capacity for guanylurea, 
metformin and hexamethylenetetramine and only a limited reduction in adsorption 
capacity for diclofenac and benzotriazole compared to fresh GAC.
