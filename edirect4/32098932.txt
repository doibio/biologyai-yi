Male obesity is associated with subfertility and increased disease risk of 
offspring. It is unknown if effects can be reversed through pharmacological 
interventions. Five- to 6-week-old C57BL6 male mice were fed control diet (n = 
10, CD) or high-fat diet (n = 20, HFD) for 16 weeks. Animals fed with a HFD were 
then allocated to continuation of HFD (n = 8) or HFD with metformin 28 mg kg-1 
day-1 (n = 8) for 6 weeks. Animals fed with CD continued on a CD (n = 9). Males 
were mated with fertile C57BL6 females for the assessment of pregnancy and fetal 
growth. Sperm motility, spermatozoa and testicular morphology, sperm-zona 
pellucida binding, sperm reactive oxygen species (ROS) (intracellular [DCFDA], 
superoxide [MSR], and oxidative DNA lesions [8OHdG]), and mitochondrial membrane 
potential (JC1) were assessed. Metformin treatment of HFD males improved glucose 
tolerance (+12%, P < 0.05) and reduced Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin 
Resistance (HOMA-IR; -36%, P < 0.05). This occurred in the absence of a change 
in body weight or adiposity. Metformin treatment of HFD-fed males restored 
testicular morphology (+33%, P < 0.05), sperm motility (+66%, P < 0.05), 
sperm-zona pellucida binding (+25%, P < 0.05), sperm intracellular ROS 
concentrations (-32%, P < 0.05), and oxidative DNA lesions (-45%, P < 0.05) to 
the levels of the CD males. Metformin treatment of HFD fathers increased fetal 
weights and lengths compared with those born to HFD fathers (+8%, P < 0.05), 
with fetal lengths restored to those of fetuses of CD males. Short-term 
metformin treatment in men who are obese could be a potential intervention for 
the treatment of subfertility, without the need for a reduction in body 
weight/adiposity.
