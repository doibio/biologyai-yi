The FDA has recently endorsed metformin use in patients with T2D and stage 3 CKD 
(CKD3). However, metformin safety in elderly individuals is unknown. The aim of 
this study was to identify frequency and risk factors of lactic acid (LA) 
elevation in ambulatory elderly male US veterans with stable diabetic CKD3 
treated with metformin. We studied 92 patients with non-diabetic CKD3 (Group1), 
diabetic CKD3 not on metformin (Group2) and diabetic CKD3 on metformin (Group 
3). Mean LA levels were similar at 1.3 ± 0.3 and 1.3 ± 0.4 mmol/L in Groups 1 
and 2, respectively; while, LA was significantly higher in Group 3 
(2.1 ± 1.0 mmol/L, P < .001). Only 1 patient in each Groups 1 (4%) and 2 (4%) 
had hyperlactatemia (LA > 2.0 mmol/L), as compared with 17 (42.5%) patients in 
Group 3 (P < .05). No differences in age, BMI, eGFR, metformin dosage, and HbA1c 
were seen in Group 3 patients with and without hyperlactatemia. In the 
multivariate logistic regression analyses, metformin use was the only factor 
significantly associated with hyperlactatemia (adjusted OR 25.48, P < .005). In 
conclusion, metformin therapy is associated with increased risk of 
hyperlactatemia in elderly men with diabetic CKD3.
