AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a eukaryotic energy sensor and protector 
from mitochondrial/energetic stress that is also a therapeutic target for cancer 
and metabolic disease. Metformin is an AMPK inducer that has been used in cancer 
therapeutic trials. Through screening we isolated cetylpyridinium chloride 
(CPC), a drug known to dose-dependently inhibit mitochondrial complex 1, as a 
potent and dose-dependent AMPK stimulator. Mitochondrial biogenesis and 
bioenergetics changes have also been implicated in glioblastoma, which is the 
most aggressive form of brain tumors. Cetylpyridinium chloride has been 
administered in humans as a safe drug-disinfectant for several decades, and we 
report here that under in vitro conditions, cetylpyridinium chloride kills 
glioblastoma cells in a dose dependent manner at a higher efficacy compared to 
current standard of care drug, temozolomide.
