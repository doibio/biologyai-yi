General practice (GP) level analysis shows that patients' own perceptions of 
support within primary care as reported in the GP patient survey (GPPS) are as 
important as medication and services in improving glycaemic control.

BACKGROUND: The way that GP practices organize their services impacts as much on 
glycaemia in type 2 diabetes as does prescribing.
AIM: Our aim was to evaluate the link between patients' own perception of 
support within primary care and the % patients at each GP practice at target 
glycaemic control (TGC) and at high glycaemic risk (HGR).
DESIGN AND SETTING: Utilisation of National Diabetes Audit (NDA) available data 
combined with the General practitioner patient survey (GPPS).
METHOD: The NDA 2016_17 published data on numbers of type 2 patients, levels of 
local diabetes services and the target glycaemic control (TGC) % and high 
glycaemic risk (HGR) % achieved. The GPPS 2017 published % "No" responses from 
long term condition (LTC) patients to the question "In the last 6 months, had 
you enough support from local services or organisations to help manage LTCs?". 
Multivariate regression was used on the set of indicators capturing patients' 
demographics and services provided.
RESULTS: 6498 practices were included (with more than 2.5 million T2DM patients) 
and median values with band limits that included 95% practices for % "No" 
response to the question above was 12% (2%-30%), for TGC 67% (54%-78%) and for 
HGR 6% (2%-13%). The model accounted for 25% TGC variance and 26% HGR variance. 
The standardised β values shown as (TGC/HGR) (+=more people; -=less people) for 
older age (+0.24/-0.25), sulphonylurea use (-0.21/+0.14), greater social 
disadvantage (-0.09/+0.21), GPPS Support %No (-0.08/+0.12), %Completion 8 checks 
(+0.09/-0.12) and metformin use (+0.11/-0.05).
CONCLUSION: The relation between the person with diabetes and clinician in 
primary care is shown to be quantitatively potentially as important in 
influencing glycaemic outcome as the services provided and medication 
prescribed. We suggest that all of us in who work in the health care system can 
bear this in mind in our everyday work.
