Quantum dots (QDs) are used for imaging and transport of therapeutics. Here we 
demonstrate rapid absorption across the small intestine and targeted delivery of 
QDs with bound materials to the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) or 
hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo following oral administration. QDs were 
radiolabeled with 3H-oleic acid, with a fluorescent tag or 14C-metformin placed 
within a drug binding site. Three different biopolymer shell coatings were 
compared (formaldehyde-treated serum albumin (FSA), gelatin, heparin). Passage 
across the small intestine into mesenteric veins is mediated by clathrin 
endocytosis and micropinocytosis. 60% of an oral dose of QDs was rapidly 
distributed to the liver within 30 min, and this increased to 85% with FSA 
biopolymer coating. Uptake into LSECs also increased 3-fold with FSA coating, 
while uptake into hepatocytes was increased from 40% to 85% with gelatin 
biopolymer coating. Localization of QDs to LSECs was confirmed with 
immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. 85% of QDs were cleared 
within 24 h of administration. The bioavailability of 14C-metformin 2 h 
post-ingestion was increased 5-fold by conjugation with QD-FSA, while uptake of 
metformin into LSECs was improved 50-fold by using these QDs. Endocytosis of QDs 
by SK-Hep1 cells (an LSEC immortal cell line) was via clathrin- and 
caveolae-mediated pathways with QDs taken up into lysosomes. In conclusion, we 
have shown high specificity targeting of the LSEC or hepatocytes after oral 
administration of QDs coated with a biopolymer layer of FSA or gelatin, which 
improved the bioavailability and delivery of metformin to LSECs.
