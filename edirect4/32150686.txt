Over the past 66 years, our knowledge of the role of the endothelium in the 
regulation of cardiovascular function and dysfunction has advanced from the 
assumption that it is a single layer of cells that serves as a barrier between 
the blood stream and vascular smooth muscle to an understanding of its role as 
an essential endocrine-like organ. In terms of historical contributions, we pay 
particular credit to (1) the Canadian scientist Dr. Rudolf Altschul who, based 
on pathological changes in the appearance of the endothelium, advanced the 
argument in 1954 that "one is only as old as one's endothelium" and (2) the 
American scientist Dr. Robert Furchgott, a 1998 Nobel Prize winner in Physiology 
or Medicine, who identified the importance of the endothelium in the regulation 
of blood flow. This review provides a brief history of how our knowledge of 
endothelial function has advanced and now recognize that the endothelium 
produces a plethora of signaling molecules possessing paracrine, autocrine, and, 
arguably, systemic hormone functions. In addition, the endothelium is a 
therapeutic target for the anti-diabetic drugs metformin, glucagon-like peptide 
I (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and inhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 
2 (SGLT2) that offset the vascular disease associated with diabetes.
