BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggested that the use of metformin had more 
benefits for both prevention and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) than 
non-metformin use in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM); however, it remains 
to be fully elucidated on this topic. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of published studies to determine the association between 
metformin use and TB in patients with diabetes.
METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Information Sciences Institute (ISI) Web of 
Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were searched from their inception to 15 
April 2019. Studies that evaluated the use of metformin and TB disease were 
included. The quality of each study was evaluated through the Newcastle-Ottawa 
Scale (NOS). For pooled data, the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated; otherwise, a systematic review.
RESULTS: Seventeen observational studies were included, all of which indicated a 
low risk of bias according to the NOS. The pooled analysis showed that metformin 
use was associated with a significantly lower active TB incidence and mortality 
among individuals with DM (RR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.69, P ⩽ 0.001) and with 
TB-DM (RR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20-0.57, P ⩽ 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicated metformin use is related to benefits 
in both prevention and treatment outcomes of tuberculosis among patients with 
diabetes. Prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm these associations.
