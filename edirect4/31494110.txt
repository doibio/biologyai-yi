Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel class of 
medications that reduce plasma glucose concentrations through an 
insulin-independent mechanism of increased urinary glucose excretion, with 
concomitant natriuresis and diuresis. Clinical outcomes trials with SGLT2 
inhibitors revealed a cardioprotective benefit among patients with diabetes 
mellitus, with a consistent reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. As 
such, the 2018 updated US and European treatment guidelines for diabetes 
mellitus incorporated SGLT2 inhibitors as second-line glucose-lowering agents 
after metformin. Although well tolerated, there are known adverse effects with 
SGLT2 inhibitors that require clinical monitoring, such as genital mycotic 
infections, diabetic ketoacidosis, volume depletion particularly in the setting 
of concomitant diuretic use, and lower limb amputations with canagliflozin. 
Ongoing clinical trials will uncover the potential benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors 
in patients with prevalent heart failure with or without diabetes mellitus.
