The antidiabetic drug metformin displays anticancer properties in several 
neoplasms. In pituitary NETs, aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein 
(AIP) is up-regulated by the somatostatin analog octreotide. Metformin inhibited 
QGP-1 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, at concentrations 
similar to those achievable in treated patients (-31 ± 12%, p < 0.05 vs basal at 
100 μM). Moreover, metformin decreased pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors 
(PAN-NETs) cell proliferation (-62 ± 15%, p < 0.0001 vs basal at 10 mM), without 
any additive effect when combined with octreotide. Both octreotide and metformin 
induced AIP up-regulation. AIP silencing abolished the reduction of mTOR 
phosphorylation induced by metformin and octreotide. Moreover, metformin 
decreased HSP70, increased Zac1 and AhR expression; these effects were abolished 
in AIP silenced QGP-1 cells. In conclusion, metformin acts as an anticancer 
agent in PAN-NET cells, its activity is mediated by AIP and its interacting 
proteins. These findings provide a novel insight into the antitumorigenic 
mechanism of metformin.
