Data from well-conducted studies indicate that metformin levels in milk are low 
and infants would receive less than 0.5% of their mother's weight-adjusted 
dosage. Milk metformin levels are relatively constant during maternal metformin 
use, so timing of breastfeeding with respect to the administration times is of 
little benefit. Although the dose in milk is low, metformin is sometimes 
detectable in low levels in the serum of breastfed infants. One sizeable 
prospective study found no adverse effects in breastfed infants. Metformin is 
sometimes used as a galactogogue in women with reduced milk supply, but there is 
no evidence that it is effective. Metformin should be used with caution while 
nursing newborn and premature infants and those with renal impairment.
