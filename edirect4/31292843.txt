A 60-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital for further 
examination of persistent liver dysfunction. She had been suffering from type 2 
diabetes mellitus since the age of 50 years. Her hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value 
was as high as 7.8% despite treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, 
metformin, and sulfonylurea. After excluding viral hepatitis, alcohol or 
drug-induced liver injury, and autoimmune liver diseases, liver histology 
evidence of macrovesicular steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and pericellular 
fibrosis confirmed a diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). 
Luseogliflozin (2.5 mg/day), a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor 
(SGLT2I), was co-administered to strengthen glycemic control. Liver enzymes and 
HbA1c gradually improved without any adverse events. A second liver biopsy at 
15 months after luseogliflozin commencement revealed improvements in steatosis, 
fibrosis, and overall histological activity score. This case demonstrates that 
long-term luseogliflozin may be a good therapeutic option for diabetic 
NAFLD/NASH patients. The merits of persistent SGLT2I administration for 
NAFLD/NASH patients warrant validation in future studies.
