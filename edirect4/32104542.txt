Senescence of renal tubular epithelial cells plays an important role in diabetic 
nephropathy, but the mechanism is unknown. Metformin may alleviate diabetic 
nephropathy by reducing this senescence. This study is aimed at clarifying the 
effects and mechanism of metformin on the senescence of renal tubular epithelial 
cells in diabetic nephropathy. We found that metformin reduced the expression of 
senescence-associated gene P21 in high-glucose-induced (30 mmol/L) renal tubular 
epithelial cells and decreased the β-galactosidase positive staining rate 
(decreased 16%, p < 0.01). Metformin was able to reduce senescence by 
upregulating the expression of RNA-binding protein MBNL1 and miR-130a-3p and 
reducing STAT3 expression. MBNL1 prolonged the half-life of miR-130a-3p, and 
miR-130a-3p could negatively regulate STAT3 by binding to its mRNA 3'UTR. In 
db/db diabetic mice, we found an enhanced senescence level combined with low 
expression of MBNL1 and miR-130a-3p and high expression of STAT3 compared with 
db/m control mice during nephropathy development. Meanwhile, metformin 
(200 mg/kg/day) could increase the expression of MBNL1 and miR-130a-3p and 
decreased STAT3 expression, thus reducing this senescence in db/db mice. Our 
results suggest that metformin reduces the senescence of renal tubular 
epithelial cells in diabetic nephropathy via the MBNL1/miR-130a-3p/STAT3 
pathway, which provided new ideas for the therapy of this disease.
