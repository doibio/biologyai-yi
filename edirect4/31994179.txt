BACKGROUND: The use of gonadotrophins as a first-line treatment for anovulatory 
infertility has been limited by a perception of a risk of multi-fetal gestation 
and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). However, it has recently been 
recognised as an acceptable first-line treatment if appropriate monitoring is 
performed.
AIMS: To determine the cumulative live birth rate, incidence of multiple 
gestation, cycle cancellation rate and incidence of OHSS for therapy-naïve 
anovulatory women undergoing ovulation induction with gonadotrophins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study of 258 patients 
undergoing ovulation induction with a 'low-dose step-up' protocol was performed 
over a three-year period across two fertility centres (40% of patients were 
currently or recently prescribed metformin).
RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of patients required concurrent use of luteinising 
hormone. The cumulative pregnancy and live birth rates were 22.5% and 18.2%, 
40.3% and 34.5%, 47.7% and 41.1% after completion of the first, second and third 
cycles of stimulation, respectively, with a median duration of stimulation of 
15 days. No patients developed OHSS and 10.5% of cycles were cancelled due to an 
excessive or no follicular response. The multiple pregnancy rate was 2%. The 
cumulative pregnancy rate was reduced for women over 35 years of age (23.8 vs 
55.3%, P = 0.006) and for women with a body mass index greater than 25 kg/m2 
(40.6 vs 56.7%, P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that ovulation 
induction with gonadotrophin therapy, in the context of appropriate monitoring, 
is a safe and effective treatment for young therapy-naïve patients with 
anovulatory infertility.
