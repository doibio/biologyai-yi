BACKGROUND: Identifying colorectal cancer associated risks is important for 
conducting a program for the survey and prevention of colorectal cancer.
AIM: To investigate the association between use of insulin or metformin with 
colorectal cancer (CRC) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study.
METHODS: Through analysis of National Health Insurance (NHI) database between 
1998 and 2010 in Taiwan, we identified 66 324 T2DM patients aged ≥ 20 years and 
selected subjects without diabetes by 1: 1 randomly matching with the study 
cohort based on age, sex and index date. We followed up the participants until 
31 December 2011 or when they withdrew from the NHI program.
RESULTS: Compared with non-diabetic subjects, the T2DM patients exhibited an 
increased risk of CRC [adjusted HR (aHR) = 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 
1.39-1.75], after adjustment for age, sex, urbanization level, comorbidities and 
examinations of colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or stool occult blood test. Among 
the T2DM patients, insulin usage increased the risk of CRC (aHR = 1.86, 95% 
CI = 1.58-0-2.19) after adjustment for age, sex, urbanization level, 
comorbidities, metformin usage and examinations; nevertheless, metformin 
decreased the risk of CRC (aHR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.54-0.77) after adjustment for 
age, sex, urbanization level, comorbidities, insulin usage and examinations. 
Compared with the non-insulin cohort, the risk of CRC tended to increase with 
the incremental dosage of insulin exposure.
CONCLUSION: Our population-based cohort study demonstrated an association 
between T2DM and CRC. Among the T2DM patients, insulin use was associated with 
an increased risk of CRC and metformin use was associated with a decreased risk 
of CRC. Inability to obtain information on several potential confounding 
factors, such as lifestyle and dietary habits, is the major limitation of the 
study.
