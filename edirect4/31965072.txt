BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diabetic subjects are at increased risk of subtle 
cognitive impairment since the disease early stages and of dementia later in 
life. In animal models, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonizts (GLP1-RAs) 
have been shown to exert neuroprotective effects, expecially in the memory 
domain. We assessed whether treatment with a GLP1-RA might affect cognitive 
functions in type 2 diabetic subjects independently on the weight loss it might 
induce.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Forty metformin-treated obese subjects with prediabetes or 
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus, received liraglutide (1.8 mg/d) 
(n = 20) or lifestyle counseling (dietary intervention and exercise training) 
(n = 20) until achieving a modest and comparable weight loss (-7% of initial 
body weight).
INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: A detailed neuropsychological assessment before and after 
weight loss was completed in 16 patients per arm, who were administered a total 
of seven psychological tests, thus assessing three composite domain z-scores for 
attention, memory, and executive control.
RESULTS: After comparable weight loss and superimposable glycemic control and 
insulin sensitivity, a significant increase in short term memory (mean Digit 
Span Z score from -0.06 to 0.80, p = 0.024) and memory composite z-score (mean 
memory z-score from -0.67 to 0.032, p = 0.0065) was observed in the liraglutide 
exposed subjects (between group p = 0.041 and p = 0.033, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide might slow down memory function decline in diabetic 
patients in early, and possibly preclinical stages of the disease.
