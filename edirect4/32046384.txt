Metformin (MET) is increasingly implicated in reducing the incidence of multiple 
cancer types in patients with diabetes. However, similar effects of MET in 
non-diabetic women with endometrial cancer (EC) remain unknown. In a pilot 
study, obese non-diabetic women diagnosed with type 1, grade 1/2 EC, and 
consenting to participate were randomly assigned to receive MET or no MET 
(control (CON)) during the pre-surgical window between diagnosis and 
hysterectomy. Endometrial tumors obtained at surgery (MET, n = 4; CON, n = 4) 
were analyzed for proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (TUNEL), and nuclear 
expression of ERα, PGR, PTEN, and KLF9 proteins in tumor glandular epithelial 
(GE) and stromal (ST) cells. The percentages of immunopositive cells for PGR and 
for KLF9 in GE and for PTEN in ST were higher while those for ERα in GE but not 
ST were lower, in tumors of MET vs. CON patients. The numbers of Ki67- and 
TUNEL-positive cells in tumor GE and ST did not differ between groups. In human 
Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells, MET treatment (60 μM) decreased cell numbers 
and elicited distinct temporal changes in ESR1, KLF9, PGR, PGR-B, KLF4, DKK1, 
and other tumor biomarker mRNA levels. In the context of reduced KLF9 expression 
(by siRNA targeting), MET rapidly amplified PGR, PGR-B, and KLF4 transcript 
levels. Our findings suggest that MET acts directly in EC cells to modify 
steroid receptor expression and signaling network and may constitute a 
preventative strategy against EC in high-risk non-diabetic women.
