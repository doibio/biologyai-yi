PURPOSE: The aim of present study was to analyze the effect of alpha-mangostin 
on cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and biochemical parameters in 
high-fat/high-glucose diet and low-dose streptozotocin injection 
(HF/HG/STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic rats.
METHODS: Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by giving a combination of 
high-fat/high-glucose (HF/HG) diet for 3 weeks and followed by low-dose 
streptozotocin intraperitoneal injection (STZ; 35 mg/kg) at Week-3 and the HF/HG 
diet was continued until 8 weeks. The diabetic rats were then divided into four 
groups (each, n=6): untreated diabetic group (HF/HG/STZ); diabetic group treated 
with metformin 200 mg/kg/day (HF/HG/STZ+Metformin); diabetic group treated with 
alpha-mangostin 100 mg/kg/day (HF/HG/STZ+AM100); and diabetic group treated with 
alpha-mangostin 200 mg/kg/day (HF/HG/STZ+AM200) and all were given by oral 
gavage for 8 weeks. We also included a control group (C) treated with AM200 
(C+AM200). The role of alpha-mangostin was assessed through its effect on blood 
glucose levels, HOMA-IR, blood pressure, body weight, pro-inflammatory cytokines 
in cardiac tissue, serum aminotransferases (ALT and AST), lipid profiles 
(cholesterol and triglyceride), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid, cardiac 
hypertrophy and fibrosis.
RESULTS: Diabetic rats treated with alpha-mangostin in both doses for 8 weeks 
showed decrease in blood glucose levels, HOMA-IR, and blood pressure. 
Alpha-mangostin treatment also prevented HF/HG/STZ-induced changes in the 
activities of ALT, AST, BUN, uric acid, lipid profiles, and pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, which were comparable with the standard drug metformin, while 
alpha-mangostin did not show any significant effects on control rats (p>0.05). 
The cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were also attenuated in diabetic rats 
treated with alpha-mangostin in both doses.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that administration of alpha-mangostin can 
effectively attenuate diabetes-induced alteration in cardiac hypertrophy and 
fibrosis as well as biochemical parameters in HF/HG/STZ rats.
