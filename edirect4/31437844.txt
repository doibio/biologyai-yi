BACKGROUND: Metformin ameliorates non-histamine-mediated itch. We have recently 
reported that the nitric oxide (NO) pathway is involved in chloroquine 
(CQ)-induced scratching behavior. Here we investigated the involvement of the NO 
pathway in the antipruritic effect of metformin on CQ-induced itch.
METHODS: Metformin (5-200 mg/kg, given intraperitoneally [i.p.]) was injected 4 
h before CQ (400 µg/site, given intradermally [i.d.]) or compound 48/80 (100 
µg/site, i.d.). A nonspecific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, 
NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 1 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.), or an NO 
precursor, L-arginine (10 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30 min before 
injection of CQ. A neural NOS (nNOS) inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 1 and 10 
nmol/site, i.d.) was concurrently administered with CQ. The scratching behavior 
was recorded for 30 min following the injection of CQ. We studied the changes in 
skin and spinal nitrite levels after treatments.
RESULTS: Our results showed that metformin (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly 
reduced the CQ-induced scratching behavior but not the compound 48/80-induced 
scratching behavior. L-Arginine inhibited the antipruritic effect of metformin, 
while L-NAME and 7-NI significantly potentiated the inhibitory effects of a 
subeffective dose of metformin on the CQ-induced scratching behavior. The skin 
but not the spinal nitrite level was significantly increased after CQ 
administration. The elevated cutaneous nitrite level was reversed by effective 
doses of either metformin or 7-NI, but not by the subeffective doses of 
metformin + 7-NI.
CONCLUSION: Acute injection of metformin significantly inhibits CQ-induced 
scratching behavior. This effect is mediated through inhibition of the NO 
pathway, especially by inhibiting the dermal nNOS enzyme.
