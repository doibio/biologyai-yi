PURPOSE: Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in developed 
countries. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to 
investigate the effect of metformin on biomarkers associated with breast cancer 
outcomes and to explore the dose-response relationship.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed from onset of the database to January 
2019 in MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane library to identify randomized 
clinical trials investigating the impact of metformin on insulin, glucose, CRP, 
leptin, body mass indices (BMI), cholesterol, Ki-67, and Homeostatic Model 
Assessment for Insulin-Resistance (HOMA-IR). Effect sizes were expressed as 
weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a 
random-effects models.
RESULTS: Nine studies providing 1,363 participants were included in the 
meta-analysis. Pooled results showed a significant reduction in insulin (WMD: 
- 0.99 U/ml, 95% CI - 1.66, - 0.33), glucose (WMD: - 1.78 ml/dl, 95% CI - 2.96, 
- 0.60), CRP (WMD: - 0.60 mg/l, 95% CI - 0.88, - 0.33), HOMA-IR (WMD: - 0.45, 
95% CI - 0.77, - 0.11), leptin (WMD: - 2.44 ng/ml, 95% CI - 3.28, - 1.61), BMI 
(WMD: - 0.55 kg/m2, 95% CI - 1.00, - 0.11), and Ki-67 (WMD: - 4.06, 95% CI 
- 7.59, - 0.54). Results of the subgroup analyses showed that insulin, glucose, 
and BMI decreased more significantly when the duration of administering 
metformin intervention was above 4 weeks. We did not observe non-linear changes 
in the dose-response relationship between metformin and biomarkers as outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients receiving metformin as treatment for 
diabetes showed significant reduction in levels of insulin, fasting glucose, 
CRP, HOMA, leptin, BMI, and Ki-67.
