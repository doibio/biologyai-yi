OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety of metformin vs sulfonylureas in patients with 
type 2 diabetes by chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adults in 
Manitoba, Canada, with type 2 diabetes, an incident monotherapy prescription for 
metformin or a sulfonylurea, and a serum creatinine measurement from April 1, 
2006, to March 31, 2017. Patients were stratified by estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) into the following groups: eGFR of 90 or greater, 60 to 
89, 45 to 59, 30 to 44, or less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Outcomes included 
all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and major hypoglycemic episodes. 
Baseline characteristics were used to calculate propensity scores and perform 
inverse probability of treatment weights analysis, and eGFR group was examined 
as an effect modifier for each outcome.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 21,996 individuals (19,990 metformin users and 
2006 sulfonylurea users). Metformin use was associated with lower risk for 
all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40-0.58; P<.001), 
cardiovascular events (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.86; P=.002), and major 
hypoglycemic episodes (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.09-0.20; P<.001) when compared with 
sulfonylureas. CKD was a significant effect modifier for all-cause mortality 
(P=.002), but not for cardiovascular events or major hypoglycemic episodes.
CONCLUSION: Sulfonylurea monotherapy is associated with higher risk for 
all-cause mortality, major hypoglycemic episodes, and cardiovascular events 
compared with metformin. Although the presence of CKD attenuated the mortality 
benefit, metformin may be a safer alternative to sulfonylureas in patients with 
CKD.
