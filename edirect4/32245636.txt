Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) are one of the most widely used 
antihyperglycemic therapeutic classes in type 2 diabetes mellitus management. In 
April 2016 and August 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced 
sequential labelling requirements regarding heart failure risk related to 
DPP-4i. We explored longitudinal trends in prescription of DPP-4i before and 
after these FDA warnings in a multicenter health system. We identified all 
first-time prescriptions of DPP4i or their combinations across the Partners 
HealthCare system (Boston, MA) from October 2006 (FDA approval of first DPP-4i) 
to December 2018. Overall, 11,830 patients were newly prescribed DPP-4i during 
the study period. Primary care physicians (31.5%) were the most common 
prescribing specialty. Overall, 8.4%, 20.4%, and 11.6% had heart failure, 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, 
respectively. Median number of background antihyperglycemic therapies was 2 
[25th to 75th percentiles 1 to 2], commonly metformin (65.4%) and/or insulin 
(36.4%). The vast majority of prescriptions were sitagliptin (85.7%), followed 
by linagliptin (9.5%), saxagliptin (4.7%), and alogliptin (0.2%). Quarterly 
prescriptions rose gradually from 2006 to mid-2016, and have decreased 
consistently since then for each of the 4 DPP-4i. Declines in DPP-4i among 
high-risk groups and those initiated by endocrinologists were most pronounced. 
In conclusion, although DPP-4i remain a dominant oral antihyperglycemic therapy 
in clinical practice, new prescriptions have declined recently. These data may 
reflect relatively swift health system response to broad FDA safety 
communications regarding heart failure risk, which appeared to impact the entire 
DPP-4i class, including specific drugs that have not demonstrated any increased 
risk of heart failure.
