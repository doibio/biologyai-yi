Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2 or CASPR2) is a neuronal 
transmembrane protein of the neurexin superfamily that is involved in many 
neurological diseases, such as autism and pain hypersensitivity. We recently 
found that Cntnap2-/- mice showed elevated Akt-mTOR activity in the brain, and 
suppression of the Akt-mTOR pathway rescued the social deficit in Cntnap2-/- 
mice. In this study, we found that the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) from 
Cntnap2-/- mice also showed hyperactive Akt-mTOR signaling. Treatment with the 
Akt inhibitor LY94002 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin attenuated pain-related 
hypersensitivity to noxious mechanical stimuli, heat, and inflammatory 
substances. Further, suppression of mTOR signaling by rapamycin decreased DRG 
neuronal hyperexcitability. We further indicated that treatment with the 
FDA-approved drug metformin normalized the hyperactive Akt-mTOR signaling, and 
attenuated pain-related hypersensitivity in Cntnap2-/- mice. Our results thus 
identified hyperactive Akt-mTOR signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic 
target for pain-related hypersensitivity in patients with dysfunction of 
CNTNAP2.
