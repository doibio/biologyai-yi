BACKGROUND: The FDA approved 'label' for metformin lists hepatic insufficiency 
as a risk for lactic acidosis. Little evidence supports this warning.
AIMS: To investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of metformin in patients 
with chronic liver disease (CLD).
METHODS: Chronic liver disease patients with and without type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) were studied by a cross-sectional survey of patients already 
prescribed metformin (n = 34), and by a prospective study where metformin 
(500 mg, immediate release, twice daily) for up to 6 weeks was prescribed 
(n = 24). Plasma metformin and lactate concentrations were monitored. Individual 
pharmacokinetics were obtained and compared to previously published values from 
healthy and T2DM populations without CLD.
RESULTS: All plasma metformin and lactate concentrations remained below the 
putative safety thresholds (metformin, 5 mg/L; lactate, 5 mmol/L). Lactate 
concentrations were unrelated to average steady-state metformin concentrations. 
In patients with CLD, T2DM was associated with higher plasma lactate 
concentrations (48% higher than those without T2DM, P < 0.0001). CLD patients 
with cirrhosis had 23% higher lactate concentrations than those without 
cirrhosis (P = 0.01). The pharmacokinetics of metformin in CLD patients were 
similar to patients with T2DM and no liver disease. The ratio of apparent 
metformin clearance (CLMet /F) to creatinine clearance was marginally lower in 
CLD patients compared to healthy subjects (median, interquartile range; 12.6, 
9.5-15.9 vs 14.9, 13.4-16.4; P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of metformin are not altered sufficiently in 
CLD patients to raise concerns regarding unsafe concentrations of metformin. 
There were no unsafe plasma lactate concentrations observed in CLD patients 
receiving metformin (ACTRN12619001292167; ACTRN12619001348145).
