OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of an initial triple therapy using 
metformin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, and thiazolidinedione with 
a stepwise approach using sulfonylurea and metformin in new-onset, drug-naïve 
patients with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Among drug-naïve patients with 9.0%-12.0% glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) but no hyperglycemic symptoms, 100 subjects who started 
triple medications (metformin 1000 mg/day, sitagliptin 100 mg/day, and 
lobeglitazone 0.5 mg/day) were selected as an initial triple therapy group. Age 
and body mass index-matched subjects (n=100) who started glimepiride (≥2 mg/day 
with uptitration) and metformin (≥1000 mg/day with uptitration) were selected as 
a conventional therapy group. We investigated changes in HbA1c level, dynamic 
indexes for insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, and hypoglycemia.
RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment, HbA1c levels decreased significantly in 
both groups: from 10.7%±1.0% to 6.7%±1.3% in the triple group, and from 
10.5%±1.0% to 7.3%±1.2% in the conventional therapy group. At 12 months, 
achievement of the HbA1c target (<7.0%) was higher in the triple group than in 
the conventional group (70% vs 52%, p<0.01). Dynamic indexes related to β-cell 
function and insulin sensitivity improved, and albuminuria reduced significantly 
only in the triple group. Hypoglycemia was more common in the conventional 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Initial triple combination therapy with the DPP4 inhibitor, 
metformin, and thiazolidinedione showed a higher achievement of the target HbA1c 
goal with a lower risk of hypoglycemia, better restoration of β-cell function, 
and multiple metabolic benefits, implying durable glycemic control. This 
strategy may be useful for patients presenting with type 2 diabetes and high 
HbA1c levels.
