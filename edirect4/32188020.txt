Both rosiglitazone and metformin have effects on blood glucose regulation and 
the proliferation of liver cancer cells. Combination therapy with these two 
drugs is common and effective for the treatment of diabetes in the clinic, 
however, the application of these two drugs is influenced by the poor 
dissolution of rosiglitazone and the gastrointestinal side-effect of metformin 
resulting from a high solubility. The formation of a multidrug crystal form 
(Rsg-Met) by a solvent evaporation method can solve the solubility issue. 
Crystal structure data and intramolecular hydrogen bonds were detected by X-ray 
diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. Surprisingly, Rsg-Met shortens the time 
spent in solubility equilibrium and multiplies the dissolution rate of Rsg. 
Finally, we found that a low concentration of Rsg-Met enhanced the proliferation 
inhibition effect on liver cancer cells (HepG2, SK-hep1) compared with 
rosiglitazone, without affecting the human normal cell line LO2.
