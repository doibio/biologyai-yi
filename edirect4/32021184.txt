PURPOSE: Chemotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has many 
systemic side effects, as well as hypoxia-induced chemoresistance. To reduce 
side effects and enhance chemosensitivity are urgently needed.
METHODS: We synthesized a drug delivery system (named CECMa NPs) based on 
cisplatin (CDDP) and metformin (chemotherapeutic sensitizer), of which chlorin 
e6 (Ce6) and polyethylene glycol diamine (PEG) were synthesized as the shell, an 
anti-LDLR antibody (which can target to hypoxic tumor cells) was modified on the 
surface to achieve tumor targeting.
RESULTS: The NPs possessed a great synergistic effect of chemotherapy and 
phototherapy. After laser stimulation, both CDDP and metformin can be released 
in situ to achieve anti-tumor effects. Meanwhile, PDT and PTT triggered by a 
laser have anticancer effects. Furthermore, compared with free cisplatin, CECMa 
exhibits less systemic toxicity with laser irradiation in the xenograft mouse 
tumor model.
CONCLUSION: CECMa effectively destroyed the tumors via hypoxia targeting 
multimodal therapy both in vitro and in vivo, thereby providing a novel strategy 
for targeting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
