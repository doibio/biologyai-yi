BACKGROUND: Early pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DMCM) may involve 
lipotoxicity of cardiomyocytes in the context of hyperglycemia. There are many 
preclinical studies of DMCM pathogenesis, but the human evidence is still poorly 
understood.
OBJECTIVES: By using a nondiabetic mellitus (non-DM) heart transplanted (HTX) in 
diabetes mellitus (DM) recipients, this study conducted a serial study of human 
heart transplant recipients evaluating cardiac effects of diabetic milieu 
(hyperglycemia and insulin resistance) on lipotoxic-mediated injury. We 
evaluated cardiomyocyte morpho-pathology by seriated biopsies of healthy 
implanted hearts in DM recipients during 12-month follow-up from HTX. Because 
metformin reduces ectopic lipid accumulation, we evaluated the effects of the 
drug in a nonrandomized subgroup.
METHODS: The DMCM-AHEAD (Diabetes and Lipid Accumulation and Heart Transplant) 
prospective ongoing study (NCT03546062) evaluated 158 first HTX recipients (82 
non-DM, 76 DM of whom 35 [46%] were receiving metformin). HTX recipients were 
undergoing clinical standard evaluation (metabolic status, echocardiography, 
coronary computed tomography angiography, and endomyocardial biopsies). Biopsies 
evaluated immune response, Oil Red-O staining, ceramide, and triacylglycerol 
levels. Lipotoxic factors and insulin resistance were evaluated by reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: There was a significant early and progressive cardiomyocyte lipid 
accumulation in DM but not in non-DM recipients (p = 0.019). In the subgroup 
receiving metformin, independently from immunosuppressive therapy that was 
similar among groups, lipid accumulation was reduced in comparison with DM 
recipients not receiving the drug (hazard ratio: 6.597; 95% confidence interval: 
2.516 to 17.296; p < 0.001). Accordingly, lipotoxic factors were increased in DM 
versus non-DM recipients, and, relevantly, metformin use was associated with 
fewer lipotoxic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Early pathogenesis of human DMCM started with cardiomyocyte lipid 
accumulation following HTX in DM recipients. Metformin use was associated with 
reduced lipid accumulation independently of immunosuppressive therapy. This may 
constitute a novel target for therapy of DMCM.
