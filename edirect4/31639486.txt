ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaves have been widely 
applied to controlling blood glucose as a efficacious traditional Chinese 
medicine or salutary medical supplement. The extracts of mulberry leaf suppress 
inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress, protect the pancreatic β-cells and 
modulate glucose metabolism in diabetic rats. Our previous studies and others 
have shown that mulberry leaf extract has excellent therapeutic effects on type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), however, the underlying mechanism remains to be 
studied.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Skeletal muscle insulin resistance (IR) plays an important 
role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
effects and mechanisms of Mulberry leaf flavonoids (MLF) in L6 skeletal muscle 
cells and db/db mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: L6 skeletal muscle cells were cultured and treated 
with/without MLF for in vitro studies. For in vivo studies, the db/db mice 
with/without MLF therapy were used. Coomassie brilliant blue staining and α-SMA 
immunofluorescence staining were used to identify the differentiated L6 cells. 
Glucose level and ATP level of L6 myotubes were performed by optical density 
detection and cell viability was performed by MTT method. Mitochondrial membrane 
potential of L6 myotubes was detected by JC-1 fluorescent staining. ROS level of 
L6 myotubes was detected by DCFH-DA fluorescent staining. The body weight, food 
intake, and blood glucose of the mice were measured in different treatment days. 
Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), starch glucose tolerance test (STT) and 
insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed in mice. Glycated hemoglobin, 
glycated serum protein, insulin, liver and muscle glycogen, total cholesterol 
(TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) of the mice were detected by 
corresponding kit. The pathologic change of pancreas and skeletal muscle of mice 
were performed by H & E staining. Immunohistochemistry staining was used to 
detect the GLUT4 and p-AMPK expressions in skeletal muscle in mice. GLUT4, 
CPT-1, NRF1, COXIV, PGC-1α, and p-AMPK expression levels in L6 cells and mice 
were detected by western bolt assay.
RESULTS: MLF and metformin significantly ameliorated muscle glucose uptake and 
mitochondrial function in L6 muscle cells. MLF also increased the 
phosphorylation of AMPK and the expression of PGC-1α, and up-regulated the 
protein levels of m-GLUT4 and T-GLUT4. These effects were reversed by the AMPK 
inhibitor compound C. In db/db mice, MLF improve diabetes symptoms and insulin 
resistance. Moreover, MLF elevated the levels of p-AMPK and PGC-1α, raised 
m-GLUT4 and T-GLUT4 protein expression, and ameliorated mitochondrial function 
in skeletal muscle of db/db mice.
CONCLUSIONS: MLF significantly improved skeletal muscle insulin resistance and 
mitochondrial function in db/db mice and L6 myocytes through AMPK-PGC-1α 
signaling pathway, and our findings support the therapeutic effects of MLF on 
type 2 diabetes.
