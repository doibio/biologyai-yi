Cardiovascular and renal outcome trials demonstrate nephroprotection with 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes. 
Attenuation of hyperfiltration is believed to be responsible for the 
nephroprotection, and studies in young adults with type 1 diabetes suggest that 
afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction induced by a tubuloglomerular feedback 
mechanism may be responsible for this effect. The study by van Bommel et al. 
suggests that this mechanism may not hold true in older adults with type 2 
diabetes, who instead attenuate elevated glomerular filtration rate via 
post-glomerular vasodilation.
