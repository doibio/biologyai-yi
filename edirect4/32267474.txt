IMPORTANCE: Adults with comorbidity have less physiological reserve and an 
increased rate of postoperative mortality and readmission after the stress of a 
major surgical intervention.
OBJECTIVE: To assess postoperative mortality and readmission among individuals 
with diabetes with or without preoperative prescriptions for metformin.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study obtained data from the 
electronic health record of a multicenter, single health care system in 
Pennsylvania. Included were adults with diabetes who underwent a major operation 
with hospital admission from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2016, at 15 
community and academic hospitals within the system. Individuals without a 
clinical indication for metformin therapy were excluded. Follow-up continued 
until December 18, 2018.
EXPOSURES: Preoperative metformin exposure was defined as 1 or more 
prescriptions for metformin in the 180 days before the surgical procedure.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause postoperative mortality, hospital 
readmission within 90 days of discharge, and preoperative inflammation measured 
by the neutrophil to leukocyte ratio were compared between those with and 
without preoperative prescriptions for metformin. The corresponding absolute 
risk reduction (ARR) and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI were calculated 
in a propensity score-matched cohort.
RESULTS: Among the 10 088 individuals with diabetes who underwent a major 
surgical intervention, 5962 (59%) had preoperative metformin prescriptions. A 
total of 5460 patients were propensity score-matched, among whom the mean (SD) 
age was 67.7 (12.2) years, and 2866 (53%) were women. In the propensity 
score-matched cohort, preoperative metformin prescriptions were associated with 
a reduced hazard for 90-day mortality (adjusted HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.55-0.95]; 
ARR, 1.28% [95% CI, 0.26-2.31]) and hazard of readmission, with mortality as a 
competing risk at both 30 days (ARR, 2.09% [95% CI, 0.35-3.82]; sub-HR, 0.84 
[95% CI, 0.72-0.98]) and 90 days (ARR, 2.78% [95% CI, 0.62-4.95]; sub-HR, 0.86 
[95% CI, 0.77-0.97]). Preoperative inflammation was reduced in those with 
metformin prescriptions compared with those without (mean neutrophil to 
leukocyte ratio, 4.5 [95% CI, 4.3-4.6] vs 5.0 [95% CI, 4.8-5.3]; P < .001). 
E-value analysis suggested robustness to unmeasured confounding.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found an association between metformin 
prescriptions provided to individuals with type 2 diabetes before a major 
surgical procedure and reduced risk-adjusted mortality and readmission after the 
operation. This association warrants further investigation.
