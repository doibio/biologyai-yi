OBJECTIVES: The DISCOVER study is a global, prospective, three- year- 
observational (non-interventional) study that was conducted in 37 countries 
throughout the world including Saudi Arabia and aimed to assess variations in 
treatment patterns and therapeutic outcomes in type 2 diabetic patients. The 
current manuscript is reporting data of DISCOVER study across different health 
sectors of various provinces in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: In this study, 519 Saudi type 2 diabetics, non-insulin users, aged 
18 years or older, initiating second line therapy, were selected from nine 
health institutes, in four out of five provinces in Saudi Arabia. Data was 
collected at baseline (initiation of 2nd line therapy) by the treating physician 
using an electronic case report form (eCRF) via a web-based data capture system. 
Each selected subject was asked to complete four self-administered 
questionnaires.
RESULTS: The mean age of the studied population was 52.4 ± 11 years. Among the 
subjects selected from the nine medical centers, 55% were men, with almost 65% 
between the ages of 46 and 65 years. The oral agent used as 1st line in the 
majority of patients was metformin, prescribed in 89.2% of the study cohort. In 
the second line, sitagliptin was the most frequently used, at 61.8%. followed by 
gliclazide, glibenclamide, and glimepiride at 35.6%, 13.1%, and 12.7%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Metformin, with or without sulfonylureas, is the most commonly 
prescribed first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes, managed 
either in governmental institutions, or in the private sector. The most common 
second line drugs were DPP4 inhibitors, mainly sitagliptin, followed by the 
third and second generation of sulfonylureas. Drug affordability was not an 
issue, since the vast majority of the patients received medication free of 
charge.
