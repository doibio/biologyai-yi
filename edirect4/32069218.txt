CONTEXT: Altered tissue-specific glucocorticoid metabolism has been described in 
uncomplicated obesity and type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that weight loss 
induced by diet and exercise, which has previously been shown to reverse 
abnormal cortisol metabolism in uncomplicated obesity, also normalizes cortisol 
metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: Test the effects of a diet intervention with added exercise on 
glucocorticoid metabolism.
DESIGN: Two groups followed a Paleolithic diet (PD) for 12 weeks with added 180 
min of structured aerobic and resistance exercise per week in one randomized 
group (PDEX).
SETTING: Umeå University Hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Men and women with type 2 diabetes treated with lifestyle 
modification ± metformin were included. Twenty-eight participants (PD, n = 15; 
PDEX, n = 13) completed measurements of glucocorticoid metabolism.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in glucocorticoid metabolite levels in 24-h urine 
samples, expression of HSD11B1 mRNA in s.c. adipose tissue and conversion of 
orally administered cortisone to cortisol measured in plasma. Body composition 
and insulin sensitivity were measured using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, 
and liver fat was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
RESULTS: Both groups lost weight and improved insulin sensitivity. Conversion of 
orally taken cortisone to plasma cortisol and the ratio of 5α-THF + 5β-THF/THE 
in urine increased in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These interventions caused weight loss and improved insulin 
sensitivity with concomitant increases in the conversion of cortisone to 
cortisol, which is an estimate of hepatic HSD11B1 activity. This suggests that 
dysregulation of liver glucocorticoid metabolism in these patients is a 
consequence rather than a cause of metabolic dysfunction.
