The potential of a new poly(magnesium acrylate) hydrogel (PAMgA) as a 
pharmaceutical excipient for the elaboration of matrix tablets for the extended 
release of highly hydrophilic drugs was evaluated. The polymer was synthetized 
with two different crosslinking degrees that were characterized by FTIR and DSC. 
Their acute oral toxicity was determined in a mouse model, showing no toxicity 
at doses up to 10 g/kg. Matrix tablets were prepared using metformin 
hydrochloride as a model drug and the mechanisms involved in drug release 
(swelling and/or erosion) were investigated using biorrelevant media. This new 
hydrogel effectively controlled the release of small and highly hydrophilic 
molecules as metformin, when formulated in matrix tablets for oral 
administration. The rate of metformin release from PAMgA matrices was mainly 
controlled by its diffusion through the gel layer (Fickian diffusion). The 
swelling capacity and the erosion of the matrix tablets influenced the metformin 
release rate, that was slower at pH 6.8, where polymer swelling is more 
intensive, than in gastric medium, where matrix erosion is slightly more rapid. 
The crosslinking degree of the polymer significantly influenced its swelling 
capacity in acid pH, where swelling is moderate, but not in intestinal fluid, 
where swelling is more intense.
