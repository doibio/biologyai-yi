Metformin has been linked to improve survival of patients with various cancers. 
There is little information on survival of glioblastoma patients after use of 
metformin. We assessed the association between metformin use and survival in a 
pooled analysis of patient data from 1,731 individuals from the randomized 
AVAglio, CENTRIC and CORE trials. We performed multivariate Cox analyses for 
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) comparing patients' 
use of metformin at baseline and/or during concomitant radiochemotherapy 
(TMZ/RT). Further exploratory analyses investigated the effect of metformin with 
a history of diabetes and nonfasting glucose levels in relation to OS or PFS of 
glioblastoma patients. Metformin alone or in any combination was not 
significantly associated with OS or PFS (at baseline, hazard ratio [HR] for OS = 
0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65-1.16; HR for PFS = 0.84; 95% CI = 
0.64-1.10; during TMZ/RT HR for OS = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.68-1.38; HR for PFS = 
1.02; 95% CI = 0.74-1.41). We found a statistically nonsignificant association 
of metformin monotherapy with glioblastoma survival at baseline (HR for OS = 
0.68; 95% CI = 0.42-1.10; HR for PFS = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.36-0.91), but not during 
the TMZ/RT period (HR for OS = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.51-1.56; HR for PFS = 1.05; 95% 
CI = 0.64-1.73). Diabetes mellitus or increased nonfasting glucose levels were 
not associated with a difference in OS or PFS in our selected study population. 
Metformin did not prolong survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma 
in our analysis. Additional studies may identify patients with specific tumor 
characteristics that are associated with potential benefit from treatment with 
metformin, possibly due to metabolic vulnerabilities.
