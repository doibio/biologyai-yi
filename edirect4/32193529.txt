CONTEXT: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with an increased risk of 
fracture, but it is not clear which diabetes and nondiabetes risk factors may be 
most important.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate risk factors for incident major 
osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) of the hip, wrist, and humerus in African American 
(AA), Hispanic (HIS), and Caucasian (CA) subjects with DM.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 18 210 subjects with DM (7298 
CA, 7009 AA and 3903 HIS) at least 40 years of age, being followed at a large 
healthcare system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
RESULTS: In a global model in CA with DM, MOF were associated with dementia (HR 
4.16; 95% CI, 2.13-8.12), OSA (HR 3.35; 95% CI, 1.78-6.29), COPD (HR 2.43; 95% 
CI, 1.51-3.92), and diabetic neuropathy (HR 2.52; 95% CI, 1.41-4.50). In AA, MOF 
were associated with prior MOF (HR 13.67; 95% CI, 5.48-34.1), dementia (HR 3.10; 
95% CI, 1.07-8.98), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 45 (HR 2.05; 95% 
CI, 1.11-3.79), thiazide use (HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.93), metformin use (HR 
0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.97), and chronic steroid use (HR 5.03; 95% CI, 1.51-16.7). 
In HIS, liver disease (HR 3.06; 95% CI, 1.38-6.79) and insulin use (HR 2.93; 95% 
CI, 1.76-4.87) were associated with MOF.
CONCLUSION: In patients with diabetes, the risk of fracture is related to both 
diabetes-specific variables and comorbid conditions, but these relationships 
vary by race/ethnicity.
