and metformin.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate T-helper cytokine responses in a short-term high fat diet 
(HFD) induced impaired glucose metabolism. To further evaluate the modulation of 
T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokines using short-term low-dose 
aspirin in combination with metformin.
DESIGN: Two experiments were carried out in this study in order to evaluate the 
T-helper cytokine profiles in a state of impaired glucose metabolism. A total of 
28 six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were used in this study. In the first 
experiment, mice were fed either a high fat diet or low fat diet for a duration 
of 10 weeks. We then determined the Th1, Th2 and T-helper 17 (Th17) cytokine 
profiles. In the second experiment, we evaluated whether the short term 6-week 
treatment with low-dose aspirin in combination with metformin modulates T-helper 
cytokine profiles of the HFD-fed mice.
MEASUREMENTS: In the first experiment, we measured the body weights, blood 
glucose levels, insulin levels, lipid profiles and haematological parameters. We 
further performed oral glucose tolerance testing following an 8-hour fast and 
serum Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokine levels were also determined following 
short-term 8-week diet-feeding and 6-week low-dose aspirin and combined 
metformin with low-dose aspirin treatment.
RESULTS: High fat diet-feeding caused a marked increase in circulating 
peripheral blood lymphocytes, which was attenuated by short-term low-dose 
aspirin treatment. Moreover, the HFD feeding resulted in 2-fold increase in 
total cholesterol and a 4-fold increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
when compared to the low-fat diet-fed group (p < 0.05). In the high fat diet 
group, impaired glucose metabolism was associated with skewed Th2 responses 
without alterations in the Th1 and Th17 cytokine profiles. Interestingly the 
short-term treatment with low-dose aspirin showed no effect on the selected 
T-helper 1 cytokine IFN-Ƴ (P > 0.05). While the combination of low-dose aspirin 
with metformin considerably reduced the levels of serum IFN-Ƴ (P < 0.05). 
Furthermore low-dose aspirin treatment showed the modest attenuation of the 
selected Th2 cytokines, IL-10 and IL-13 when compared to low-dose aspirin with 
metformin (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The early immunological and metabolic changes that occur in a state 
impaired glucose tolerance are accompanied by the increased production of Th2 
cell cytokines. The short-term treatment using low-dose aspirin combined with 
metformin may provide therapeutic benefits in preventing complications 
associated with dysregulated Th2 cell responses.
