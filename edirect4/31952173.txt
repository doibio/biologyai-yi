Metformin (MET), 1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride, is a biguanide drug used 
as the first-line medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The recent 
years have brought many observations showing metformin in its new role. The 
drug, commonly used in the therapy of diabetes, may also find application in the 
therapy of a vast variety of tumors. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in 
colon, breast, prostate, pancreatic cancer, leukemia, melanoma, lung and 
endometrial carcinoma, as well as in gliomas. This is especially important in 
light of the poor options offered to patients in the case of high-grade gliomas, 
which include glioblastoma (GBM). A thorough understanding of the mechanism of 
action of metformin can make it possible to discover new drugs that could be 
used in neoplasm therapy.
