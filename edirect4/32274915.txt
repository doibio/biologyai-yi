Despite plenty of currently available information on metabolic syndrome (MetS) 
in children and adolescents, there are still uncertainties regarding definition, 
prevention, management and treatment of MetS in children. The first approach to 
MetS in children consists of lifestyle interventions (nutritional education, 
physical activity). These recommendations are often difficult to achieve, 
especially for adolescents, therefore, there is usually a lack of successful 
outcomes. A pharmacological intervention in obese children may be needed in some 
cases, with the aim to improve the effects of these primary prevention 
interventions. Metformin seems to be safe and presents evident positive effects 
on insulin sensitivity, but long-term and consistent data are still missing to 
establish its role in the pediatric population and the possible effectiveness of 
other emergent treatments such as glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, 
dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors, dual inhibitors of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and weight 
loss drugs. Bariatric surgery might be helpful in selected cases. The aim of 
this review is to present the most recent available treatments for the main 
components of metabolic syndrome, with a focus on insulin resistance. A short 
mention of management of congenital forms of insulin resistance will be included 
too.
