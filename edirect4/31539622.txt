AIMS: SUSTAIN 10 compared the efficacy and safety of the anticipated most 
frequent semaglutide dose (1.0mg) with the current most frequently prescribed 
liraglutide dose in Europe (1.2mg), reflecting clinical practice.
METHODS: In this phase 3b, open-label trial, 577 adults with type 2 diabetes 
(HbA1c 7.0-11.0%) on 1-3 oral antidiabetic drugs were randomized 1:1 to 
subcutaneous once-weekly semaglutide 1.0mg or subcutaneous once-daily 
liraglutide 1.2mg. Primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints were changes in 
HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 30, respectively.
RESULTS: Mean HbA1c (baseline 8.2%) decreased by 1.7% with semaglutide and 1.0% 
with liraglutide (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.69%; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] -0.82 to -0.56, P<0.0001). Mean body weight (baseline 96.9kg) 
decreased by 5.8kg with semaglutide and 1.9kg with liraglutide (ETD -3.83kg; 95% 
CI -4.57 to -3.09, P<0.0001). The proportions of subjects achieving glycaemic 
targets of<7.0% and=6.5%, weight loss of=5% and=10%, and a composite endpoint of 
HbA1c<7.0% without severe or blood glucose-confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
and no weight gain were greater with semaglutide vs liraglutide (all P<0.0001). 
Both treatments had similar safety profiles, except for more frequent 
gastrointestinal disorders (the most common adverse events [AEs]) and AEs 
leading to premature treatment discontinuation with semaglutide vs liraglutide 
(43.9% vs 38.3% and 11.4% vs 6.6%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Semaglutide was superior to liraglutide in reducing HbA1c and body 
weight. Safety profiles were generally similar, except for higher rates of 
gastrointestinal AEs with semaglutide vs liraglutide.
