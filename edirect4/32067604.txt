BACKGROUND: Metformin has been associated with improved survival outcomes in 
various malignancies. However, observational studies in head and neck cancer are 
inconsistent.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to summarize and quantify the relationship between 
metformin use and the survival of head and neck cancer.
METHODS: A meta-analysis based on cohort studies was systematically conducted 
(published up to Jan 18, 2020), identified from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, 
Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases. Summary hazard ratios 
(HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects 
model.
RESULTS: Seven retrospective cohort studies including 3,285 head and neck cancer 
patients were included. The association between the use of metformin and cancer 
survival was not statistically significant: summarized HR of 0.89 (95% CI 
0.66-1.18, P=0.413, I2=64.0%) for overall survival, summarized HR of 0.65 (95% 
CI 0.31-1.35, P=0.246, I2=60.3%) for disease-free survival, and summarized HR of 
0.69 (95% CI 0.40-1.20, P=0.191, I2=73.1%) for disease-specific survival.
CONCLUSION: In this meta-analysis of 7 retrospective cohort studies, there was 
not a statistically significant association between the use of metformin and 
better survival for head and neck cancer. However, the analysis may have been 
underpowered. More studies of prospective designs with larger sample sizes are 
needed to investigate the effect of metformin on the survival of head and neck 
cancer.
