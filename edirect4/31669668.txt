ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tinospora sinensis Lour. (Merr.) belongs to the 
family Menispermaceae and its stem extract have been used traditionally in broad 
aspects of therapeutic remedies including debility, dyspepsia, fever, jaundice, 
ulcer, bronchitis, urinary disease, skin disease, liver disease and diabetes.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to evaluate the protective effects of 
methanol extract of stem of Tinospora sinensis (METS) on streptozotocin induced 
pancreatic islet cell injuries of diabetic rats and its correlation to its 
phytochemical profiles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A high-performance liquid chromatography technique (HPLC) 
was used to identify and quantify the major phytochemicals present in the METS. 
Diabetic rats were administered with METS at a dose of (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg 
respectively orally) and standard drug Metformin (300 mg/kg) was given orally to 
group serving positive control. Effect of the METS on glucose homeostasis, 
oxidative stress, antioxidant status, histopathology of pancreas and also on 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential, 
apoptosis, cell cycle of pancreatic islet cells were studied in diabetic rats.
RESULTS: The major phytochemicals identified and quantified by HPLC in the 
extract were berberine, caffeic acid, myricetin and ferulic acid. This result 
showed that methanol extract exhibited good antioxidant effect. The methanol 
extract of the plant prevented the diabetogenic effect of STZ and significantly 
lowered the fasting blood glucose level, glycated haemoglobin and increased 
insulin and C-peptide level in treated rats. METS reduced apoptosis of STZ 
treated islet cells by significantly decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines 
(TNFα, IL6), intracellular ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide (NO) 
production and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and sub-G0 peak area, 
enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.
CONCLUSION: The results revealed that the methanol extract of the stem of the 
plant possesses protective effects against diabetes and associated 
complications.
