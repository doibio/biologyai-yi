BACKGROUND: Recent randomized control trials have described a protective 
cardiovascular effect of novel glucose lowering drugs in patients at high 
cardiovascular risk. Whether these second-line agents have similar effects in 
the general population is unknown. We aimed to compare the risk of major 
cardiovascular and adverse events in new users of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
inhibitors (SGLT-2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i), glucagon-like 
peptide 1 agonist (GLP-1a), and sulfonylurea in T2DM patients not controlled on 
metformin therapy.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the MarketScan database (2011-2015). 
We selected T2DM individuals who were newly dispensed sulfonylureas, SGLT-2i, 
DPP-4i, or GLP-1a, as second-line therapy, added to metformin. Cohort entry was 
defined by date of first prescription of the second-line agent. Time to first 
non-fatal cardiovascular or adverse event was compared using Cox regression 
models adjusted for confounders.
RESULTS: Among 118,341 T2DM patients using metformin (mean age: 56), most were 
at low cardiovascular risk (4% with previous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
event). During a median follow-up of 10 months compared with sulfonylureas 
users, cardiovascular risk was lower in users of SGLT-2i (aHR = 0.61; 95% CI: 
0.40-0.97), DPP-4i (aHR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.69-0.90) and GLP-1a (aHR = 0.65; 95% 
CI: 0.48-0.89). Serious adverse events were rare but compared with sulfonylurea, 
the risk was lower in new users of novel glucose lowering agents.
CONCLUSION: In our analyses, which included patients with and without prior 
cardiovascular disease, initiating novel glucose lowering drugs as second-line 
therapy for T2DM was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular and adverse 
events than sulfonylurea initiation.
