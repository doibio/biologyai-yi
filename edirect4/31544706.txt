OBJECTIVE: The ability of an aqueous extract of the sclerotia of Pleurotus 
tuberregium to modulate hematological parameters was investigated in normal and 
alloxan treated rabbits.
METHODS: The extract was subjected to atomic absorption spectrophotometric and 
flame ionization detector-coupled-gas chromatographic (GC-FID) analysis. 
Diabetes mellitus was induced by a 120 mg/kg body weight intravenous injection 
of alloxan. Metformin was orally administered at 50 mg/kg, while the extract was 
administered (both to normal and diabetic rabbits) at 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg.
RESULTS: Analysis of the extract showed that it had high contents of calcium, 
magnesium, manganese and potassium. Eleven known glycosides were detected, 
comprising mainly of amygdalin (37.7%), digoxin (14.4%), dhurrin (14.0%), 
linamarin (13.6%), prunasin (10.8%) and digitoxin (8.4%). Also detected were 
twelve known saponins, consisting mainly of sapogenin (40.3%) and neochlorogenin 
(21.8%); and twelve known lignans, consisting mainly of matairesinol (59.7%), 
secoisolariciresinol (20.9%) and lariciresinol (14.9%). Compared to the Diabetic 
control, the hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, mean cell hemoglobin, mean 
cell hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution 
width; and red cell, total white cell, lymphocytes, granulocytes and platelet 
counts of the treated groups were significantly (p<0.05) higher.
CONCLUSION: The above result showed that the extract had a positive effect on 
the hemopoietic system of the treated animals, at least at the doses at which it 
was administered in this study.
