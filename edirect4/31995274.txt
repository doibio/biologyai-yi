AIMS: We collected the different prescription patterns of diabetes medications 
in a cohort of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) and analysed the impact of different prescription patterns on clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive diabetic patients with HFrEF from a heart 
failure referral centre were retrospectively analysed between 2015 and 2016. 
Exclusion criteria include being lost to follow-up, not receiving diabetes 
medications, and having severe renal impairment with a glomerular filtration 
rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Prescription of diabetes medications and the 
respective clinical outcomes were collected between 2016 and 2018. Among 381 
patients (mean age, 64.8 ± 12.8 years; 71.9% male; mean left ventricular 
ejection fraction, 27.6 ± 7.0%; mean body mass index, 26.1 ± 4.7 kg/m2 ), the 
prescription rates of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) 
increased from 10.3% in 2016 to 17.6% in 2017 and 26.5% in 2018 (P < 0.001); the 
prescription rates of metformin, sulfonylurea, insulin, and dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitors did not change significantly over time. The prescription 
rates of metformin and SGLT2i were significantly higher in patients managed by 
cardiologists than non-cardiologists (in 2018, 71.1% vs. 44.2% for metformin, 
45.4% vs. 9.9% for SGLT2i, both P < 0.001). During the study period, annualized 
event rates of cardiovascular death or first unplanned HF hospitalization were 
19.0 per 100 patient-years. After a multivariate analysis, prescriptions of 
metformin {odds ratio (OR): 0.49 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.51], P < 
0.001} and SGLT2i [OR: 0.52 (95% CI 0.28-0.98), P = 0.042] were independently 
associated with lower annualized event rates of cardiovascular death or 
unplanned HF hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Prescription patterns of diabetes medications in diabetics with 
HFrEF were diverse among different specialists. Prescriptions of metformin and 
SGLT2i were associated with favourable clinical outcomes. Our finding indicates 
the importance of awareness of beneficial effect of different classes of 
diabetes medications and collaboration between specialists in the management of 
diabetic HFrEF patients.
