Anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy has greatly improved 
outcomes of patients with melanoma; however, many fail to respond. Although 
preclinical studies suggest a potentially synergistic relationship with 
anti-PD-1 therapy and certain concurrent medications, their clinical role 
remains unclear. Here, we retrospectively evaluated the use of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other drugs in 330 patients with melanoma 
treated with anti-PD-1 therapy from four academic centers. In the cohort, 37% of 
patients used NSAIDs including aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid; ASA; 47%), 
cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors (2%), and non-ASA/nonselective COX inhibitor 
NSAIDs (59%). The objective response rates (ORRs) were similar in patients with 
NSAID (43.4%) and no NSAID (41.3%) use with no significant difference in overall 
suvival (OS). There was a trend toward improved progression-free survival (PFS) 
in patients who took NSAIDs (median PFS: 8.5 vs. 5.2 months; p = .054). Most 
patients (71.3%) took NSAIDs once daily or as needed. Multivariate analysis did 
not reveal an association with NSAID use with ORR, PFS, or OS. Concurrent use of 
metformin or beta blockers did not affect ORR, PFS, or OS. Our study found no 
conclusive association of concurrent NSAID or other medication use with improved 
outcomes in patients with melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 therapy. Larger and 
more systematic analysis is required to confirm these findings.
