BACKGROUND: The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate remains at 50% for patients 
with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LAHNSCC), thereby 
underscoring the need for improved treatments. An antidiabetic agent, metformin, 
was found in retrospective studies to improve survival in patients with HNSCC. 
Therefore, the authors conducted a phase 1 dose escalation study combining 
metformin with chemoradiotherapy in patients with LAHNSCC.
METHODS: Nondiabetic patients with LAHNSCC were enrolled in the current study to 
receive escalating doses of metformin and CRT based on the modified toxicity 
probability interval design. Metformin cohort doses included 2000 mg, 2550 mg, 
and 3000 mg daily in divided doses in addition to cisplatin (at a dose of 
100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22, and 43) and standard radiotherapy (70 grays). Adverse 
events were categorized as per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03).
RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled, 2 of whom withdrew consent. The median 
age of the patients was 56 years and the majority were male (83%), were white 
(88%), had p16-positive disease (72%), and were tobacco users (61%). The median 
length of metformin exposure was 28.5 days. The most common grade ≥3 toxicities 
were nausea (11%), vomiting (11%), mucositis (6%), acute kidney injury (17%), 
anemia (6%), and leukopenia (11%). Dose-limiting toxicities included diarrhea 
and acute kidney injury. After a median follow-up of 19 months, the 2-year 
overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 90% and 84%, 
respectively. No hypoglycemia events or lactic acidosis were observed. Cisplatin 
administration did not appear to affect metformin pharmacokinetics. The maximum 
tolerated dose for metformin could not be determined given the limited number of 
patients who tolerated metformin during chemoradiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first phase 1 
trial combining metformin with chemoradiotherapy. Rates of overall survival and 
progression-free survival were encouraging in this limited patient population, 
and warrant further investigation in a phase 2 trial.
