OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of early management of hyperglycaemia with 
antidiabetic drugs plus lifestyle intervention compared with lifestyle alone, on 
microvascular function in adults with pre-diabetes.
METHODS: Trial design: International, multicenter, randomised, partially 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Males and females aged 45-74 years with IFG, IGT or IFG+IGT, 
recruited from primary care centres in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, 
Kuwait, Poland, Serbia, Spain and Turkey.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to placebo; metformin 1.700 mg/day; 
linagliptin 5 mg/day or fixed-dose combination of linagliptin/metformin. All 
patients were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention program (diet and physical 
activity). Drug intervention will last 2 years. Primary Outcome: composite 
end-point of diabetic retinopathy estimated by the Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study Score, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, and skin 
conductance in feet estimated by the sudomotor index. Secondary outcomes in a 
subsample include insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, biomarkers of 
inflammation and fatty liver disease, quality of life, cognitive function, 
depressive symptoms and endothelial function.
RESULTS: One thousand three hundred ninety one individuals with hyperglycaemia 
were assessed for eligibility, 424 excluded after screening, 967 allocated to 
placebo, metformin, linagliptin or to fixed-dose combination of metformin + 
linagliptin. A total of 809 people (91.1%) accepted and initiated the assigned 
treatment. Study sample after randomization was well balanced among the four 
groups. No statistical differences for the main risk factors analysed were 
observed between those accepting or rejecting treatment initiation. At baseline 
prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 4.2%, severe neuropathy 5.3% and 
nephropathy 5.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: ePREDICE is the first -randomized clinical trial with the aim to 
assess effects of different interventions (lifestyle and pharmacological) on 
microvascular function in people with pre-diabetes. The trial will provide novel 
data on lifestyle modification combined with glucose lowering drugs for the 
prevention of early microvascular complications and diabetes.
