BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions and medication nonadherence are well-known 
causes of sub-optimal disease control and worsened disease outcomes in patients 
who are treated for type 2 diabetes. Metformin sustained release (SR) might 
reduce these adverse events and improve medication adherence via a simplified 
treatment regimen for metformin immediate release (IR)-intolerant patients.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to estimate the budget impact of metformin 
SR for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands, compared to the 
current standard of care (SoC) with metformin IR.
METHODS: A budget impact model was built to represent the course of the disease 
and treatment pathway of type 2 diabetes patients eligible for metformin SR from 
a healthcare payer's perspective. Patients were considered eligible if they used 
less than 2000 mg metformin IR per day, but suffered from adverse events that 
might lead to therapy discontinuation, and if they were newly diagnosed with 
type 2 diabetes. The costs of type 2 diabetes treatment and related 
complications over a time horizon of 3 years were calculated. Univariate 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to show which parameters have the biggest 
influence on the budget impact.
RESULTS: The budget impact analysis showed cost-savings of - €1,962,335 over a 
period of 3 years through implementation of metformin SR as an alternative to 
SoC with metformin IR. Savings were mostly driven by the delay of other, more 
expensive type 2 diabetes treatments, such as insulin. In sensitivity analyses, 
medication adherence and persistence appeared to have the biggest influence on 
the budget impact.
CONCLUSION: Metformin SR could potentially be a cost-saving alternative to 
metformin IR for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands, especially 
in patients experiencing adverse events with metformin IR. However, more 
research is needed to better predict the effect of using once-daily metformin, 
compared to multiple dosages, on medication adherence and persistence and to 
evaluate whether metformin SR really decreases the amount of adverse events.
