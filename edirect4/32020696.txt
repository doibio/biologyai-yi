The present meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin + 
linagliptin combination compared with either monotherapy [n=6 randomized 
controlled trials; 2857 adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on diet + exercise ± 
metformin; 39.7% women; mean age: 54.6-59.9 years]. The combination of 
empagliflozin 10 mg + linagliptin 5 mg led to significantly greater reductions 
in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) compared with either drug alone over 24 weeks: 
weighted mean difference [WMD; -0.72%, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.04, 
-0.40], and fasting plasma glucose (-1.60 mmol/L 95% CI: -2.21, -1.00). Similar 
results were observed when empagliflozin 25 mg + linagliptin 5 mg was compared 
with linagliptin 5 mg monotherapy or with empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg monotherapy. 
Patients with T2DM treated with the drug combination had more than three times 
higher likelihood of achieving HbA1c <7% than those on either monotherapy. 
Weight reduction was significantly greater in the combination group only when 
compared with linagliptin monotherapy. Safety profile was similar between 
combination treatment and monotherapies. Overall, the empagliflozin + 
linagliptin combination had superior efficacy and similar safety in achieving 
euglycaemia compared with either monotherapy. This combination, administered 
once daily, has the potential to reduce regimen complexity, enhance adherence 
and improve outcomes in clinical practice.
