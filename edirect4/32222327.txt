OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to evaluate the relationship between 
survival and beta blocker use in both the primary and interval debulking setting 
while adjusting for frequently co-administered medications.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study reviewing charts of women who 
underwent primary or interval cytoreduction for stage IIIC and IV epithelial 
ovarian cancer. The exposure of interest was beta-blocker use identified at the 
time of cytoreduction. The outcomes of interest were PFS and OS. We collected 
demographic/prognostic variables and information about use of aspirin, 
metformin, and statins. We used the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional 
hazards models in survival analyses.
RESULTS: 534 women who underwent surgery for stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer 
were included in the study. The median age at diagnosis was 64 and 84.8% of 
women had serous carcinoma. We identified 105 women (19.7%) on a beta-blocker of 
whom 94 (90%) were on a cardioselective beta-blocker. Additionally, 24 women 
(4.5%) were on metformin, 91 (17%) on aspirin, and 128 (24%) on a statin. In 
univariable analysis, beta-blocker users had a median overall survival of 
29 months vs 35 months among non-users (hazard ratio HR = 1.52, p = 0.007). 
After adjustment for important demographic, clinical, and histopathologic 
factors, as well as use of other common medications, beta-blocker use remain 
associated with an increased hazard of death (adjusted HR 1.57, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, we found that patients identified as 
being on a beta-blocker at the time of surgery had worse overall survival and 
greater risk of death when compared to those patients not on betablockers. 
Importantly, 90% of patients on beta-blockers were identified as being on a 
cardioselective beta-blocker.
