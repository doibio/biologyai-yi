BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced enteritis and proctitis are common side effects of 
abdominopelvic cancers among patients that undergo radiotherapy for prostate, 
colorectal or urinary cancers. Exposure of these tissues to high doses of 
radiation leads to damage to villous, inflammation, pain, ulcer and bleeding, 
which may cause malabsorption and gastrointestinal disorders. To date, several 
procedures such as pharmaceutical treatment have been proposed for protection 
and mitigation of gastrointestinal toxicity following radiotherapy.
AIMS: In the current study, we aimed to investigate the possible radioprotection 
of ileum and colon in rats using a combination of melatonin and metformin.
METHODS: In this experimental study, 30 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned 
to six groups: control, melatonin (100 mg/kg) treatment, melatonin (100 mg/kg) 
plus metformin (100 mg/kg) treatment, radiation (10 Gy to whole body) group, 
radiation + melatonin (100 mg/kg) treatment, and radiation + melatonin (100 
mg/kg) plus metformin (100 mg/kg) treatment. After 3.5 days, rats were 
sacrificed and their ileum and colon tissues carefully removed. 
Histopathological evaluations were conducted on these tissue samples.
RESULTS: Histological evaluations reported moderate to severe damages to ileum 
and colon following whole body irradiation. Melatonin administration was able to 
protect the ileum remarkably, while the combination of melatonin and metformin 
was less effective. Interestingly, for the colon, melatonin was less effective 
while its combination with metformin was able to protect against radiation 
toxicity completely.
CONCLUSION: For the ileum, melatonin was a more effective radioprotector 
compared to its combination with metformin. However, the combination of 
melatonin and metformin can be proposed as an ideal radioprotector for the 
colon.
