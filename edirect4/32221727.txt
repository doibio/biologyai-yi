PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim was to review evidence about diabetes secondary to 
hereditary pancreatitis, seeking novel diagnostic and treatment features.
RECENT FINDINGS: Hereditary pancreatitis (HP) is an autosomal dominant 
condition, characterized by recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, 
progression to fibrosis, and chronic pancreatitis. Clinical presentation 
includes diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (DEP). HP prevalence ranges from 0.3 
to 0.57 per 100,000 people, with up to 80% of these develop DEP. This condition 
often requires specific interventions: with regard to metabolic control, 
metformin is the first choice for those with mild DEP, and for those in advanced 
disease, insulin is considered the first-line therapy. Insulin analogues and 
insulin pump therapy are preferred due to the brittle glycemic pattern and risk 
of hypoglycemia. In case of exocrine insufficiency, pancreatic enzyme 
replacement therapy is recommended. Pancreatic polypeptide administration is a 
promising novel treatment feature. DEP due to HP appears to be a misdiagnosed 
condition. The requirement of specific management demonstrates the importance of 
this matter; therefore, appropriate recognition and classification are 
important.
