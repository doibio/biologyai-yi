Metformin along with other antidiabetic medications provide benefit to patients 
in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but caution is advised in certain 
scenarios to avoid toxicity in kidney disease. Renal dosing, monitoring of 
kidney function, and evaluating the risk of developing serious side effects are 
warranted with some agents. The available literature with regard to incidence of 
adverse events and toxicity of hypoglycemic therapies is reviewed.
