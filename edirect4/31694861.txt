OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of RVT-1502, a novel oral glucagon 
receptor antagonist, in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on 
metformin.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled study, subjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 166) on a stable 
dose of metformin were randomized (1:1:1:1) to placebo or RVT-1502 5, 10, or 15 
mg once daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in 
HbA1c for each dose of RVT-1502 compared with placebo. Secondary end points 
included change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and safety 
assessments.
RESULTS: Over 12 weeks, RVT-1502 significantly reduced HbA1c relative to placebo 
by 0.74%, 0.76%, and 1.05% in the 5-, 10-, and 15-mg groups (P < 0.001), 
respectively, and FPG decreased by 2.1, 2.2, and 2.6 mmol/L (P < 0.001). The 
proportions of subjects achieving an HbA1c <7.0% were 19.5%, 39.5%, 39.5%, and 
45.0% with placebo and RVT-1502 5, 10, and 15 mg (P ≤ 0.02 vs. placebo). The 
frequency of hypoglycemia was low, and no episodes were severe. Mild increases 
in mean aminotransferase levels remaining below the upper limit of normal were 
observed with RVT-1502 but were reversible and did not appear to be dose 
related, with no other liver parameter changes. Weight and lipid changes were 
similar between RVT-1502 and placebo. RVT-1502-associated mild increases in 
blood pressure were not dose related or consistent across time.
CONCLUSIONS: Glucagon receptor antagonism with RVT-1502 significantly lowers 
HbA1c and FPG, with a safety profile that supports further clinical development 
with longer-duration studies (NCT02851849).
