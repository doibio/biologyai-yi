The human gut microbiota has now been associated with drug responses and 
efficacy, while chemical compounds present in these drugs can also impact the 
gut bacteria. However, drug-microbe interactions are still understudied in the 
clinical context, where polypharmacy and comorbidities co-occur. Here, we report 
relations between commonly used drugs and the gut microbiome. We performed 
metagenomics sequencing of faecal samples from a population cohort and two 
gastrointestinal disease cohorts. Differences between users and non-users were 
analysed per cohort, followed by a meta-analysis. While 19 of 41 drugs are found 
to be associated with microbial features, when controlling for the use of 
multiple medications, proton-pump inhibitors, metformin, antibiotics and 
laxatives show the strongest associations with the microbiome. We here provide 
evidence for extensive changes in taxonomy, metabolic potential and resistome in 
relation to commonly used drugs. This paves the way for future studies and has 
implications for current microbiome studies by demonstrating the need to correct 
for multiple drug use.
