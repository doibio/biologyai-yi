BACKGROUND: Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent extensively used as 
first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes. It improves hyperglycemia by suppressing 
hepatic glucose production and increasing glucose uptake in muscles. Metformin 
improves insulin sensitivity and shows a beneficial effect on weight control. 
Besides its metabolic positive effects, Metformin has direct effects on 
inflammation and can have immunomodulatory and antineoplastic properties.
AIM: The aim of this narrative review was to summarize the up-to-date evidence 
from the current literature about the metabolic and non-metabolic effects of 
Metformin.
METHODS: We reviewed the current literature dealing with different effects and 
properties of Metformin and current recommendations about the use of this drug. 
We identified keywords and MeSH terms in Pubmed and the terms Metformin and type 
2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, heart failure, PCOS, etc, were searched, 
selecting only significant original articles and review in English, in 
particular of the last five years.
CONCLUSION: Even if many new effective hypoglycemic agents have been launched in 
the market in the last few years, Metformin would always keep a place in the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes and its comorbidities because of its multiple 
positive effects and low cost.
