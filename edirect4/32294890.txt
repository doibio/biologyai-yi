The current study explored the effect of isoorientin on the metabolic activity 
and lipid accumulation in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To achieve 
this, the 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were differentiated for eight days and treated 
with various concentrations of isoorientin (0.1-100 μM) for four hours. 
Subsequently, the metabolic activity, lipid accumulation, and mitochondrial 
respiration were assessed. Furthermore, to unravel the molecular mechanisms that 
might elucidate the bioactivity of isoorientin, protein expression of the genes 
involved in insulin signaling and energy expenditure, such as AKT and AMPK, were 
investigated. The results showed that isoorientin, at different doses, could 
block lipid storage and enhance glycerol release, with a concomitant improvement 
of the metabolic activity and mitochondrial function. Although the observed 
beneficial effects of isoorientin on these cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes were not 
consistent at all concentrations, it was clear that doses between 1 and 10 μM 
were most effective compared to the untreated control. Moreover, the activity of 
isoorientin was comparable to tested positive controls of CL-316,2431, 
isoproterenol, insulin, and metformin. Mechanistically, protein expression of 
AKT and AMPK, was enhanced with isoorientin exposure, suggesting their partial 
role in modulating lipid metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Indeed, our 
results showed that isoorientin has the ability to enhance mitochondrial 
respiration, as we observed an increase in the ATP and oxygen consumption rate. 
Therefore, we concluded that isoorientin has a potential to impact mitochondrial 
activity, lipid metabolism and energy expenditure using an in vitro experimental 
model of obesity.
