Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article has 
been retracted at the request of the authors. The authors found that the 
experiment to show that HG decreased CD31 (Figure 1 E) and increased Vimentin 
(Figure 1 F) mRNA level could not be repeated. Moreover, they found that HG had 
no effect on Ch25h protein level and cannot repeat the experiments that HG 
decreased Ch25h mRNA level (Figure 1 G). In summary, they cannot conclude that 
HG suppressed EndoMT through KLF4/Ch25h, which made great weakening to the 
protection of KLF4/Ch25h axis in blood glucose dysfunction-induced endothelial 
dysfunction and diabetes. The authors wish to apologize for any inconvenience 
they may have caused.
