BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), the visceral fat depot of 
the heart, is a modifiable cardio-metbolic risk factor and therapeutic target. 
Semaglutide and dulaglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, 
are indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GLP-1 
receptor agonists have recently shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Epicardial 
adipose tissue expresses GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs). GLP-1 receptor agonist 
liraglutide is known to significantly decrease EAT thickness. However, the 
effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists semaglutide and dulaglutide on EAT thickness 
are unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a 12-week, controlled, parallel study in 80 
subjects with T2DM and obesity. Patients received either semaglutide, up to 1 mg 
subcutaneous (sc) weekly, or dulaglutide, up to 1.5 mg sc weekly, as the 
standard of care in addition to their usual medication regimen. Twenty subjects 
with T2DM and obesity were started on metformin and a diet and served as the 
control group. Ultrasound-measured EAT thickness was measured at baseline and at 
the 12-week follow-up.
RESULTS: Epicardial adipose tissue thickness significantly decreased in both 
semaglutide and dulaglutide groups (P < 0.001) after 12 weeks, accounting for a 
20% reduction. There was no EAT reduction in the metformin group. Body mass 
index (BMI) and HbA1c improved in all groups without reaching statistical 
significance. Epicardial adipose tissue thickness reduction was significantly 
greater (P < 0.01) with the higher doses of semaglutide (1 mg) and dulaglutide 
(1.5 mg), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Weekly administration of either GLP-1 receptor agonists semaglutide 
or dulaglutide causes a rapid, substantial, and dose-dependent reduction in EAT 
thickness.
