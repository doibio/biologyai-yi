BACKGROUND/AIM: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are rare pancreatic 
neoplasms, and therapeutic options for pNETs are limited. Metformin is an 
anti-hypoglycemic drug that appears to have anticancer effects. However, little 
is known about the effect of metformin on pNETs. In this study, we investigated 
the anti-proliferative effect of metformin on a human pNET cell line.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-proliferative properties of metformin were 
evaluated in QGP-1 and NCI-H727 cells using a cell counting kit-8 assay. 
Xenograft mouse models were used to assess the tumor effect in vivo.
RESULTS: Metformin inhibited the proliferation and anti-tumor growth of QGP-1 
cells, accompanied by their arrest during the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues revealed down-regulation of cyclin 
D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in the metformin-treated group. 
Additionally, metformin induced apoptosis, and the expression of survivin and 
claspin were decreased in metformin-treated QGP-1 cells according to the 
apoptosis array. Furthermore, the angiogenic related protein TIMP-1 was 
down-regulated, and its miRNA expression was altered by metformin in QGP-1 
cells.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of 
metformin and provides molecular mechanistic insights into its anti-tumoral 
effect on pNETs. This study is the first one describing anti-tumoral effects in 
pNETs.
