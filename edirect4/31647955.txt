Metformin, as the basic pharmacological therapy and the first preventive drug in 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is proved to have potential protection in 
diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Here, we established a diabetic rat model induced 
by high-fat diet and low dose streptozotocin, and high glucose cultured rat 
mesangial cells (RMCs) pre-treated with metformin or transfected with AMPK, 
SIRT1 and FoxO1 small interfering RNA, and detected oxidative stress and 
autophagy related factors to explore the molecular mechanisms of metformin on 
DKD via adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/silent mating 
type information regulation 2 homolog-1 (sirtuin-1, SIRT1)-Forkhead box protein 
O1 (FoxO1) pathway. We found that metformin effectively alleviated the disorders 
of glycolipid metabolism, renal function injury in diabetic rats, and relieved 
oxidative stress, enhanced autophagy and slowed down abnormal cell proliferation 
in high glucose cultured RMCs through AMPK/SIRT1-FoxO1 pathway, indicating the 
protective role of metformin against the pathological process of DKD.
