PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The gut microbiota has been speculated to underpin metabolic 
changes associated with chronic antipsychotic use. The change in the gut 
microbiota can also cause abnormal absorbtion from the gut into the blood stream 
(leaky gut syndrome) that can lead to inflammatory reactions, and thus, 
secondary damage to the brain and central nervous system. Our article aims to 
highlight relevant research on antipsychotic's effect on the microbiota and to 
point out future directions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Antipsychtoic use can result in specific microbiota changes, 
and it is important to differentiate this from the innate microbiota of the 
patient. It is important to treat these microbiota changes, as they are 
correlated with obesity, which is a negative contributor to the cardiovascular 
health of those suffering with schizophrenia. Ways to prevent 
antipsychotic-induced side-effects include antibiotic treatment, histamine 3 
receptor blockade and metformin use.
SUMMARY: Given the dearth of current literature, more research is needed, 
however, to determine, which comes first in people with schizophrenia--an 
abnormal gut microbiota that elevates one's risk for schizophrenia or 
psychopharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia leading to secondary microbiota 
abnormalities or the negative symptoms of schizophrenia leading to obesity and 
its associated microbiota changes.
