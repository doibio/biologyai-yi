Chronic consumption of unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle induces fatty 
liver and metabolic complications. Adipocytes get overloaded with lipid 
succeeding low-grade inflammation and disrupting adipokine release. This 
research aims to investigate the effect of sitagliptin on white adipose tissue 
inflammation, adipokine level, metabolic syndrome, and fatty liver through 5' 
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In sixteen 
weeks of the experimental protocol, Swiss albino mice were kept in a standard 
environment and were fed 60% high-fat diet and 20% fructose water (HFFW) where 
they developed metabolic syndrome features, adipose tissue inflammation, and 
altered adipokine profile. Sitagliptin was administered for the last eight 
weeks. They were allocated to following six groups, control diet with regular 
water (1), HFFW only (2), HFFW and metformin 100 mg/kg (3), HFFW and sitagliptin 
10 mg/kg (4), HFFW and sitagliptin 20 mg/kg (5), and HFFW and sitagliptin 
30 mg/kg (6). Fasting serum insulin (FSI), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), 
adipokines (adiponectin and leptin), serum lipid profile, hepatic lipid content, 
and white adipose tissue inflammation were assessed. Protein expression of 
P-AMPK, P-Acetyl co-a carboxylase (ACC), and mRNA expression of fatty acid 
metabolism genes were also evaluated in the liver. Sitagliptin significantly and 
effectively reversed metabolic syndrome complexity. FSI and GLP-1 levels were 
improved. A significant reduction in hepatic lipid content and oxidative stress 
was also observed. Also, sitagliptin significantly ameliorated adipose tissue 
inflammation and adiponectin levels at 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg. P-AMPK and P-ACC 
expression increased significantly. Moreover, expression of fatty acid synthesis 
genes was down-regulated, and fatty acid oxidation genes were up-regulated. 
Sitagliptin significantly ameliorated obesity-induced adipose tissue 
inflammation, metabolic syndrome, and fatty liver via regulation of adiponectin 
and AMPK levels in obese mice. Also, increased GLP-1 levels would have induced 
insulin-independent effects on adipose tissue and liver.
