INTRODUCTION: Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is rare despite its 
widespread use. It is often associated with the use of metformin in the presence 
of chronic kidney disease, but it may also occur in people with normal renal 
function in the case of acute overdose.
CASE REPORT: 20 years old (patient 1) and 37 years old (patient 2) women without 
any chronic disease took 40 gram (727 mg/ kg) and 60 gram (1200 mg/kg) 
metformin, respectively; for the suicidal attempt. Deep lactic acidosis was 
detected in patients. In patient 1, hemodialysis was performed for 4 hours. 
After the interruption, deep acidosis evolved again and another dialysis session 
was performed. In patient 2, hemodialysis was performed for 16 hours without any 
interruption and she did not need any other dialysis session.
CONCLUSION: Metformin has a large distribution volume. It is not correct to make 
a final decision as to how long the dialysis will continue when dialysis begins. 
Dialysis should be continued without interruption until clinical and laboratory 
targets are achieved.
