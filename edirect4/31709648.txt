AIMS: To examine whether the presence of two common missense variants in the 
CYP2C9 gene (rs1799853, encoding Arg144Cys and denoted as *2, and rs1057910, 
encoding Ile359Leu and denoted as *3) influences the acute physiological 
response to a single glipizide dose in individuals naïve to diabetes 
medications.
METHODS: In the Study to Understand the Genetics of the Acute Response to 
Metformin and Glipizide in Humans (SUGAR-MGH), 786 individuals genotyped for 
rs1799853/rs41291560 (*2) and rs1057910/rs9332214 (*3) were treated with 5 mg 
glipizide in the fasting state. Glucose and insulin levels were measured at 
baseline, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min for calculation of phenotypic 
endpoints of glipizide response. The challenge was aborted as a result of 
hypoglycaemia, defined as glucose <2.8 mmol/l or hypoglycaemia-related symptoms.
RESULTS: Carriers with two reduced function alleles had a 50% larger insulin 
area under the curve than carriers with zero or one copy (P=0.037), although 
this finding was primarily driven by an individual with a robust insulin 
response. In adjusted analyses, the risk of aborting the glipizide challenge was 
doubled in two-copy carriers (P=0.034). No significant findings were observed in 
glucose-based endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of two reduced function alleles in CYP2C9 may experience 
an increased insulin response to glipizide and be predisposed to a higher risk 
of hypoglycaemia, although no effect of genotype was seen in glucose-based 
measurements. Further studies are needed to clarify the utility of CYP2C9 
genotyping to guide sulfonylurea treatment.
