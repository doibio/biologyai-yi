BACKGROUND: Metformin is associated with improved survival among hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) patients with diabetes mellitus. However, the role of metformin 
in the survival of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients with diabetes 
mellitus after radical resection is unclear, so this study aimed to assess the 
effects of metformin on the clinical outcomes of patients who received radical 
resection for HCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 250 HCC patients (30-78 years old) diagnosed 
with diabetes mellitus were selected between 2000 and 2013 from the First 
Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University and the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery 
Hospital in China. Patients were divided into the metformin group (n = 66) and 
the nonmetformin group (n = 184). A propensity score matching analysis was 
performed to evaluate the effect of metformin in patients receiving radical 
resection for HCC.
RESULTS: In the propensity score-matched cohort (n = 176), the overall survival 
(OS) in the metformin group at 1, 3, and 5 years was significantly higher than 
in the nonmetformin group (P = 0.002), and a similar treatment effect was 
observed for disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.030). The adjusted Cox 
proportional hazards model showed that metformin usage significantly improved OS 
[hazard ratio: 0.558, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.385-0.810].
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin is associated with satisfactory clinical outcomes among 
HBV-related HCC patients with diabetes mellitus after radical resection. The use 
of metformin could significantly improve the OS and reduce the risk of HCC 
recurrence in patients after radical resection. A prospective controlled study 
is recommended to verify the metformin effect and explore its possible 
mechanisms.
