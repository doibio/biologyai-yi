BACKGROUND: To evaluate whether anti-diabetic medications are related to 
colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in type 2 diabetes patients.
METHODS: The study was performed from a population-based prospective cohort 
provided by the National Health Insurance Corporation (2007-2014). Among the 
2,084,602 patients newly diagnosed as type 2 diabetes in this period, the cases 
had incident CRC identified at least 3 years after the diagnosis, and the 
controls were matched to each case by age, sex, body mass index (BMI), fasting 
plasma glucose level, and year of the diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression 
was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and its 95 % confidence 
intervals (CIs) for CRC by anti-diabetic medications.
RESULTS: A total of 4,228 cases were identified and 4,228 controls were matched 
to the cases. Sulfonylurea use increased the risk for CRC [aOR (95 % CI), 1.14 
(1.05-1.25)], showing an increasing trend with increasing cumulative doses (p 
for trend = 0.0008). In subgroup analysis, sulfonylurea use increased the CRC 
risk in DM patients ≥ 65 years, but not in the patients < 65 years. Among 
sulfonylurea drugs, gliclazide decreased the CRC risk [0.85 (0.72-1.00), p <  
0.05], whereas glimepiride increased the risk significantly [1.14 (1.06-1.22)]. 
In contrast, metformin, meglitide, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors, and α-glucosidase inhibitor use did not modify the CRC risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that sulfonylureas except for gliclazide 
increase the CRC risk in type 2 diabetic patients. Long-term follow-up studies 
are necessary to clarify the association of newer anti-diabetic medications with 
the CRC incidence.
