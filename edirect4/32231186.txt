Tumor cell metabolism is considered one of the hallmarks of cancer. This concept 
is exploited in the development of new ways of anticancer therapy based on the 
use of substances capable of changing drastically bioenergetic metabolism of 
tumor cells. Among them, sodium dichloroace-tate (DCA), an inhibitor of pyruvate 
dehydrogenase kinase, and metformin (MTF), an antidiabetic hypoglycemic drug, an 
inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), both have been 
long used in clinical non-oncological practice, and presently are considered 
promising candidates in oncology.
AIM: To study the capability of MTF to enhance the antitumor action of DCA 
against Lewis lung carcinoma cells in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: LLC/R9, a low metastatic variant of Lewis lung carcinoma 
cells, was used. Effects of 30 mM DCA in combination with 2 mM MTF on cell 
survival, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, mitochondrial potential, 
intracellular ATP level, glucose consumption, and lactate production rates were 
determined in vitro.
RESULTS: MTF was shown to enhance the cytotoxic/cytostatic action of DCA against 
LLC/R9 cells in vitro. Treatment of LLC/R9 cells with 30 mM DCA in combination 
with 2 mM MTF resulted in a 39% decrease in the number of viable cells (p < 
0.05), a 2.8-fold increase of the number of dead cells (p < 0.05), a near 2-fold 
decrease in the proportion of cells at the S-phase (p < 0.05), a 4-fold increase 
in the apoptosis (p < 0.05) and significant reduction (p < 0.05) of the 
mitochondrial membrane potential of tumor cells as compared to corresponding 
values in control. DCA alone reduced glucose consumption and lactate production 
rates by more than 26% (p < 0.05) and 34% (p < 0.05), respectively, whereas MTF 
counteracted these effects. Nevertheless, in the cells treated with both DCA and 
DCA in combination with MTF, the intracellular adenosine triphosphate increased 
by 33-35% compared with that in the control (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: MTF enhanced the cytotoxic/cytostatic action of DCA against LLC/R9 
cells in vitro, which points on their possible synergistic antitumor action in 
vivo.
