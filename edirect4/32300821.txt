AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We analysed data obtained from the electronic patient records 
of inpatients with diabetes admitted to a large university hospital to 
understand the prevalence and distribution of inpatient hypoglycaemia.
METHODS: The study was conducted using electronic patient record data from 
Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The dataset contains hospital 
admission data for patients coded for diabetes. We used the recently agreed 
definition for a level 1 hypoglycaemia episode as any blood glucose measurement 
<4 mmol/l and a level 2 hypoglycaemia episode as any blood glucose measurement 
<3 mmol/l. Any two or more consecutive low blood glucose measurements within a 
2 h time window were considered as one single hypoglycaemic episode.
RESULTS: We analysed data obtained from 17,658 inpatients with diabetes (1696 
with type 1 diabetes, 14,006 with type 2 diabetes, and 1956 with other forms of 
diabetes; 9277 men; mean ± SD age, 66 ± 18 years) who underwent 32,758 hospital 
admissions between July 2014 and August 2018. The incidence of level 1 
hypoglycaemia was 21.5% and the incidence of level 2 hypoglycaemia was 9.6%. 
Recurrent level 1 and level 2 hypoglycaemia occurred, respectively, in 51% and 
39% of hospital admissions in people with type 2 diabetes with at least one 
hypoglycaemic episode, and in 55% and 45% in those with type 1 diabetes. The 
incidence of level 2 hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes, when 
corrected for the number of people who remained in hospital, remained constant 
for the first 100 h at approximately 0.15 events per h per admission. With 
regards to the hypoglycaemia distribution during the day, after correcting for 
the number of blood glucose tests per h, there were two clear spikes in the rate 
of hypoglycaemia approximately 3 h after lunch and after dinner. The highest 
rate of hypoglycaemia per glucose test was seen between 01:00 hours and 05:00 
hours. Medication had a significant impact on the incidence of level 2 
hypoglycaemia, ranging from 1.5% in people with type 2 diabetes on metformin 
alone to 33% in people treated with a combination of rapid-acting insulin 
analogue, long-acting insulin analogue and i.v.-administered insulin.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Retrospective analysis of data from electronic 
patient records enables clinicians to gain a greater understanding of the 
incidence and distribution of inpatient hypoglycaemia. This information should 
be used to drive evidence-based improvements in the glycaemic control of 
inpatients through targeted medication adjustment for specific populations at 
high risk of hypoglycaemia.
