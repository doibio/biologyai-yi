PURPOSE: Treatment for patients with recurrent endometrioid endometrial cancer 
(EEC) are limited as paclitaxel is the only second-line chemotherapy with a 
response rate >13%. Targeting PIK3/mTOR in combination with hormonal therapy has 
shown promise. The addition of metformin may enhance this response. We conducted 
a phase II study evaluating everolimus, letrozole, and metformin in 
advanced/recurrent EEC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Simon two-stage design was employed. Women with ≤2 prior 
chemotherapy regimens for recurrence were eligible. Pretreatment biopsy was 
required, followed by everolimus 10 mg orally, letrozole 2.5 mg orally, and 
metformin 500 mg orally twice a day on a 4-week cycle. The primary endpoint was 
clinical benefit (CB), defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), 
or stable disease (SD) confirmed at 16 weeks. Patients were treated until 
progression or toxicity.
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were enrolled. Median age was 62 years (40-77) with 
401 cycles completed, median of 6 cycles (1-31). Fifty-four patients were 
evaluable for response with a CB rate of 50% (27/54). Best overall response (OR) 
was PR 28% (15/54) and SD 22% (12/54). Thirteen patients received >12 cycles. 
Median follow-up was 17.9 months (2-47). Median progression-free survival was 
5.7 [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.0-8.1] and OS was 19.6 months (95% CI, 
14.2-26.3). Positive progesterone receptor expression was associated with CB 
(89.5% vs. 27.3%, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus, letrozole, and metformin resulted in 50% CB and 28% OR 
in women with recurrent EEC. Progesterone receptor-positive tumors may have 
better response; validation studies are needed.See related commentary by
