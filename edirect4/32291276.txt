OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between ATP7B mutations and diabetes in 
Wilson disease (WD).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 21 exons and exon-intron boundaries of 
ATP7B were identified by Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: Two novel compound heterozygous mutations (c.525 dupA/ Val176Serfs*28 
and c.2930 C>T/ p.Thr977Met) were detected in ATP7B. After d-penicillamine 
(D-PCA) therapy, serum aminotransferase and ceruloplasmin levels in this patient 
were normalized and levels of HbA1c decreased. However, when the patient ceased 
to use D-PCA due to an itchy skin, serum levels of fasting blood glucose 
increased. Dimercaptosuccinic acid capsules were prescribed and memory recovered 
to some extent, which was accompanied by decreased insulin dosage for glucose 
control by 5 units.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of diabetes caused by WD.
