Epidemiological evidence for the association between postdiagnostic metformin 
use and survival in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains limited. Using 
the Taiwan Cancer Registry database, a cohort of 16,676 diabetic patients newly 
diagnosed with CRC from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2014, followed 
until December 31, 2016, was identified. Postdiagnostic use of metformin (two or 
more prescriptions after CRC diagnosis) was defined as a time-dependent 
covariate with 6-month lag. Multivariate Cox regression model and stabilized 
inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to estimate adjusted 
effects of metformin on all-cause mortality and CRC-specific mortality during 
follow-up. A number of 11,438 (69%) received metformin after CRC diagnosis. 
Overall, 7,393 deaths, including 4,845 CRC-specific deaths, were observed during 
64,322 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for demographic and clinical 
covariates, metformin users had lower all-cause mortality than did nonusers 
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.44) and lower 
CRC-specific mortality (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.39-0.44). Similar but somewhat 
attenuated effects were observed after stabilized IPTW (HR for all-cause 
mortality, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.53-0.59; HR for CRC-specific mortality, 0.58; 95% CI, 
0.55-0.61). Similar results were observed in stratified analyses of 2,112 
patients with no prediagnostic metformin use and 14,564 patients with 
prediagnostic metformin use. Findings for both outcomes were consistent in 
multiple sensitivity analyses. Use of postdiagnostic metformin was associated 
with significantly lower all-cause mortality and CRC-specific mortality, 
regardless of prior metformin use. These findings support the use of metformin 
as an adjunct to standard care of diabetic patients with CRC.
