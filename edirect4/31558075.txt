BACKGROUND: Metformin is increasingly used in clinical practice for the 
treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus. However, its safety and long-term 
effects on fetuses exposed to metformin in uterus remain controversial.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database 
(last search was updated on 1 May 2019) for randomized controlled trials 
comparing metformin with insulin. Two reviewers extracted the data and 
calculated pooled estimates by use of a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included. Among these, seventeen RCTs 
(N = 2828 participants) were included for quantitative analyses and seven 
studies were included only for qualitative synthesis. Metformin lowered the risk 
of pregnancy-induced hypertension (p = .03; risk ratio (RR) = 0.64; confidence 
interval (95%CI) [0.44, 0.95]), large for gestational age babies (p = .04; 
RR = 0.82; 95% CI [0.68, 0.99]), macrosomia (p = .01; RR = 0.63; 95%CI [0.45, 
0.90]), neonatal hypoglycemia (p = .001; RR = 0.72; 95%CI [0.59, 0.88]), and 
neonatal intensive care unit admission (p = .01; RR = 0.74; 95%CI [0.58, 0.94]). 
Metformin did not increase premature delivery (p = .11; RR = 1.28; 95%CI [0.95, 
1.73]), preeclampsia (p = .45; RR = 0.89; 95%CI [0.65, 1.21]), caesarean 
delivery (p = .20; RR = 0.94; 95%CI [0.85, 1.04]), small for gestational age 
babies (p = .95; RR = 0.99; 95%CI [0.69, 1.42]). The long-term results seemed to 
have no adverse effect, but the information was still limited.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our review, metformin may have potential benefits for 
pregnant women and newborns with no obvious adverse effects. However, even more 
studies are needed to provide evidence for the future use of metformin.
