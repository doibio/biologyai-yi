INTRODUCTION: Despite treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), achieving 
effective glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains a challenge. The 
objective of this post hoc analysis of data from the SUSTAIN 2, 3, 4 and 10 
active-controlled trials was to assess the efficacy and safety of the 
once-weekly glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) semaglutide in 
patients on background treatment with metformin (MET), with or without a 
sulphonylurea (SU).
METHODS: Data from the randomised phase 3 trials SUSTAIN 2, 3, 4 and 10 for 
subjects who received background MET alone or MET + SU were analysed. Change 
from baseline in HbA1c and body weight at the end of treatment visit (week 30 in 
SUSTAIN 4 and 10, week 56 in SUSTAIN 2 and 3), and rates of hypoglycaemia and 
adverse events leading to premature treatment discontinuation were assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 3411 subjects were included in the full analysis set (3410 in 
the safety analysis set). Across the four trials, semaglutide significantly 
reduced HbA1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] - 0.32 to - 0.79%-points for 
semaglutide 0.5 mg, and - 0.38 to - 1.07%-points for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs 
comparators; p < 0.01) in subjects receiving both MET and MET + SU. Regardless 
of background OAD, semaglutide significantly reduced body weight (ETD - 2.35 to 
- 4.72 kg for semaglutide 0.5 mg, and - 2.96 to - 6.76 kg for semaglutide 1.0 mg 
vs comparators; p < 0.0001). Across the trials, hypoglycaemic events were more 
common with background MET + SU than MET alone, in subjects receiving either 
semaglutide or a comparator. The rate of adverse events (AEs) leading to 
premature treatment discontinuations in subjects treated with semaglutide were 
generally consistent regardless of background therapy.
CONCLUSION: Semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg significantly improve glycaemic 
control (HbA1c) and body weight in subjects with T2D, with a similar 
tolerability profile, regardless of whether they receive background MET or 
MET + SU.
