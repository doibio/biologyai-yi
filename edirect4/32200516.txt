BACKGROUND: Tissue-engineered muscles ("myobundles") offer a promising platform 
for developing a human in vitro model of healthy and diseased muscle for drug 
development and testing. Compared to traditional monolayer cultures, myobundles 
better model the three-dimensional structure of native skeletal muscle and are 
amenable to diverse functional measures to monitor the muscle health and drug 
response. Characterizing the metabolic function of human myobundles is of 
particular interest to enable their utilization in mechanistic studies of human 
metabolic diseases, identification of related drug targets, and systematic 
studies of drug safety and efficacy.
METHODS: To this end, we studied glucose uptake and insulin responsiveness in 
human tissue-engineered skeletal muscle myobundles in the basal state and in 
response to drug treatments.
RESULTS: In the human skeletal muscle myobundle system, insulin stimulates a 50% 
increase in 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake with a compiled EC50 of 0.27 ± 0.03 nM. 
Treatment of myobundles with 400 µM metformin increased basal 2-DG uptake 
1.7-fold and caused a significant drop in twitch and tetanus contractile force 
along with decreased fatigue resistance. Treatment with the histone deacetylase 
inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) increased the magnitude of insulin response 
from a 1.2-fold increase in glucose uptake in the untreated state to a 1.4-fold 
increase after 4-PBA treatment. 4-PBA treated myobundles also exhibited 
increased fatigue resistance and increased twitch half-relaxation time.
CONCLUSION: Although tissue-engineered human myobundles exhibit a modest 
increase in glucose uptake in response to insulin, they recapitulate key 
features of in vivo insulin sensitivity and exhibit relevant drug-mediated 
perturbations in contractile function and glucose metabolism.
