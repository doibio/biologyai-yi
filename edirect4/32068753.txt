Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that commonly occurs 
among older individuals. Increasing evidence suggests that a low-caloric diet 
might be a promising adjuvant therapeutic strategy for slowing or preventing the 
pathogenesis and progression of AD through the induction of autophagy. Several 
intracellular pathways have been implicated in caloric restriction (CR)-induced 
autophagy. In this review, we summarized the efficacy of CR as well as its 
mimetics (resveratrol, spermidine, aspirin, rapamycin, metformin, and curcumin) 
in improving cognitive function of rodent models of AD. On the basis of recent 
in vitro and animal studies, the beneficial effects of CR- or caloric 
restriction mimetics-induced autophagy in alleviating amyloid burden and tau 
pathology of AD were also discussed.
