An adsorbent was developed from the residues of Moringa oleifera Lam. seed husks 
functionalized with iron nanoparticles for subsequent application to the removal 
of metformin from contaminated water. The material, MOM-Fe3O4, was characterized 
using TEM, SEM imaging, and EDX analysis, which revealed that iron nanoparticles 
were retained in the pores. The application of MOM-Fe3O4 to waste water resulted 
in a 93.9% reduction in the metformin content, demonstrating the efficacy of the 
material. Kinetic and equilibrium data were fitted to the pseudo-first-order and 
Langmuir models, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters indicated an 
exothermic and reversible process. A high adsorption capacity, 65.01 mg g-1 at 
298 K, demonstrated the potential of using the new material as a low-cost 
adsorbent for the removal of pharmaceuticals such as metformin.
