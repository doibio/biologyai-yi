AIM: To examine whether early addition of sitagliptin to metformin is associated 
with a delay in type 2 diabetes progression.
METHODS: Administrative health records from Alberta, Canada, for the period 
April 2008 to March 2015, were used to conduct a retrospective cohort study in 
new metformin users. People who started sitagliptin on the same day they 
initiated metformin therapy were compared with those who added sitagliptin 
later. Insulin initiation served as a surrogate marker for diabetes progression, 
and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the 
association with sitagliptin addition (costart vs later use). A mixed-effects 
linear regression model was used to examine the effect of timing of sitagliptin 
addition on HbA1c change over 1 year.
RESULTS: The mean (sd) age of the 8764 people who used sitagliptin was 52.1 
(11.1) years, 5665 (64.6%) were men, and 1153 (13.2%) started sitagliptin on the 
same day as metformin. Insulin was added to the therapy of 173 (15.0%) 
costarters and 1453 (19.1%) later sitagliptin users. The adjusted odds ratio for 
adding insulin was 0.76 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.90) in favour of costarting 
sitagliptin. HbA1c levels decreased in both groups 1 year after starting 
sitagliptin, with costarters having a significantly greater reduction [absolute 
between-group difference of 0.5% (95% CI 0.3 to 0.7)] compared with later 
sitagliptin users.
CONCLUSION: Costarting drug therapy with sitagliptin and metformin was 
associated with a lower likelihood of disease progression in people with type 2 
diabetes compared with adding sitagliptin later.
