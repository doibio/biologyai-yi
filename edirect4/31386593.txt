The microbiome is known to regulate many aspects of host health and disease and 
is increasingly being recognized as a key mediator of drug action. However, 
investigating the complex multidirectional relationships between drugs, the 
microbiota, and the host is a challenging endeavor, and the biological 
mechanisms that underpin these interactions are often not well understood. In 
this review, we outline the current evidence that supports a role for the 
microbiota as a contributor to both the therapeutic benefits and side effects of 
drugs, with a particular focus on those used to treat mental disorders, type 2 
diabetes, and cancer. We also provide a snapshot of the experimental and 
computational tools that are currently available for the dissection of 
drug-microbiota-host interactions. The advancement of knowledge in this area may 
ultimately pave the way for the development of novel microbiota-based strategies 
that can be used to improve treatment outcomes.
