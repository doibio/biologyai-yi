Clinical and experimental evidences indicate that epigenetic modifications 
induced by the prenatal environment are related to metabolic and reproductive 
derangements in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Alterations in the leptin and 
adiponectin systems, androgen signalling and antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels 
have been observed in PCOS women and in their offspring. Using a targeted 
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), we studied DNA methylation in promoter regions 
of the leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), adiponectin 
receptor 1 and 2 (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2), AMH and androgen receptor (AR) genes in 
24 sons and daughters of women with PCOS (12 treated with metformin during 
pregnancy) and 24 children born to non-PCOS women during early infancy 
(2-3 months of age). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood, bisulphite 
converted and sequenced by NGS. Girls showed differences between groups in 1 CpG 
site of LEPR, 2 of LEP, 1 of ADIPOR2 and 2 of AR. Boys showed differences in 5 
CpG sites of LEP, 3 of AMH and 9 of AR. Maternal metformin treatment prevented 
some of these changes in LEP, ADIPOR2 and partially in AR in girls, and in LEP 
and AMH in boys. Maternal BMI at early pregnancy was inversely correlated with 
the methylation levels of the ChrX-67544981 site in the whole group of girls 
(r = -0.530, p = 0.008) and with the global Z-score in all boys (r = -0.539, p 
= 0.007). These data indicate that the intrauterine PCOS environment predisposes 
the offspring to acquire certain sex-dependent DNA methylation patterns in the 
promoter regions of metabolic and reproductive genes.
