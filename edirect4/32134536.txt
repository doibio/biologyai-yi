OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment regimens and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) 
levels in Type 1 (T1D) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) using diabetes registries from 
two countries-U.S. SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) and Indian Registry of 
youth onset diabetes in India (YDR).
METHODS: The SEARCH and YDR data were harmonized to the structure and 
terminology in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. 
Data used were from T1D and T2D youth diagnosed <20 years between 2006-2012 for 
YDR, and 2006, 2008, and 2012 for SEARCH. We compared treatment regimens and A1c 
levels across the two registries.
RESULTS: There were 4003 T1D (SEARCH = 1899; YDR = 2104) and 611 T2D (SEARCH = 
384; YDR = 227) youth. The mean A1c was higher in YDR compared to SEARCH 
(T1D:11.0% ± 2.9% vs 7.8% ± 1.7%, P < .001; T2D:9.9% ± 2.8% vs 7.2% ± 2.1%, 
P < .001). Among T1D youth in SEARCH, 65.1% were on a basal/bolus regimen, 
whereas in YDR, 52.8% were on once/twice daily insulin regimen. Pumps were used 
by 16.2% of SEARCH and 1.5% of YDR youth with T1D. Among T2D youth, in SEARCH 
and YDR, a majority were on metformin only (43.0% vs 30.0%), followed by 
insulin + any oral hypoglycemic agents (26.3% vs 13.7%) and insulin only (12.8% 
vs 18.9%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: We found significant differences between SEARCH and YDR in treatment 
patterns in T1D and T2D. A1c levels were higher in YDR than SEARCH youth, for 
both T1D and T2D, irrespective of the regimens used. Efforts to achieve better 
glycemic control for youth are urgently needed to reduce the risk of long-term 
complications.
