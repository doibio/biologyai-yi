AIMS: Lowering postprandial lipemia may mitigate cardiovascular risk in patients 
with diabetic dyslipidemia. This study was aimed to investigate whether 
saroglitazar suppresses postprandial lipemia in patients with diabetes and 
dyslipidemia.
METHODS: This was a 12-week, prospective, multicenter, randomized, 
double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of saroglitazar in patients with 
diabetes and dyslipidemia. Thirty patients were randomized (1:1) to receive 
saroglitazar 4 mg or placebo orally once daily with metformin for 12 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was change in plasma triglyceride (TG) area under the curve 
(AUC) on a standardized 8-h fat tolerance test.
RESULTS: Thirty participants were randomized for interventions and eventually 
data of 19 participants qualified for per protocol analyses. Mean (SD) age in 
saroglitazar was 53.1 (8.8) years and 54.9 (7.7) years in placebo group. After 
12 weeks, saroglitazar significantly lowered postprandial TG-AUC by - 458.3 
(144.0) (- 25.7%, 95% CI - 765.1 to - 151.4) versus an increase of + 10.9 
(157.9) (+ 0.5%, 95% CI - 325.6 to 347.3) mg/dL h in placebo group (P < 0.05). 
Saroglitazar lowered postprandial TG incremental AUC versus placebo: - 329.4 
(89.9) (- 59%) versus + 80.4 (99.4) (+ 10%) mg/dL h (P < 0.05). HbA1c (%) 
decreased by - 0.36 (0.42) in the saroglitazar group as compared to an increase 
of + 1.26 (0.46) (P < 0.05) with placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: The saroglitazar treatment significantly improved postprandial TGs 
in people with diabetic dyslipidemia.
