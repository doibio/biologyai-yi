Metformin is an oral drug widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of metformin in cancer 
treatment. However, for metformin to elicit effects on cancer often requires a 
high dosage, and any underlying mechanism for how to improve its inhibitory 
effects remains unknown. Here, we found that low mRNA expression of 
glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) may predict a poor response to 
metformin treatment in 15 cancer cell lines. In vitro and in vivo, metformin 
treatment alone significantly suppressed cancer cell proliferation, a phenotype 
enhanced by GPD1 overexpression. Total cellular glycerol-3-phosphate 
concentration was significantly increased by the combination of GPD1 
overexpression and metformin treatment, which suppressed cancer growth via 
inhibition of mitochondrial function. Eventually, increased reactive oxygen 
species and mitochondrial structural damage was observed in GPD1-overexpressing 
cell lines treated with metformin, which may contribute to cell death. In 
summary, this study demonstrates that GPD1 overexpression enhances the 
anticancer activity of metformin and that patients with increased GPD1 
expression in tumor cells may respond better to metformin therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: 
GPD1 overexpression enhances the anticancer effect of metformin through 
synergistic inhibition of mitochondrial function, thereby providing new insight 
into metformin-mediated cancer therapy.
