To enhance the compliance of drug delivery for patients, the novel near-infrared 
(NIR) light-triggered and separable microneedles (MNs) have been developed in 
this work. Firstly, prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs) as the photo-thermal 
conversion factor and metformin as the hypoglycemic drug were embedded into the 
separable arrowheads, which consisted by poly (vinyl alcohol) and sucrose 
(PVA/Suc). The arrowheads of MNs were located on soluble solids supporting 
substrates that produced by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). Lauric acid (LA) as 
the phase transition coating covered on the surface of the MNs due to its lower 
phase transition temperature (~44 °C). Then, the separable arrowheads could be 
left into the skin because of the absorbing the interstitial fluid (IF) by the 
solid supporting substrates. With the irradiation of NIR light, LA could be 
melted due to the role of PB NPs in photo-thermal conversion, thus releasing the 
metformin from arrowheads. Compared with the traditional subcutaneous 
injections, the hypoglycemic effect was evaluated by the drug-release behaviors 
induced by NIR in vivo. The results showed that metformin could be allowed to 
on-demand release under the NIR irradiation. And the as-obtained MNs exhibited a 
good hypoglycemic effect, hypotoxicity and low inflammation reaction compared 
with those of traditional subcutaneous injections. The results indicate that the 
fabricated MNs have the potential treatment for diabetes due to their safety, 
convenience and painlessness.
