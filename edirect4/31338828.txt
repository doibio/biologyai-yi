OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of exenatide 
2 mg/week compared with other glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists 
(dulaglutide 1.5 mg/week, liraglutide 1.2 mg/day, liraglutide 1.8 mg/day and 
lixisenatide 20 μg/day) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
not adequately controlled on metformin alone from the perspective of the Spanish 
National Health System (NHS).
METHODS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and total costs of each 
assessed drug combined with metformin (2 g/day) were estimated over a 40-year 
time horizon using the Cardiff Diabetes Model (based on UK Prospective Diabetes 
Study [UKPDS] 68 equations), which simulates disease progression considering the 
T2DM-related micro- and macrovascular complications, hypoglycaemia, nausea, body 
mass index (BMI) changes and treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects 
(AEs). Drug efficacy derived from an indirect comparison performed in a network 
meta-analysis. Patient characteristics were obtained from the literature. The 
baseline utility value (0.80) was derived from the PANORAMA study, applying 
utility decrements to micro- and macrovascular complications, hypoglycaemia 
episodes and changes in BMI. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs or poorly 
controlled diabetes (HbA1c > 7.5%) involved switching to second-line (basal 
insulin) or third-line (basal-bolus insulin) treatment. Total cost (€, 2018) 
included the costs of drug acquisition, hypoglycaemia, weight gain, micro- and 
macrovascular complications, nausea and treatment discontinuation due to AEs. An 
annual discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and outcomes. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed.
RESULTS: In base-case, exenatide 2 mg/week resulted in more QALYs (8.26) than 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg/week (8.19 QALYs), liraglutide 1.2 mg/day (8.10 QALYs), 
liraglutide 1.8 mg/day (8.20 QALYs) and lixisenatide 20 μg/day (8.13 QALYs). 
Total cost/patient was €20,423.27 (exenatide 2 mg/week), €22,611.94 (dulaglutide 
1.5 mg/week), €21,065.97 (liraglutide 1.2 mg/day), €24,865.69 (liraglutide 
1.8 mg/day) and €21,334.58 (lixisenatide 20 μg/day). Deterministic SA confirmed 
the robustness of the model. In the probabilistic SA, 95-99% of the 1000 Monte 
Carlo iterations performed were under a hypothetical willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €20,000/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide 2 mg/week would be a dominant strategy (more effective 
and less costly) versus the other GLP-1 receptor agonists assessed for the 
treatment of T2DM patients who are not adequately controlled on metformin alone.
