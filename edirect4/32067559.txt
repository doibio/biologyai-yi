The objective of this review article was to identify and examine current 
evidence surrounding the potential renoprotective effects of newer antidiabetic 
agents such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, glucose-like 
peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. A 
literature search of MEDLINE and PubMed (January 2000 to April 2019) was 
performed using the following search terms: "diabetes treatment," 
"renoprotection," "kidneys," "SGLT-2 inhibitors," "GLP-1 receptor agonists," 
"DPP-4 inhibitors," and the drug names in each of those classes as well as any 
combination of these terms. Literature was excluded if published in a language 
other than English, performed in nonhuman subjects, did not include patients 
from the United States, was nonrandomized, or the data were available from 
poster presentations. There were 11 studies that met the search criteria. The 
majority of the studies focused on renal outcomes as secondary end points and 
looked at albuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate changes from 
baseline, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, serum creatinine, and need for 
renal replacement therapy. There are fewer studies that focused on renal 
protection as a primary end point. After reviewing the available literature, the 
use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists in addition to standard of care may 
be considered in patients with or at risk of developing chronic kidney disease. 
SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists should be considered when patients' 
diabetes is no longer well controlled with metformin. Other factors such as 
cost, cardiovascular disease, and other comorbidities may also be taken into 
consideration when recommending therapy for patients.
