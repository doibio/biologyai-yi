BACKGROUND: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that treatment 
with metformin be considered for prevention of type 2 diabetes in persons with 
prediabetes. However, metformin use outside the setting of diagnosed diabetes in 
US adults is not well characterized.
OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in self-reported prediabetes and treatment with 
metformin. We also compared characteristics of adults self-reported prediabetes 
who were vs. were not taking metformin.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults â‰¥ 20 years of age who participated in the 2005-2014 
National Health and Nutrition and Examination Survey (NHANES), n = 28,461.
APPROACH: We characterized trends in self-reported prediabetes and metformin use 
in this population. We used multiple logistic regression models to identify 
predictors of metformin use among adults with self-reported prediabetes. All 
analyses accounted for the weighted complex survey design to generate nationally 
representative estimates.
KEY RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported prediabetes increased from 5.1% in 
2005-2006 to 7.4% in 2013-2014 (P-for-trend < 0.001). In persons with 
self-reported prediabetes, metformin use increased, from 2.4 to 8.3% 
(P-for-trend = 0.013). Adults who were taking metformin were more likely to be 
obese and to report trying to lose weight in the past year.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported prediabetes has increased in the past decade. 
Metformin use in the setting of prediabetes has also increased but remains 
relatively uncommon at 8% in adults who self-report prediabetes, despite current 
clinical recommendations.
