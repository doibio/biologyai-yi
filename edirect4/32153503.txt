Studies investigating the potential link between adult pre-menopausal obesity 
[as measured by body mass index (BMI)] and triple-negative breast cancer have 
been inconsistent. Recent studies show that BMI is not an exact measure of 
metabolic health; individuals can be obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) and metabolically 
healthy or lean (BMI < 25 kg/m2) and metabolically unhealthy. Consequently, 
there is a need to better understand the molecular signaling pathways that might 
be activated in individuals that are metabolically unhealthy and how these 
signaling pathways may drive biologically aggressive breast cancer. One key 
driver of both type-2 diabetes and cancer is insulin. Insulin is a potent 
hormone that activates many pathways that drive aggressive breast cancer 
biology. Here, we review (1) the controversial relationship between obesity and 
breast cancer, (2) the impact of insulin on organs, subcellular components, and 
cancer processes, (3) the potential link between insulin-signaling and cancer, 
and (4) consider time points during breast cancer prevention and treatment where 
insulin-signaling could be better controlled, with the ultimate goal of 
improving overall health, optimizing breast cancer prevention, and improving 
breast cancer survival.
