OBJECTIVE: Metformin, an oral medication used for type 2 diabetes mellitus, is 
the most commonly prescribed drug with less economic burden of patients. 
Although metformin's efficacy and safety have long been recognized, 
approximately 5% of the patients treated with this drug develop severe diarrhea 
as an adverse effect and have to abandon treatment. Because there is no animal 
model to study metformin-induced diarrhea, it is hard to develop methods to 
maintain quality of life of patients prescribed with metformin.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using mouse models, we tried to develop an 
evaluation system for metformin-induced diarrhea to improve diarrheal symptoms 
in patients with diabetes. Healthy (C57BL/6J) and diabetic obese (db/db) mice 
were subjected to a stepwise dose escalation of metformin (250 mg/kg/day 
(125 mg/kg twice daily oral dose)-1000 mg/kg/day (500 mg/kg twice daily oral 
dose)), and fecal moisture contents and their score were monitored. To evaluate 
anti-diarrheal medications, wood creosote (a traditional medicine) was tested. 
Several groups of enterobacteria in fresh feces were examined by using PCR.
RESULTS: 1000 mg/kg/day (four times maximal effective dose) of metformin 
significantly increased fecal moisture content. Although no symptoms of diarrhea 
were observed in healthy C57BL/6J mice, the same dose of metformin induced 
severe diarrhea in diabetic obese db/db mice. A reduction in PCR signals for the 
Firmicutes group was associated with metformin-induced diarrhea. Wood creosote 
reduced diarrhea (high water-content) without affecting metformin's efficacy or 
enterobacterial flora levels.
CONCLUSIONS: We have created the first animal model of metformin-induced 
diarrhea using db/db mice, which will provide better quality of life for 
patients suffering from diarrhea caused by metformin.
