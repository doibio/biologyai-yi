Pediatric obesity is complex-in every way. The pathogenesis, which is a result 
of a multitude of factors combined with social and environmental factors makes 
it a crisis with overwhelming challenges. It is difficult to treat pediatric 
obesity; however, guidelines attempt to clarify how to approach treatment. These 
strategies are mostly interventions in lifestyle because only 1 medication is 
approved for treating obesity in children. The approach to the treatment of 
pediatric obesity will need to be a one that relies on the available data, a 
continued drive for additional research and publication, sharing of practice 
experience, and continued efforts at prevention.
