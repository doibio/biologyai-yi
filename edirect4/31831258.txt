OBJECTIVES: Our aim in this study was to determine whether differences exist in 
time to treatment intensification in newly treated type 2 diabetes patients in 
Canada and the United States (US).
METHODS: Two separate retrospective cohorts of diabetes patients were used from 
Canada and the US. Time to treatment intensification (i.e. addition of a second 
antihyperglycemic agent after initial metformin use) was determined using 
multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: Among new metformin users in 2004‒2007 (2,116 Canadians and 2,631 
Americans) >65 years of age, the median time to treatment intensification was 
362 days for Canadians and 170 days for Americans (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.99; 
95% confidence interval, 1.69 to 2.36). In a second cohort of all adult ages 
with clinical data between 2008 and 2010 (23,022 Canadians and 19,318 
Americans), the median time to treatment intensification was 197 days for 
Canadians and 119 days for Americans (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.62; 95% 
confidence interval, 5.246 to 6.029). At treatment intensification, the mean 
glycated hemoglobin was 9.0% (standard deviation, 2.0) in Canada and 8.6% 
(standard deviation, 2.2) in the US (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical practice guidelines are similar between Canada 
and the US, Canadian clinicians have historically demonstrated more clinical 
inertia compared with their US counterparts with respect to intensifying 
antihyperglycemic therapy. It is relatively unknown whether these differences 
currently exist or whether Canadian clinicians have closed the gap.
