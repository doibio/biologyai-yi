The high morbidity and mortality of cancer requires innovative therapeutics. 
Very recently, several old drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) or currently undergoing clinical trials, such as 
2-deoxy-d-glucose, disulfiram, artemisinin, chloroquine, metformin, and aspirin, 
which have been extensively applied clinically for the treatment of other 
diseases with reliable evidence of biosafety, have been engineered into 
nanosystems for enhancing cancer therapy. These old drugs can cooperate with 
other components of nanosystems or the ambient biological environment, to favor 
tumor-specific therapeutics by nontoxicity-to-toxicity transition. This 
Minireview provides a concentrated summary of the most recent progress made in 
this emerging field, highlighting the "old drugs, new uses" strategy for the 
construction of next-generation nanomedicines. It is expected that the clinical 
translation of nanomedicines can be accelerated by repurposing old drugs to 
elevate cancer therapeutic efficacy and specificity.
