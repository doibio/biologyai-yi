PURPOSE: To use the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies 
(CNODES) to describe drug utilization of antidiabetic medications in four 
Canadian provinces.
METHODS: With the use of data from CNODES, we constructed cohorts of patients 
with type 2 diabetes in four Canadian provinces (Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and 
Saskatchewan) who received their first-ever prescription for a noninsulin 
antidiabetic medication during the study period, defined as the earliest date of 
data availability in each province (range: 1993-1998) to the latest date of the 
data extraction in each province (range: 2013-2014). Prescriptions rates were 
calculated for all prescriptions by class and described over time.
RESULTS: Across provinces, we identified 650 830 patients who initiated 
antidiabetic medications during the study period. In most provinces, the overall 
prescription rate of antidiabetic medications increased during the last two 
decades. Metformin particularly increased in popularity, surpassing 
sulfonylureas in all provinces as the most widely prescribed antidiabetic 
medication by the early 2000s. Thiazolidinediones grew in popularity from the 
onset of their availability until 2006 to 2007, at which point they rapidly 
declined. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors saw substantial growth in several 
provinces following their addition to provincial formularies in 2008 to 2012, 
while glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists experienced modest growth. Insulin 
prescription rates remained constant or steadily increased over the last two 
decades.
CONCLUSIONS: CNODES can be used for cross-jurisdictional drug utilization 
studies. In Canada, trends in antidiabetic medication prescriptions followed 
changing guidelines reflecting up-to-date knowledge of drug effectiveness and 
safety.
