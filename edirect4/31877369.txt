The extracts of S. oleraceus Linn (SOL) and its main phenolic compounds have 
shown anti-diabetic effects, but their underlying mechanisms for glucose 
homeostasis remain unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the 
anti-diabetic mechanism of SOL by using the streptozocin (STZ) induced diabetic 
rat model. When diabetic rats were fed with SOL at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day for 6 
weeks, the concentrations of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were reduced by 43%, 22%, and 16%, 
respectively. Meanwhile, it was also found that daily feeding of SOL to diabetic 
rats led to a decrease in plasma glucose level by approximately 23%. Positive 
effects were observed on glucose homeostasis due to the down-regulation of 
AMPK/Akt/GSK-3β pathway, as indicated by the suppressions of adenosine 
5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein kinase (Akt) 
phosphorylation, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β), and the hepatic 
insulin resistance. In HepG2 cells, AMPK, Akt and GSK-3β showed a consistent 
transcript regulation. SOL at dose of 400 mg/kg/day feeding for 6 weeks showed a 
positive effect comparable to metformin.
