Metformin is an affordable and well-tolerated drug used in type 2 diabetes. 
Potential anticancer effects of metformin in gynecologic malignancies include 
inhibition of the PI3K-mTOR pathway, hormone receptor regulation, and reduction 
of fibrosis and inflammation. Multiple studies are currently assessing its role 
in cancer prevention and as a treatment enhancer.See related articles by Soliman 
et al., p. 581, and McCloskey et al., p. 632.
