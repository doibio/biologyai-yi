BACKGROUND: Previous studies demonstrated impaired lipid metabolism and 
augmented aerobic glycolysis in AF. The authors aimed to investigate whether the 
use of metformin, an AMPK activator, could reverse this metabolic remodeling in 
chronic AF and to explore the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: We conducted chronic AF animal models with 18 beagle dogs and divided 
them into SR (pacemaker implanted without pacing), AF (pacemaker implanted with 
sustained pacing at a frequency of 400 beats/min for 6 weeks), and metformin+AF 
group (daily oral administration of metformin was initiated 1 week before 
surgery and continued throughout the study period). After electrophysiological 
measurements, the left atrial appendage tissue samples were taken from the 
beating heart for further analysis. Protein expression, histological analysis, 
and biochemical measurements were conducted.
RESULTS: The AF groups showed decreased expression of FAT/CD36, CPT-1, VLCAD, 
increased concentration of free fatty acid and triglyceride, and increased lipid 
deposition. The activation of AMPK/PGC-1α/PPARα pathway was decreased. The key 
factors of the Warburg effect, including HIF-1α, GLUT-1, PDK1, HK, and LDH, 
increased in AF group compared to SR group. The expression of PDH decreased 
significantly, accompanied by increased atrial lactate production. The extent of 
fibrosis increased significantly in the left atrial appendage of AF group. dERP, 
∑WOV, and AF inducibility increased while ERP decreased in AF group compared to 
SR group. The use of metformin attenuated all these changes effectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin improves lipid metabolism and reverses the Warburg effect 
in chronic AF via AMPK activation. It attenuates atrial electrical and 
structural remodeling.
