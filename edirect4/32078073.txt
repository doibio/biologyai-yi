Cyclo Olefin Polymer (COP) based microbioreactors on a microfluidic chip were 
produced in house by hot-embossing and thermo-compression bonding methods. The 
chip allows two different experiments to be performed on trapped cells at the 
same time. On one side of the chip, red fluorescent protein (RFP) tagged 
nucleolar Nop56 protein was used to track changes in cell cycle as well as 
protein synthesis within the yeast cells under the application of the anti-tumor 
agent hydroxyurea (HU). Simultaneously, on the other side of the chip, the 
response of yeast cells to the drug metformin, mTOR inhibitor, was investigated 
to reveal the role of TOR signaling in ribosome biogenesis and cell 
proliferation. The results of 20 h long experiments are captured by taking 
brightfield and fluorescent microscopy images of the trapped cells every 9 min. 
The expression of Nop56 protein of ribosome assembly and synthesis was densely 
observed during G1 phase of cell cycle, and later towards the end of cell cycle 
the ribosomal protein expression slowed down. Under HU treatment, the morphology 
of yeast cells changed, but after cessation of HU, the biomass synthesis rate 
was sustained as monitored by the cell perimeter. Under metformin treatment, the 
perimeters of single cells were observed to decrease, implying a decrease in 
biomass growth; however these cells continued their proliferation during and 
after the drug application. The relation between ribosome biogenesis and cell 
cycle was successfully investigated on single cell basis, capturing cell-to-cell 
variations, which cannot be tracked by regular macroscale bioreactors.
