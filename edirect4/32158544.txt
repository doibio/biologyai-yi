BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignant bone tumor that often develops 
during the period of rapid growth associated with adolescence. Despite 
successful primary tumor control accompanied by adjuvant chemotherapy, death 
from pulmonary metastases occurs in approximately 30% of patients within 
5 years. As overall survival in patients remains unchanged over the last 
30 years, urgent needs for novel therapeutic strategies exist. Cancer metastasis 
is characterized by complex molecular events which result from alterations in 
gene and protein expression/function. Recent studies suggest that metabolic 
adaptations, or "metabolic reprogramming," may similarly contribute to cancer 
metastasis. The goal of this study was to specifically interrogate the metabolic 
vulnerabilities of highly metastatic OS cell lines in a series of in vitro and 
in vivo experiments, in order to identify a tractable metabolically targeted 
therapeutic strategy for patients.
METHODS: Nutrient deprivation and drug treatment experiments were performed in 
MG63.3, 143B, and K7M2 OS cell lines to identify the impact of glutaminase-1 
(GLS1) inhibition and metformin treatment on cell proliferation. We functionally 
validated the impact of drug treatment with extracellular flux analysis, nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. 13C-glucose and 
13C-glutamine tracing was employed to identify specific contributions of these 
nutrients to the global metabolic profiles generated with GLS1 inhibition and 
metformin treatment in vivo.
RESULTS: Highly metastatic OS cell lines require glutamine for proliferation, 
and exposure to CB-839, in combination with metformin, induces both primary 
tumor growth inhibition and a distinct reduction in metastatic outgrowth in 
vivo. Further, combination-treated OS cells showed a reduction in cellular 
mitochondrial respiration, while NMR confirmed the pharmacodynamic effects of 
glutaminase inhibition in tumor tissues. We observed global decreases in 
glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle functionality, alongside an 
increase in fatty acid oxidation and pyrimidine catabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests combination-treated cells cannot compensate for 
metformin-induced electron transport chain inhibition by upregulating 
glutaminolysis to generate TCA cycle intermediates required for cell 
proliferation, translating into significant reductions in tumor growth and 
metastatic progression. This therapeutic approach could be considered for future 
clinical development for OS patients presenting with or at high risk of 
developing metastasis.
