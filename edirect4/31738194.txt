OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence rate and risk 
factors of medication-related problems (MRPs) leading to hospital admissions in 
Thai older patients.
METHODS: A prospective observational study was carried out in nine hospitals in 
Lower Northern Thailand. Participants admitted to internal medicine units were 
screened for suspected MRPs by clinical pharmacists using medical record review 
and patient interview. Three experts evaluated suspected MRPs independently 
using the following four criteria: contribution of MRPs to hospital admissions, 
causality, severity, and preventability.
RESULTS: Of 1776 patients admitted during the study period, 56 patients (3.2%) 
were deemed to have causal MRPs; 24 (42.9%) were judged as preventable. The 
medication groups most commonly associated with MRPs were those targeting the 
endocrine system, especially antidiabetic medications, such as metformin and 
glipizide. Preventable MRPs were usually manifest as hypoglycemia (n = 15, 
62.5%). The variables that contributed to hospital admissions associated with 
MRPs were age (odds ratio = 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-3.47), 
starting a new drug within 1 week (odds ratio = 2.31; 95% CI = 1.08-4.95), or 
within 1 month (odds ratio = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.05-4.48).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admissions associated with MRPs in Thai older patients 
continue to burden the Thai healthcare system of which nearly half were 
preventable. Further studies should consider analysis of costs and include 
hepatic and renal function status of participants.
