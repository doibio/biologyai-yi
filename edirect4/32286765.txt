INTRODUCTION: A paradoxical negative association between diabetes mellitus and 
abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) prevalence and growth is established. However, 
so far is not possible to determine whether this protection comes from the 
disease itself or the medication for Diabetes. The aim of this manuscript is to 
review the association between oral antidiabetic drugs and AAA incidence and 
growth.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus databases 
until December 2019 to identify publications reporting on the association 
between oral antidiabetic drugs (biguanides/metformin, sulfonylureas(SU), 
thiazolidinediones(TZD), dipeptidyl-peptidase 4(DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like 
peptide 1(GLP-1) agonists, sodium-glucose transporter protein-2(SGLT2) 
inhibitors) and the outcomes AAA incidence and growth. Only data from human 
studies were considered, with a minimum of 3 months follow-up.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Six studies enrolling 25,810 patients were included: one 
reporting on the AAA risk and five reporting on AAA growth. Metformin 
prescription was associated with a 28% reduction in AAA occurrence, while SU and 
TZD were associated with a 18% decrease in AAA risk. Regarding AAA enlargement, 
results were concordant for a slower expansion rate associated with metformin, 
with a decrease ranging from -0.30 mm/y to -1.30 mm/y, but not consistent for 
other antidiabetic drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin seems to be associated with a decrease in AAA risk and 
enlargement rate. Evidence for the other classes is lacking. Studies evaluating 
the association between oral antidiabetic drugs and AAA progression, 
independently of the diabetic status, are needed.
