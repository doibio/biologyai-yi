PURPOSE: The bile salt export pump (BSEP), a key player in hepatic bile acid 
clearance, has been the center of research on drug-induced cholestasis. However, 
such studies focus primarily on the direct inhibition of BSEP, often overlooking 
the potential impact of transcriptional repression. This work aims to explore 
the disruption of bile acid efflux caused by drug-induced BSEP repression.
METHODS: BSEP activity was analyzed in human primary hepatocytes (HPH) using a 
traditional biliary-clearance experiment and a modified efflux assay, which 
includes a 72-h pretreatment prior to efflux measurement. Relative mRNA and 
protein expressions were examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.
RESULTS: Metformin concentration-dependently repressed BSEP expression in HPH. 
Although metformin did not directly inhibit BSEP activity, longer metformin 
exposure reduced BSEP transport function in HPH by down-regulating BSEP 
expression. BSEP repression by metformin was found to be AMP-activated protein 
kinase-independent. Additional screening of 10 reported cholestatic non-BSEP 
inhibitors revealed that the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen also markedly repressed 
BSEP expression and reduced BSEP activity in HPH.
CONCLUSIONS: Repression of BSEP alone is sufficient to disrupt hepatic bile acid 
efflux. Metformin and tamoxifen appear to be prototypes of a class of BSEP 
repressors that may cause drug-induced cholestasis through gene repression 
instead of direct BSEP inhibition.
