BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem. HCC burden 
has been increasing in Egypt in the past 10 years. Most HCC cases are diagnosed 
at an advanced stage with limited treatment options. Sorafenib is the standard 
therapy for advanced HCC, but the effectiveness is not satisfied. Metformin may 
decrease the risk of HCC development in diabetic patients, reduces tumor 
invasion, and augments sensitivity to sorafenib; however, safety and efficacy of 
combined treatment are still unclear. As HCC is characterized by high 
vascularity, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important 
role in vascularization, many studies questioned if VEGF and HIF-1 α could offer 
information about HCC response to sorafenib. We conducted this study to assess 
the benefits from adding metformin to HCC treatment, and appraise the role of 
VEGF and HIF-1 α in HCC prognosis.
METHOD: This was a prospective, randomized study in which 80 advanced measurable 
patients consecutively treated with sorafenib plus metformin (arm A) or 
sorafenib alone (arm B), prognostic value of plasma, and tissue levels of VEGF 
and HIF-1 α were evaluated.
RESULTS: We enrolled 61 men and 19 women with a median age of 60 years (range 
49-68 years). Fifty-seven patients had Child-Pugh A while 23 had early B, the 
most common etiology of liver disease was hepatitis C (86%). Sixty percent of 
patients were diabetic. No significant difference was detected between arm A and 
arm B regarding response to treatment (p = 0.5), time to disease progression 
(p = 0.3), or overall survival (p = 0.6). Low VEGF and HIF-1 α plasma levels 
were significantly associated with better treatment response (p < 0.001 for 
both), and higher OS (p < 0.001). Patients with high expressions of VEGF and HIF 
in HCC tissue had significantly poor treatment outcome (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, 
respectively), and poor OS (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: No superior efficacy of adding metformin to sorafenib in HCC 
treatment. VEGF and HIF-1 α had promising prognostic value in HCC.
