AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 
(SGLT2) inhibitors and metformin in adults with type1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
METHODS: Randomized clinical trials until February 2019, designed to assess the 
efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors/metformin in adults with T1DM, were 
searched on PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Safety and 
efficacy data were synthesized using Bayesian network meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Twenty eligible studies with 5868 participants were included in network 
meta-analysis. SGLT2 inhibitors provided greater reductions in HbA1c than 
placebo (weighted mean difference [WMD] -0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
-0.47, -0.32) and metformin (WMD: -0.32; 95%CI: -0.47, -0.14). Both SGLT2 
inhibitors and metformin promoted greater reductions in body weight than 
placebo. SGLT2 inhibitors caused greater reductions in body weight than 
metformin (WMD: -1.54; 95%CI: -2.93, -0.09). Both SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin 
provided greater reductions in total insulin dose than placebo, while no 
difference between metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors was found. No difference in 
severe hypoglycemia was found between SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin. SGLT2 
inhibitors induced a higher risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) than 
metformin/placebo.
CONCLUSION: SGLT2 inhibitors provided greater reductions in HbA1c and body 
weight than metformin/placebo. Both SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin induced 
greater reductions in total insulin dosage than placebo, with no significant 
differences observed between SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin. SGLT2 inhibitors 
induced a higher risk for DKA than metformin/placebo.
