BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to compare glycaemic control with insulin 
detemir administered according to two titration algorithms (3-0-3 and 2-4-6-8) 
after 20 weeks of treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
inadequately controlled on metformin.
METHODS: This was a 20-week, randomised, multicentre, open-labelled, 
treat-to-target trial. Forty-six patients were randomised in a 1:1 manner to 
either the 3-0-3 (G3, n=23) or 2-4-6-8 (G2, n=23) algorithm. The primary 
endpoint was change of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and the secondary safety 
endpoint included hypoglycaemic events.
RESULTS: After 20 weeks, HbA1c decreased similarly in the G3 and G2 groups, with 
a mean change of -0.9% from baseline. The mean change in fasting plasma glucose 
was numerically similar in both groups. The hypoglycaemia event rate per 
100-patient-years of exposure (r) in the G2 group (r=1,427) was higher than that 
in the G3 group (r=807).
CONCLUSION: Both treatment groups had numerically similar HbA1c reductions. A 
trend towards fewer hypoglycaemia episodes after dose stabilisation was seen 
with the simpler G3. Clinically, this may be an important observation, as a 
simpler titration algorithm may support self-management and maintenance of 
insulin therapy.
