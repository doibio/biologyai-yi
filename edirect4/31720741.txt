We investigated the role of autophagy, a controlled lysosomal degradation of 
cellular macromolecules and organelles, in glutamate excitotoxicity during 
nutrient deprivation in vitro. The incubation in low-glucose serum/amino 
acid-free cell culture medium synergized with glutamate in increasing AMP/ATP 
ratio and causing excitotoxic necrosis in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. 
Glutamate suppressed starvation-triggered autophagy, as confirmed by diminished 
intracellular acidification, lower LC3 punctuation and LC3-I conversion to 
autophagosome-associated LC3-II, reduced expression of proautophagic beclin-1 
and ATG5, increase of the selective autophagic target NBR1, and decreased number 
of autophagic vesicles. Similar results were observed in PC12 rat 
pheochromocytoma cells. Both glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity and autophagy 
inhibition in starved SH-SY5Y cells were reverted by NMDA antagonist memantine 
and mimicked by NMDA agonists D-aspartate and ibotenate. Glutamate reduced 
starvation-triggered phosphorylation of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) without affecting the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin 
complex 1, a major negative regulator of autophagy. This was associated with 
reduced mRNA levels of autophagy transcriptional activators (FOXO3, ATF4) and 
molecules involved in autophagy initiation (ULK1, ATG13, FIP200), autophagosome 
nucleation/elongation (ATG14, beclin-1, ATG5), and autophagic cargo delivery to 
autophagosomes (SQSTM1). Glutamate-mediated transcriptional repression of 
autophagy was alleviated by overexpression of constitutively active AMPK. 
Genetic or pharmacological AMPK activation by AMPK overexpression or metformin, 
as well as genetic or pharmacological autophagy induction by TFEB overexpression 
or lithium chloride, reduced the sensitivity of nutrient-deprived SH-SY5Y cells 
to glutamate excitotoxicity. These data indicate that transcriptional inhibition 
of AMPK-dependent cytoprotective autophagy is involved in glutamate-mediated 
excitotoxicity during nutrient deprivation in vitro.
