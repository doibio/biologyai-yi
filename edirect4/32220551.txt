AIMS: To determine the early benefit:risk balance of dulaglutide versus insulin 
glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: This post hoc analysis used data from a randomized, open-label study 
(AWARD-2; modified intention-to-treat group) in which suboptimally controlled 
metformin + glimepiride-treated patients received dulaglutide 1.5 mg (n = 273) 
or insulin glargine (n = 262). Two composite endpoints were used: for weeks 
2-20, fasting serum glucose (FSG) <130 mg/dL (<7.2 mmol/L) without hypoglycemia 
(blood glucose ≤70 mg/dL [≤3.9 mmol/L] or severe hypoglycemia); at week 26, 
patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) <7.0% (<53.0 mmol/mol) or reduction 
from baseline ≥1.0% (≥10.9 mmol/mol), no hypoglycemia (as defined above) and no 
weight gain. Odds ratios (ORs) were generated using logistic regression 
analysis.
RESULTS: The probability of reaching the FSG target without hypoglycemia was 
higher with dulaglutide than with insulin glargine at weeks 4 (OR 1.78; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.22-2.60) and 8 (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.15-2.48). The 
proportion of patients achieving the 26-week endpoint was higher with 
dulaglutide (37.4% vs. 10.3%; OR 5.28; 95% CI 3.28-8.48).
CONCLUSIONS: Dulaglutide's balanced efficacy-to-safety profile compares 
favorably with that of insulin glargine and is apparent soon after treatment 
initiation and after 6 months of therapy.
