OBJECTIVE: To compare diabetic kidney disease (DKD) rates over 5 years of 
follow-up in two cohorts of severely obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) undergoing medical or surgical treatment for T2D.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of data 
collected from obese participants of similar age and racial distribution 
enrolled in the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) 
and the Treatment Options of Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) 
studies. Teen-LABS participants underwent metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS). 
TODAY participants were randomized to metformin alone or in combination with 
rosiglitazone or intensive lifestyle intervention, with insulin therapy given 
for glycemic progression. Glycemic control, BMI, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR), urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and prevalence of hyperfiltration 
(eGFR ≥135 mL/min/1.73 m2) and elevated UAE (≥30 mg/g) were assessed annually.
RESULTS: Participants with T2D from Teen-LABS (n = 30, mean ± SD age, 16.9 ± 1.3 
years; 70% female; 60% white; BMI 54.4 ± 9.5 kg/m2) and TODAY (n = 63, age 15.3 
± 1.3 years; 56% female; 71% white; BMI 40.5 ± 4.9 kg/m2) were compared. During 
5 years of follow-up, hyperfiltration decreased from 21% to 18% in Teen-LABS and 
increased from 7% to 48% in TODAY. Elevated UAE decreased from 27% to 5% in 
Teen-LABS and increased from 21% to 43% in TODAY. Adjusting for baseline age, 
sex, BMI, and HbA1c, TODAY participants had a greater odds of hyperfiltration 
(odds ratio 15.7 [95% CI 2.6, 94.3]) and elevated UAE (27.3 [4.9, 149.9]) at 5 
years of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with MBS, medical treatment of obese youth with T2D was 
associated with a higher odds of DKD over 5 years.
