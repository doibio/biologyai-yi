INTRODUCTION: Here, we aimed to investigate whether the beneficial effects of 
metformin on lipid accumulation is mediated through regulation of miR-33b.
METHODS: The expression of the genes and miRNAs and protein levels were 
evaluated using real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. To investigate the 
potential role of miR-33b in lipid accumulation, the mimic of the miR-33b was 
transfected into HepG2 cells.
RESULTS: We found that metformin reduces high glucose-induced lipid accumulation 
in HepG2 cells through inhibiting of SREBP1c and FAS and increasing the 
expression of CPT1 and CROT. Overexpression of miR-33b significantly prevented 
the decreasing effect of metformin on lipid content and intra and extra 
triglyceride levels. Importantly, miR-33b mimic inhibited the increasing effects 
of metformin on the expression of CPT1 and CROT.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that metformin attenuates high 
glucose-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cell by downregulating the 
expression of miR-33b.
