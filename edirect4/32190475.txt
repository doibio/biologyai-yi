Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) can often be life threatening and 
requires timely diagnosis and prompt initiation of plasmapharesis. Cobalamin 
deficiency can closely mimic TTP and distinguishing between the two diseases can 
prove to be a diagnostic challenge. Previously, cobalamin-related pseudo-TTP has 
been associated with pernicious anemia, dietary insufficiency and hereditary 
disorders of cobalamin activation. Here in, we discuss the first case of 
suspected metformin-induced cobalamin deficiency causing pseudo-TTP. Our patient 
was a 36-year-old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus on metformin for eight 
years who presented with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, schistocytes and 
mild acute renal failure. The initial impression was TTP; however, further 
workup revealed very low serum cobalamin levels and elevated methylmalonic acid 
levels. Apart from metformin use, no other cause of cobalamin deficiency was 
identified. We recommended upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to definitively rule 
out pernicious anemia.
