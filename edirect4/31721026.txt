BACKGROUND: Metformin is the most widely used oral antihyperglycemic agent for 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite the possible benefits of 
metformin on diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF), acute or unstable HF 
remains a precaution for its use.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present prospective randomized controlled trial was to 
assess whether metformin treatment has beneficial effects on patients with T2DM 
with hypertension without overt HF.
METHODS: A total of 164 patients (92 males, 72 females; median age 66 years) 
were included in this study. Patients with T2DM with a history of hypertension 
were randomized 1:1 to treatment for 1 year with either metformin 
(metformin-treated group) or other hypoglycemic agents (control group). The 
primary endpoints were changes in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, left 
ventricular (LV) mass index, and indicators of LV diastolic function. We also 
evaluated changes in both clinical findings and blood laboratory examination 
data.
RESULTS: We observed no significant changes between baseline and 1-year 
post-treatment in LV mass index, BNP levels, or E/e' (early diastolic 
transmitral flow velocity/early diastolic mitral annular velocity; an indicator 
of LV diastolic function) in either the metformin-treated (n = 83) or the 
control (n = 81) groups. The metformin-treated group had a significant reduction 
of body mass index (BMI) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), but 
the control group did not. We determined that renal function, including serum 
creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, deteriorated significantly 
in the control group but not in the metformin-treated group.
CONCLUSION: LV mass and diastolic function were not affected after 1 year of 
metformin treatment in patients with T2DM. However, we observed benefits in 
terms of reductions in both BMI and LDL-C levels and preservation of renal 
function.
