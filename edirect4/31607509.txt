INTRODUCTION: The elderly diabetes prevalence is greater than 20%. Drug 
hypoglycemia prevention is the key point in elderly diabetes therapeutic 
management. Today, there is no better drug to add to metformin in elderly 
uncontrolled diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review established the different 
hypoglycemic events and their occurrence probability. After determining the 
various procedures costs in the hypoglycemic events management and associated 
treatments costs, the cost of each type of hypoglycemic event (mild, moderate 
and severe) was calculated and the average cost of an hypoglycemic event (all 
intensities combined) was deduced. In order to determine the most appropriate 
drug association in the 80+age group, a cost-utility study was conducted using 
the quality adjusted life years (QALY) determination of each strategy.
RESULTS: The lower hypoglycemic strategies are metformine+DPP-4 inhibitor and 
metformin+GLP-1 analogs. Following the calculation of the different ICERs, the 
most economically and clinically advantageous drug combination is: 
metformin+DPP-4 inhibitor. DISCUSSION - CONCLUSION: Based on this study, the 
drug combination metformin+DPP-4 inhibitor would be the better therapy in 
elderly diabetic patient. However, this result needs to be adapted individually.
