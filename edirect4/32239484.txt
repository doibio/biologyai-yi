AIM: To investigate the effects of metformin, a drug used widely for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, on human primary cell cultures prepared 
from uninjured segment of disc material intervertebral disk tissues.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Primary cell cultures were prepared using the tissues of 
six patients (three males and three females) who had undergone lumbar 
microdiscectomy and sequestrectomy. Untreated samples served as the control 
group, and metformintreated samples served as the experimental group. All the 
samples were evaluated using an inverted light microscope, acridine 
orange/propidium iodide staining (AO/PI), and a fluorescence microscope. The 
cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of metformin, which was administered to the 
samples using a commercial MTT assay kit, were also evaluated. The data obtained 
were statistically assessed, and the alpha significance value was accepted as 
less than 0.05. In addition, for the groupsâ€™ changes in the expressions of 
chondroadherin (CHAD), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), 
interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7), and matrix 
metalloproteinase 19 (MMP-19), genes related to the extracellular matrix 
synthesis and degradation were determined using gene-specific TaqMan Gene 
Expression Assays.
RESULTS: The administration of the drug adversely affected nucleus pulposus 
(NP)/annulus fibrosus (AF) cells and extracellular matrixâ€"like structures. 
This was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Clinicians should not disregard the adverse effects of metformin, 
which is used widely in clinical practice, on the components of intervertebral 
disk tissues.
