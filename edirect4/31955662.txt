BACKGROUND: Studies have shown an association between metformin use and vitamin 
B12 deficiency. Since 2017, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of 
Medical Care in Diabetes Guideline has included a recommendation for periodic 
vitamin B12 measurements in metformin-treated patients, especially those with 
anemia or peripheral neuropathy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the overall incidence and impact of the ADA Guideline on 
vitamin B12 monitoring in a veteran population on long-term metformin therapy.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed for patients on metformin who 
started therapy prior to 2005 at the VA North Texas Health Care System 
(VANTXHCS). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with at least 1 
vitamin B12 level drawn during 2016 versus 2018. Metformin dose and duration, 
vitamin B12 supplementation, and incident neuropathy prescriptions or diagnosis 
were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 394 patients included for the primary outcome, 136 (34.5%) had at 
least 1 vitamin B12 level in 2016 versus 198 (50.3%) patients in 2018 (odds 
ratio: 1.94, P < .001). Of the 394 patients, 157 were diagnosed with neuropathy 
or prescribed a medication for neuropathy without a vitamin B12 level in the 
previous year or with a low level that was not supplemented.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin B12 monitoring significantly increased between 2016 and 
2018, aligning with the release of the 2017 ADA guidelines. However, a large 
proportion of patients were identified who were diagnosed with or treated for 
neuropathy without adequate vitamin B12 monitoring.
