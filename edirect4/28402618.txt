In the early 1990’s, clinicians’ choices for pharmacological management of type 
2 diabetes were limited to insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin. Since then, 
multiple classes of agents have been discovered, approved, and put into clinical 
use. Through a series of cardiovascular outcome trials and other clinical 
trials, some classes of agents have been found to have benefits on 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic 
kidney disease, sometimes independent of glycemic control. As a result, diabetes 
management has shifted away from a “one size fits all” care to an individualized 
approach for each patient. Important factors to consider include efficacy, cost, 
side effects, adherence and treatment burden, comorbidities, mechanisms of 
action, and non-glycemic effects on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 
congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. The goal of this chapter 
is to discuss an approach to pharmacological management that reviews current 
guidelines, discusses choosing appropriate glycemic targets, and presents the 
rationale for choosing certain medications in different situations. For complete
