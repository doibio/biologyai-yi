Dry eyes may be caused by impairment in the tear production or excessive tear 
evaporation and are associated with photophobia, red eyes, vision impairment, 
local pain and pruritus. It has been described that patients with Diabetes 
Mellitus (DM) may have a higher prevalence of dry eyes than normal population. 
This is a case control study of 120 patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and 120 
paired controls aiming to compare their prevalence of dry eyes (by the Schirmer 
test) and its severity (measured by OSDI or Ocular Surface Disease Index) as 
well as their association with diseases' clinical variables. We found that 38.3% 
of DM patients had dry eyes, a prevalence that was higher than controls (p = 
0.02). At univariate analysis, they were found to be more common in older 
individuals (p = 0.001) with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.001) and in those using 
metformin (p = 0.001). A multivariate linear regression showed that metformin 
use was the only independent variable associated with dry eyes. When patients 
with dry eyes with and without DM were compared, no differences in the symptom's 
intensity were found.
