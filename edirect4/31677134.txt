BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and sodium-glucose 
co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are widely used antidiabetic drugs. However, 
to date, no studies have directly compared the effects of these two drugs on the 
components of the metabolic syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM).
OBJECTIVES: The Comparison of Canagliflozin vs. Teneligliptin against Basic 
Metabolic Risks in Patients with T2DM (CANTABILE) study aims to examine whether 
the DPP-4 inhibitor (teneligliptin) or the SGLT2 inhibitor (canagliflozin) is 
the more effective drug for reducing metabolic risk factors as a composite in 
Japanese patients with T2DM.
METHODS: The CANTABILE study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, 
randomized, parallel-group comparison study. A total of 200 patients with T2DM 
treated with metformin alone or without glucose-lowering agents will be enrolled 
if they have one or more of the metabolic risk factors, such as obesity, 
borderline high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. They will then will be 
randomized into the Teneligliptin group or the Canagliflozin group and treated 
for 24Â weeks. The primary endpoint is the composite ratio of subjects with one 
or more improved metabolic risk factors. The secondary endpoints are the changes 
in each component of the primary endpoint.
PLANNED OUTCOMES: The CANTABILE study provides valuable evidence to indicate the 
suitability of SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors for Japanese patients with 
T2DM and metabolic risks.
