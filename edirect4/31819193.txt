BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies suggest that metformin may reduce the 
incidence of cancer in patients with diabetes and multiple late phase clinical 
trials assessing the potential of repurposing this drug are underway. 
Transcriptomic profiling of tumour samples is an excellent tool to understand 
drug bioactivity, identify candidate biomarkers and assess for mechanisms of 
resistance to therapy.
METHODS: Thirty-six patients with untreated primary breast cancer were recruited 
to a window study and transcriptomic profiling of tumour samples carried out 
before and after metformin treatment.
RESULTS: Multiple genes that regulate fatty acid oxidation were upregulated at 
the transcriptomic level and there was a differential change in expression 
between two previously identified cohorts of patients with distinct metabolic 
responses. Increase in expression of a mitochondrial fatty oxidation gene 
composite signature correlated with change in a proliferation gene signature. In 
vitro assays showed that, in contrast to previous studies in models of normal 
cells, metformin reduces fatty acid oxidation with a subsequent accumulation of 
intracellular triglyceride, independent of AMPK activation.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that metformin at clinical doses targets fatty acid 
oxidation in cancer cells with implications for patient selection and drug 
combinations.
