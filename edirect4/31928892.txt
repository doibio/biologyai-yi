AIMS: The effects of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) medications on secondary 
prevention after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remain unclear. We evaluated 
recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) after primary diagnosis of ACS in T2DM 
patients.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 569 patients with newly 
diagnosed ACS from 2007 to 2012. The endpoint was recurrent CVD up to a 
five-year maximum follow-up until 2016. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox 
proportional hazard regressions were performed to examine the association 
between T2DM diagnosis, different antidiabetic drugs, and recurrent CVD.
RESULTS: Among 569 patients, 198 had T2DM. The mean follow-up was 1540 
(interquartile range, 864-2157) days. Patients with diabetes showed higher risk 
of recurrent cardiovascular event compared with those without (P = 0.004). 
Patients with diabetes treated with metformin (65 patients) showed longer 
event-free survival, compared with those on other antidiabetic medications 
(P = 0.005). Multivariable analysis confirmed a reduced risk of recurrent CVD 
associated with metformin (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 
0.12-0.91), while lower hemoglobin A1c levels on admission were not associated 
with better CVD outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: T2DM increases risk of recurrent CVD after first ACS episode 
regardless of glycemic control on admission, while use of metformin may reduce 
recurrence.
