OBJECTIVE: This study was to analyze the efficacy of metformin intervention in 
preventing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials or 
observational studies of metformin intervention in preventing symptoms of GDM 
during pregnancy were performed. Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were 
searched through to now. The main evaluated primary outcomes were incident of 
GDM, miscarriage, preterm delivery, and neonatal mortality. The evaluated 
secondary outcomes were mean difference of gestational age at birth and birth 
weight between metformin group and control group.
RESULTS: We included 6 studies including 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs), 2 
observational studies, and 1 non-RCT in our meta-analysis. A total of 643 
patients were enrolled for a follow-up study with continued metformin therapy 
(n=341) or not (n=302) during pregnancy. Metformin therapy reduced the 
proportion of patients developing GDM (log Odds Ratio: -1.27; 95%CI: -2.24 to 
-0.30) but had no significant effect on reducing the proportion of abortion, 
preterm delivery, and neonatal death in pregnant women with polycystic ovary 
syndrome (PCOS). Also, it did not cause a significant difference in gestational 
age at birth and birth weight in metformin group versus control/placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin was associated with less frequent GDM development than 
control diets, suggesting that it is the appropriate intervention to be 
prescribed to prevent GDM in patients with PCOS.
