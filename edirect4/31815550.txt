OBJECTIVE: The pattern of urinary excretion of total sulphated 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and their particular types: chondroitin 
sulphate/dermatan sulphate (CS/DS) and heparan sulphate (HS) was analysed in 
obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with metformin in 
monotherapy for the period of six months.
METHODS: The urinary sulphated glycosaminoglycans were quantitated using 
standardised dye (1.9-dimethylmethylene blue)-binding method and normalised to 
creatinine level.
RESULTS: Urinary total GAGs, CS/DS and HS levels were significantly higher in 
untreated diabetic patients in comparison to healthy subjects. Moreover, it was 
observed that urinary total GAGs, CS/DS and HS levels in diabetic patients after 
six-month metformin therapy were significantly decreased versus pre-treatment 
situation.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results suggest that the six-month treatment with 
metformin in obese patients with T2DM has a regulating influence on the systemic 
changes in proteoglycans/glycosaminoglycans, resulting in a decrease in the 
urinary excretion of total GAGs, CS/DS and HS.
