OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness estimates are useful to a health plan when they 
are specific to a utilization management policy question. To help inform a step 
therapy policy decision, this study assessed the 3-year cost-effectiveness of 
adding a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor versus switching to a 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in patients with type 2 
diabetes who are on metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor 
from both private and public payer perspectives in the United States.
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was built incorporating goal glycated 
hemoglobin (A1C) achievement as the effectiveness measure, as well as adverse 
effect and discontinuation rates from clinical trial data. One-way, scenario, 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 1000 patients, adding an SGLT2 inhibitor led to $3.9 
million more in spending and 93 more patients reaching goal A1C compared with 
switching from a DPP-4 inhibitor to a GLP-1 RA. This resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $42,125Â per patient to achieve goal A1C from 
the private payer perspective. Using a public payer perspective led to an ICER 
of $103,829. These results were most sensitive to changes in drug costs and the 
proportion of patients achieving A1C goal or discontinuing.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming a $50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold, adding an SGLT2 
inhibitor was cost-effective compared with switching from a DPP-4 inhibitor to a 
GLP-1 RA from a private payer perspective but not from a public payer 
perspective. This study highlights how differences in payer reimbursement rates 
for medications can lead to contrasting results.
