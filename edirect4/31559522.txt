Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease involving periodontal tissues. 
Periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) play an important role in the regeneration of 
periodontal tissue. However, senescent PDLCs have an impeded regenerative 
potential. Metformin has been reported to prevent senescence at both the 
cellular and individual levels. The objectives of the present study were to 
evaluate the effects of metformin on cellular senescence in human PDLCs (hPDLCs) 
under oxidative stress. hPDLCs were pretreated with metformin, followed by H2O2 
exposure. The cell viability, oxidative damage, cellular senescence and 
osteogenic potential were detected. To inhibit autophagy, hPDLCs were treated 
with 3-methyladenine before metformin treatment. The present study revealed that 
H2O2 exposure inhibits proliferation, increased lysosomal Î²-galactosidase 
activity, augments reactive oxidative species (ROS) accumulation, elevates the 
oxidative damage, stimulates the expression of senescence-related genes and 
impedes the activity of the osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs. Metformin 
pretreatment could partly reverse the detrimental influences of H2O2 on hPDLCs. 
Moreover, metformin could stimulate autophagy, whereas the inhibition of 
autophagy with 3-methyladenine reversed the anti-senescence effects of metformin 
on hPDLCs under oxidative stress. The present study manifested that metformin 
could alleviate oxidative stress-induced senescence via stimulating autophagy 
and could partially recover the osteogenic potential of hPDLCs, possibly 
providing a reference for the discovery of periodontal treatment from the 
perspective of antisenescence.
