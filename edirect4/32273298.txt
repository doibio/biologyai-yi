We sought to examine the progression from abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 
diagnosis to surgery and death among diabetics with and without exposure to 
metformin as well as non-diabetics. We conducted a retrospective cohort study 
(January 2000 to July 2019) comparing 3 transitions (AAA surgery, death, and 
death after AAA surgery) among propensity score-matched metformin-exposed and 
unexposed diabetic veterans and non-diabetic veterans using the VA Informatics 
and Computing Infrastructure database. We fit an adjusted Cox proportional 
hazards model with transition-specific effects. There were 43,073 
metformin-unexposed diabetics, 24,361 metformin-exposed diabetics and 56,006 
non-diabetics. Compared with the non-diabetic cohort, both diabetic cohorts have 
a lower risk of surgery (no metformin (HR=0.740, 95% CI 0.706 to 0.776); with 
metformin (HR=0.770, 95% CI 0.730 to 0.813)). However, the non-metformin 
diabetic cohort has a higher risk of death (HR=1.024, 95% CI 1.004 to 1.045) and 
death after surgery (HR=1.086, 95% CI 1.013 to 1.165). The metformin-exposed 
diabetic cohort has a lower risk of death in the first 10 years after AAA 
diagnosis (HR=0.877, 95% CI 0.855 to 0.899), yet a higher risk of death 10 years 
after AAA diagnosis (HR=1.177, 95% CI 1.092 to 1.270) compared with non-diabetic 
cohort. Non-diabetics have the highest rate of AAA surgery compared with both 
diabetic cohorts. However, diabetics without metformin have the highest risk of 
death prior to, and after surgery. This research provides novel findings for 
patients diagnosed with AAA. The use of metformin after both AAA diagnosis and 
surgery should be further investigated.
