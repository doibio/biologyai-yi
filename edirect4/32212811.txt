INTRODUCTION: Association of diabetes mellitus (DM) with head and neck cancers 
(HNC) is still controversial. In some studies, diabetic patients had an 
increased risk of cancer at some HNC subsites like oral cancer, while in other 
studies this risk was decreased. So, the present study aims to evaluate the 
association of diabetes mellitus, oral cancer with and without metformin and the 
role of habits in association with DM and metformin in the etiology of oral 
cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was undertaken in the Kamineni Institute of 
Dental Sciences in collaboration with MNJ Institute of Oncology and Regional 
Cancer Centre, Hyderabad. The study includes 2 main groups, they are 500 Oral 
cancer patients and Control group includes 500 age and gender-matched patients 
with habits without any oral precancerous lesion/conditions. Odds ratios (OR) 
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: Out of 1000 subjects inverse relation of DM with oral cancer was 
observed. On comparison between oral cancer, diabetes and habits in study group 
and control group, decreased risk was observed with smokers (OR: 1.131and 95%CI: 
0.68 -1.86) and non-chewers (OR: 2.43 and 95% CI: 1.31 - 4.49) and 
non-alcoholics (OR: 1.78 and 95% C.I:1.18 - 2.68). Metformin use among diabetic 
participants was associated with a decreased risk of oral cancer (OR: 0.51 and 
95% C.I: 0.33 - 0.77). A negative association was observed in smokers (OR: 0.19 
and 95% C.I.: 0.078 - 0.459), non-chewers (OR: 0.24 and 95% C.I : 0.11- 0.53) 
and non-alcoholics (OR: 0.46 and 95% C.I. : 0.29 - 0.727).
CONCLUSION: Thus the present population based study results suggest an inverse 
association of DM and oral cancer with metformin and negative association of 
habits with DM and Metformin in etiology of oral cancer.
