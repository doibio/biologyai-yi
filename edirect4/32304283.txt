AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To assess the efficacy and safety of 
metformin/sitagliptin-based dual/triple therapy in elderly Chinese patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This subgroup analysis included individuals aged 
≥65 years from the STRATEGY study, a two-stage study in which type 2 diabetes 
mellitus patients with unsatisfactory glycemic control on metformin were first 
treated with the dual combination of metformin and sitagliptin for 16 weeks 
(n = 681), and then, if glycemic control had not been achieved, were treated 
with a third add-on oral antihyperglycemic drug for another 24 weeks (n = 291). 
The efficacy end-point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in each stage, 
and the safety end-point was adverse events with a focus on hypoglycemia.
RESULTS: At week 16, the change in HbA1c was -0.81% from baseline, and the 
percentages of patients who achieved HbA1c targets of <7% and <7.5% were 44.9 
and 67.2%, respectively. After 24 weeks, a further average HbA1c reduction of 
-0.60% was observed with specific reductions of -0.70% with glimepiride, -0.63% 
with gliclazide, -0.51% with repaglinide and -0.45% with acarbose. The 
proportions of patients who achieved HbA1c targets of <7% and <7.5% were 65.4 
and 81.3%, respectively, over the entire study. The rates of drug-related 
adverse events and hypoglycemia were, respectively, 4.1 and 4.3% in the dual 
therapy stage, and 5.2% and 7.1% in the triple therapy stage, without occurrence 
of severe hypoglycemia.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, 
metformin/sitagliptin-based dual and triple oral therapy can provide clinically 
meaningful glycemic control and is generally well tolerated with a low incidence 
of hypoglycemia.
