Background In the United States, 18.5% of children are obese. Dietary and 
lifestyle modifications are key, but often ineffective. There are limited 
approved pediatric pharmacotherapies. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate current treatment practices for pediatric obesity among members of the 
Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES, n = 1300) and the Pediatric Obesity Weight 
Evaluation Registry (POWER, n = 42) consortium. Methods A 10-question online 
survey on treatment of children with obesity in clinical practice was conducted. 
Results The response rates were 19% for PES and 20% for POWER members. The 
majority were female (65%) and board certified in pediatric endocrinology (81%). 
Most practitioners saw 5-10 patients with obesity/week and 19% prescribed 
weight-loss medications. POWER participants were more likely to prescribe 
weight-loss medications than PES participants (46% vs. 18%, p =  0.02). 
Metformin was the most commonly prescribed medication. Response to medication 
was poor. Use of dietary non-pharmacological treatment options was uncommon. 
Over half of the respondents (56%) referred patients for bariatric surgery and 
53% had local access to pediatric bariatric surgery. Conclusions Metformin was 
the most common drug prescribed among respondents, but successful weight-loss 
responses were uncommon. Among practitioners who are using pharmacological 
interventions, therapeutic strategies vary widely. Targeted research in 
pharmacologic and surgical treatment for pediatric obesity is urgently needed.
