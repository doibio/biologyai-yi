Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), as a common endocrine disorder is accompanied 
by hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, ovulation problems, and infertility. 
Various types of off-label drugs like metformin have been used for the 
management of targeted problems caused by PCOS such as insulin resistance and 
hyperandrogenism. Nicotinamide (NAM) acts as a substrate of visfatin and 
Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase (NNMT) leading to the generation of 
Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) and N1-Methylnicotinamide (MNAM), 
respectively. MNAM is known as an anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombosis, and 
anti-diabetic agent. In this study, the effects of NAM and MNAM on metabolic and 
endocrine abnormalities were evaluated in the adipose and ovarian tissues of a 
letrozole-induced rat model of PCOS. Our results showed that MNAM and NAM 
reversed abnormal estrous cycle and reduced the serum testosterone levels and 
CYP17A1 gene expression. Furthermore, all therapeutic factors improved HOMA-IR 
after treatment and NAM significantly increased the expression of GLUT4 and 
decreased the gene expression of visfatin. Also, MNAM diminished the gene 
expression of visfatin and resistin. It is noteworthy that all the therapeutic 
factors successfully activated the AMPK. In summary, this study is the first 
study reported beneficial effects of NAM and MNAM on the treatment of PCOS. 
Additionally, the alleviative effects of our therapeutic factors may be 
partially mediated by the AMPK-dependent manner due to the contribution of the 
AMPK in the expression of CYP17A1, visfatin, resistin, and GLUT4. Although more 
studies are required to unravel the exact mode of actions of MNAM and NAM in the 
PCOS, the findings of the current study shed light on an urgent need for 
discovering novel therapeutic pharmaceuticals regarding the treatment of PCOS.
