BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In routine clinical practice, early discontinuation of 
newly initiated glucose-lowering medications (GLM) is relatively common. We 
herein evaluated if the clinical characteristics associated with early 
discontinuation of dapagliflozin were different from those associated with early 
discontinuation of other GLM.
METHODS: The DARWIN-T2D was a multicenter retrospective study conducted at 
diabetes specialist outpatient clinics in Italy. We included 2484 patients who 
were initiated on dapagliflozin in 2015-2016 and 14,801 patients who were 
initiated on other GLM (DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or 
gliclazide) in the same period. After excluding patients who had not (yet) 
returned to follow-up, we compared the characteristics of patients who persisted 
on drug versus those who were no longer on drug at the first available follow-up 
after at least 3Â months.
RESULTS: As compared to those who persisted on drug, patients who discontinued 
dapagliflozin (51.7%) were more often female, had higher baseline fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG), HbA1c, and eGFR, and less common use of metformin. Upon multiple 
regression, higher HbA1c, higher eGFR, and lower metformin use remained 
independently associated with early discontinuation. Among patients who had been 
initiated on other GLM, 41.7% discontinued. Variables independently associated 
with discontinuation were older age, longer diabetes duration, higher HbA1c, 
eGFR, and albumin excretion, more common use of insulin and less metformin.
CONCLUSION: In routine clinical practice, all variables associated with 
dapagliflozin discontinuation were also associated with discontinuation of other 
GLM. Thus, despite a distinctive mechanism of action and a peculiar tolerability 
profile, no specific predictor of dapagliflozin discontinuation was detected.
