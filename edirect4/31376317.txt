Despite advances in sepsis management, it remains a major intensive-care-unit 
(ICU) concern. From new prospective, positive effects of metformin, such as 
anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are considered potentially 
beneficial properties for management of septic patients. This article reviewed 
the potential ameliorative effects of metformin in sepsis-induced organ failure. 
Information were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar. 
Multi-organ damage, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine stimulation, and 
altered circulation are hallmarks of sepsis. Metformin exerts its effect via 
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. It improves 
sepsis-induced organ failure by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, preventing the activation of 
transcription factors related to inflammation, decreasing neutrophil 
accumulation/infiltration, and also maintaining mitochondrial membrane 
potential. Studies reported the safety of metformin therapeutic doses, with no 
evidence of lactic acidosis, in septic patients.
