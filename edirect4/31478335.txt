The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
gemigliptin added to a stable dose of insulin alone or of insulin in combination 
with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. After a two-week 
run-in period, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive gemigliptin 50 mg or 
placebo once daily as add-on to background therapy with insulin or insulin plus 
metformin for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c) from baseline at Week 24. Baseline characteristics were similar between 
the gemigliptin (n = 188) and placebo (n = 95) groups in terms of HbA1c (8.1%). 
At Week 24, the gemigliptin group showed a statistically significant reduction 
in mean HbA1c from baseline as compared with placebo (between-group mean 
difference, -0.7% [95% CI, -0.9% to -0.4%]; P-value < 0.0001). The incidence of 
overall adverse events and the number of hypoglycaemic adverse events were 
similar between the study groups. Gemigliptin added to insulin alone or to 
insulin in combination with metformin resulted in superior glycaemic control 
compared to that in the placebo group and was well tolerated for 24 weeks in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, without causing weight gain or 
increasing the incidence of hypoglycaemia.
