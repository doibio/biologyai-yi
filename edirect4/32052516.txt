Efficacy and safety of dual add-on therapy with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin 
versus glimepiride in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes on a

AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin (DAPA) + saxagliptin 
(SAXA) compared with glimepiride (GLIM) in patients with type 2 diabetes who 
were inadequately controlled [glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.5-10.5% 
(58-91 mmol/mol)] on metformin monotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 52-week, multicentre, double-blind, 
active-controlled study (NCT02419612) randomized (1:1) patients on metformin to 
add-on DAPA 10 mg + SAXA 5 mg (n = 227) or GLIM 1-6 mg (titrated; n = 217). The 
primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 52.
RESULTS: Baseline mean ± standard deviation of age, duration of diabetes and 
HbA1c were 56.1 ± 9.7 years, 7.8 ± 6.4 years and 8.5% ± 0.8% 
(69 ± 9.0 mmol/mol), respectively. Adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c 
was -1.35% (-14.8 mmol/mol) with DAPA + SAXA versus -0.98% (-10.7 mmol/mol) with 
GLIM (P <0.001). Changes from baseline in body weight and systolic blood 
pressure were -3.1 kg and -2.6 mmHg with DAPA + SAXA versus +1.0 kg (P <0.001) 
and +1.0 mmHg (P = 0.007) with GLIM. More patients achieved HbA1c <7.0% 
(53 mmol/mol) (44.3% vs. 34.3%; P = 0.044), and fewer patients required 
treatment intensification (1.3% vs. 8.8%; P = 0.002) with DAPA + SAXA than with 
GLIM.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with GLIM, concurrent addition of DAPA + SAXA 
significantly improved glycaemic control, body weight and other metabolic 
parameters in patients inadequately controlled on metformin. Trial: NCT02419612, 
ClinicalTrials.gov.
