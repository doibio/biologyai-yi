Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channels are emerging 
therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders. Berberine, which is a modulator of 
TRPV1, has proven antiobesity and antidiabetic potentials. The present study was 
aimed to investigate the protective effects of berberine in olanzapine-induced 
alterations in hypothalamic appetite control, inflammation and metabolic 
aberrations in mice targeting TRPV1 channels. Female BALB/c mice (18-23 g) were 
treated with olanzapine (6 mg/kg, p.o.) for six weeks to induce metabolic 
alterations, while berberine (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) and metformin (100 mg/kg, 
p.o) were used as test and standard interventions respectively. Weekly 
assessment of feed-water intake, body temperature and body weight was done, 
while locomotion was measured at the end of week 1 and 6. Serum glucose and 
lipid profile were assessed by biochemical methods, while other serum biomarkers 
were assessed by ELISA. qPCR was used to quantify the mRNA expression in the 
hypothalamus. Olanzapine treatment significantly increased the feed intake, 
weight gain, adiposity index, while reduced body temperature and locomotor 
activity which were reversed by berberine treatment. Berberine treatment reduced 
serum ghrelin and leptin levels as well decrease in hypothalamic mRNA expression 
of orexigenic neuropeptides, inflammatory markers and ghrelin receptor in 
olanzapine-treated mice. Olanzapine treatment increased expression of 
TRPV1/TRPV3 in the hypothalamus which was significantly decreased by berberine 
treatment. Our results suggest that berberine, by TRPV1/TRPV3 modulation, 
attenuated the olanzapine-induced metabolic alterations in mice. Hence berberine 
supplementation in psychiatric patients could be a preventive approach to reduce 
the metabolic adverse effects of antipsychotics.
