AIM: Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin (DAPA + SAXA) were 
compared with insulin glargine (INS) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a 
52-week extension study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This international Phase 3 study randomized adults with 
T2D on metformin with/without sulphonylurea. They received DAPA + SAXA or INS 
for 24 weeks (short-term) with a 28-week (long-term) extension. Week 52 
exploratory endpoints included adjusted mean change from baseline in glycated 
haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight, and a proportion of patients achieving 
optimal glycaemic response without hypoglycaemia and without requiring rescue 
medication.
RESULTS: Of the 1163 patients enrolled, 643 received treatment; 600 (DAPA + 
SAXA, 306; INS, 294) entered the long-term phase. At 52 weeks, HbA1c [adjusted 
least squares (LS) mean; 95% confidence interval (CI)] decreased more with DAPA 
+ SAXA (-1.5% [-1.6%, -1.4%]) than with INS (-1.3% [-1.4%, -1.1%]); the LS mean 
difference (95% CI) was -0.25% (-0.4%, -0.1%; P = 0.009). Total body weight 
reduced with DAPA + SAXA [LS mean (95% CI): -1.8 kg (-2.4, -1.3)] and increased 
with INS [LS mean (95% CI): +2.8 kg (2.2, 3.3)]. More patients on DAPA + SAXA 
(17.6%) achieved HbA1c <7.0% without hypoglycaemia versus those on INS (9.1%). 
Rescue medication was required by 77 patients (23.8%) and 97 patients (30.4%) in 
the DAPA + SAXA and INS groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: DAPA + SAXA treatment was non-inferior to INS in reducing HbA1c and 
body weight, and in achieving optimal glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia in 
patients with T2D 52 weeks after initiation.
