AIMS: To determine the optimal dose(s) of once-monthly administration of 
efpeglenatide, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), 
in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled on metformin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind trial (NCT02081118), patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 
subcutaneous efpeglenatide (8, 12 or 16 mg once monthly; n = 158) or placebo (n 
= 51). The 16-week treatment period included a 4-week titration phase with 
once-weekly efpeglenatide 4 mg, followed by one dose of efpeglenatide 8 mg once 
monthly and two doses of the assigned once-monthly dose. The primary endpoint 
was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to week 17.
RESULTS: All efpeglenatide doses significantly reduced HbA1c versus placebo (P 
< 0.0001 for all). Overall, the least squares mean difference in HbA1c 
reductions between efpeglenatide and placebo was -7.7 mmol/mol (-0.71%; baseline 
to week 17). At week 17, a significantly greater proportion of efpeglenatide 
patients had an HbA1c level <53 mmol/mol (<7%) versus placebo (48.7% vs. 30.6%; 
P = 0.0320). Significant body weight loss occurred across all efpeglenatide 
doses (placebo-corrected reduction -2.0 kg [efpeglenatide overall]; P = 0.0003). 
The safety profile was consistent with GLP-1RAs, with gastrointestinal (GI) 
disorders being the most common treatment-emergent adverse events. Fluctuations 
in effects on glucose levels and rates of GI events occurred between peak and 
trough efpeglenatide concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: Efpeglenatide once monthly (following once-weekly titration) has 
significant benefits with regard to HbA1c and weight reduction versus placebo in 
patients with T2D. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy 
and safety of efpeglenatide once monthly.
