Interactions between drugs and micronutrients have received only little or no 
attention in the medical and pharmaceutical world in the past. Since more and 
more pharmaceutics are used for the treatment of patients, this topic is 
increasingly relevant. As such interactions - depending on the duration of 
treatment and the status of micronutrients - impact the health of the patient 
and the action of the drugs, physicians and pharmacists should pay more 
attention to such interactions in the future. This review aims to sensitize 
physicians and pharmacists on drug micronutrient interactions with selected 
examples of widely pescribed drugs that can precipitate micronutrient 
deficiencies. In this context, the pharmacist, as a drug expert, assumes a 
particular role. Like no other professional in the health care sector, he is 
particularly predestined and called up to respond to this task. The following 
article intends to point out the relevance of mutual interactions between 
micronutrients and various examples of widely used drugs, without claiming to be 
exhaustive.
