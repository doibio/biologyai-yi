BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is commonly present in estrogen-deficient 
states, e.g., after menopause. In the search for alternatives to hormone 
replacement therapy (HRT), treatments based on phytoestrogens or in non-hormonal 
mechanisms have been under evaluation.
OBJECTIVE: Here we aim to present an overview of innovative potential treatments 
for endothelial dysfunction in estrogen-deficient states, introducing our own 
preliminary data about the probiotic kefir.
METHODS: We conducted a review based on a PubMed database search for keywords of 
interest (Menopause, Ovariectomy, Vascular dysfunction, Hot flashes, Metformin, 
Statins, Phytoestrogens, Omega-3, Vitamin D, Probiotics).
RESULTS: Vascular parameters were found to be improved by both metformin and 
statins through pleiotropic effects, being related to a decrease in oxidative 
stress and restoration of the nitric oxide pathway. Phytoestrogens such as 
genistein and resveratrol have also been shown to improve vascular dysfunction, 
which seems to involve their estrogenic-like actions. Omega-3, vitamin D and its 
analogues, as well as probiotics, have shown similar vascular beneficial effects 
in both postmenopausal women and an animal model of ovariectomy (OVX), which 
could be related to antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, our 
preliminary data on the probiotic kefir treatment in OVX rats suggested a 
vascular antioxidant effect. In particular, some evidence points to statins and 
vitamin D having anti-atherogenic effects.
CONCLUSION: Pleiotropic effects of common medications and natural compounds 
could have therapeutic potential for endothelial dysfunction in 
estrogen-deficient states. They could, therefore, work as future complementary 
or alternative treatments to HRT.
