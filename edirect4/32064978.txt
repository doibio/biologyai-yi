Aim: Patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) are frequently on other 
medications for co-morbidities. We explored the impact of concomitant medication 
use on outcomes. Materials & methods: 210 metastatic cancer patients on CPI were 
identified and association between concomitant medication use and immune-related 
adverse events with clinical outcomes was determined. Results: Aspirin, 
metformin, β-blockers and statins were not shown to have any statistically 
significant difference on clinical benefit. 26.3% patients with clinical benefit 
developed rash versus 11.8% without clinical benefit (p < 0.05) on multivariate 
analysis. Conclusion: Use of common prescription and nonprescription medications 
in patients with multiple co-morbidities appears safe and does not have an 
adverse effect on CPI efficacy. The presence of rash predicted for a better 
response.
