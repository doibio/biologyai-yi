OBJECTIVE: In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revised 
metformin's label to permit use in patients with mild-moderate chronic kidney 
disease. We sought to determine whether this change was associated with 
increased reports of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) to the FDA's 
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Publicly available FAERS reports were analyzed.
RESULTS: MALA reports increased from 521 in 2015 to 1,939 in 2018. After 
restriction to U.S. reports, absolute and relative increase in MALA reports was 
less, from 111 to 243. The proportionate reporting ratio (PRR), a measure 
adjusted for rates of other adverse event reports, was stable.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased reports deserve attention, but the PRR's stability 
and FAERS's known limitations, including lack of a denominator or control group, 
do not permit the conclusion that U.S. MALA rates have increased. Further study 
with more robust data sources is needed.
