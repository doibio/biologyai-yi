BACKGROUND/AIM: Adnexal torsion is a common gynaecological emergency, and 
considered to be a problem mostly in reproductive-age women. To evaluatethe 
effect of metformin and detorsion treatment on reducing ovarian reserve in an 
ovarian torsion model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four nonpregnant, Wistar Hannover rats were 
included in the study. Animals were divided into 3 groups: the control group, 
the detorsion only group, and the metformin + detorsion group. The first group 
received only laparotomy. In the second group, ovaries were fixed to the 
abdominal wall after performing 360° ovarian torsion, followed by detorsion 
after a 3-h period of ischemia. The third group underwent the same torsion and 
detorsion procedures as the second group, and received 50 mg/kg metformin by 
gavage for 14 days. Ovarian damage scores, follicle counts, and AMH levels were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: The total damage score was significantly increased in the detorsion 
only group compared to the metformin+detorsion and control groups. 
Pre-operative/post-operative AMH decreases were statistically significant in 
negative direction in the detorsion only group when compared to the 
metformin+detorsion and control groups (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Metformin+detorsion treatment may be effective in protecting the 
ovarian reserve after ovarian torsion.
