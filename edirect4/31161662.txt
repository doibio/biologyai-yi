AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) is widely used for 
the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in several countries such as Japan, 
whereas biguanide (BG; mostly metformin) is recommended as a first-line 
antidiabetic medication in many countries according to evidence mainly from 
Western countries. Although previous studies reported that DPP4i may be more 
efficacious for East Asians, direct comparisons of effectiveness and cost 
between DPP4i and BG have never been conducted in East Asia.
METHODS: We extracted claims and medical check-up data (observation period from 
January 2010 to March 2016) of adult patients under 70 years old with T2DM who 
received DPP4i or BG as first-line antidiabetic drugs. Changes in HbA1c and BMI 
before and 2 years after the first prescription and annual cost of antidiabetic 
medication during the second year were compared between the DPP4i and BG groups.
RESULTS: We extracted 1034 patients who received DPP4i and 365 patients who 
received BG as the first antidiabetic medication (male sex, 83.0% and 84.9%; 
HbA1c (mean [SD]), 7.7 [1.4]% and 7.9 [1.4]%; BMI, 26.6 [4.5] kg/m2 and 28.1 
[4.3] kg/m2 ). After propensity score matching, changes in HbA1c and BMI were 
not significantly different between the groups (HbA1c, -0.67% vs -0.80% 
[P = .28]; BMI, -0.3 kg/m2 vs -0.4 kg/m2 [P = .42]). Annual cost of antidiabetic 
drugs was significantly higher in the DPP4i group (US $458.7 vs 273.3 
[P < .001]). Many patients continued each medication at the follow-up visit 
(78.3% of the DPP4i group and 73.7% of the BG groups).
CONCLUSIONS: The first antidiabetic prescription for the patient was mostly 
continued thereafter. BG may be recommendable as the first-line medication for 
patients with T2DM, especially for middle-aged, male population with greater 
BMI. It is worth addressing the discrepancy between practice in Japan and that 
recommended in international guidelines.
