BACKGROUND: Cocos nucifera, belonging to Arecaceae family, holds quite an 
importance in the Indian traditional medicinal system. C.nucifera inflorescence 
(CnI) has been reported in the literature to be useful in the treatment of 
diarrhoea, dysentery, diabetes, and dyspepsia. In this study, we aimed to 
evaluate the efficacy of CnI as an adjuvant with metformin in ameliorating 
Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2-DM).
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate antidiabetic activity of CnI in combination with 
metformin in Streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats using 
streptozotocin (45 mg/kg; i.p.). Plasma glucose level (PGL) was estimated after 
72 h of STZ injection. Ethanolic extract of CnI (250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg) per se 
and in combination with metformin (22.5 mg/kg) was administered orally once 
daily to rats for a period of 28 days. PGL level was estimated on 7th, 14th and 
21st day followed by Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and PGL both on the 28th 
day of treatment. DPPH assay was performed to evaluate antioxidant activity of 
CnI extract.
RESULTS: Extract of CnI (250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg alone and the combination of 
extract (250 mg/kg) along with metformin (22.5 mg/kg) significantly decreased 
PGL (p < 0.0001) on 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days. Histopathological analysis of 
pancreatic tissue showed that treatment with CnI extract per se and in 
combination with metformin improved the damaged architecture of pancreas.
CONCLUSION: The combination therapy of CnI and metformin produced a significant 
antidiabetic effect than that of the extract alone and provides a scientific 
rationale for their use in antidiabetic therapy as an adjuvant.
