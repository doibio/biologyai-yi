AIM: To compare the effect of liraglutide or placebo added on to sodium-glucose 
co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) ± metformin on glycaemic control in patients 
with type 2 diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes on a stable SGLT2i dose ± 
metformin (with HbA1c 7.0%-9.5% and body mass index [BMI] ≥ 20 kg/m2 ) were 
randomized 2:1 to add-on liraglutide 1.8 mg/day or placebo in this parallel, 
double-blind, multinational trial. Primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints 
were changes in HbA1c and body weight from baseline to week 26, respectively. 
The proportions of patients achieving HbA1c (<7.0%) targets and safety events 
after week 26 were also assessed.
RESULTS: Of 303 patients randomized (one in error), 280 completed treatment. 
Mean changes in HbA1c from baseline to week 26 with liraglutide (n = 202) and 
placebo (n = 100) were - 0.98% and - 0.30%, respectively (estimated treatment 
difference [ETD]: -0.68% [95% CI: -0.89, -0.48]; P < 0.001). Mean body weight 
changes from baseline were - 2.81 versus -1.99 kg, respectively (ETD: -0.82 kg 
[95% CI: -1.73, 0.09]; P = 0.077); 51.8% of liraglutide-treated patients 
achieved HbA1c < 7.0% versus 23.2% receiving placebo (odds ratio: 5.1 [95% CI: 
2.67, 9.87]; P < 0.001). More patients treated with liraglutide reported ≥1 
treatment-emergent adverse events (66.3%) versus placebo (47.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Liraglutide significantly improved glycaemic control compared with 
placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes, insufficiently controlled with SGLT2is 
with/without metformin, with no unexpected safety findings.
