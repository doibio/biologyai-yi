Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles involved in many cellular functions. 
Beyond their central role in metabolism, they also take a part in maintaining 
calcium homeostasis, cell death, immunity, and ROS production. Changes in these 
functions have been shown to be crucial for the adaptation and survival of 
cancer cells. Mitochondria, therefore, constitute a promising target for the 
development of novel anticancer agents. The triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) moiety 
has been widely used to target molecules into mitochondria. TPP+ derivatives of 
a variety of conventional cytostatic drugs, natural substances, metformin, 
antioxidants or a range of newly synthesized molecules have shown promising 
results against cancer cells. In this review, we discuss biochemical differences 
between cancer cells and normal cells with a specific focus on mitochondria, and 
how mitochondrially targeted molecules can be used to selectively affect 
mitochondrial function in normal and cancer cells. We summarize the published 
data on mitochondrially targeted anticancer agents and propose future research 
avenues.
