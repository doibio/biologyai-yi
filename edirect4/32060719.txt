BACKGROUND: Metformin, a drug widely used in the treatment of diabetes, has 
proven preventive and survival benefits for various malignancies. However, the 
effect of metformin on gastric cancer risk and survival rate in T2DM patients 
remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of metformin on gastric cancer in T2DM 
patients.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medline and the Cochrane Library for 
related studies up to October 22, 2019. Pooled hazard ratios with 95% confidence 
intervals were calculated using random-effects model. Heterogeneity was 
assessed. All articles were evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: A total of 11 cohort studies met eligibility criteria and were included 
in the meta-analysis. The use of metformin was related to a significant 21% 
reduction in GC incidence (HR 0.790; 95% CI 0.624-1.001). Subgroup analysis 
showed that the use of metformin significantly reduced the risk of gastric 
cancer in T2DM patients in Asian populations, but not in western populations. In 
a pooled analysis of 3 studies, metformin use was associated with increased 
overall survival rate (HR 0.817; 95% CI 0.600-1.113) and cancer-specific 
survival rate (HR 0.824; 95% CI 0.614-1.106) of T2DM patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin could reduce the risk of gastric cancer in T2DM patients, 
particularly in Asian populations. However, it is debatable whether metformin 
use can improve the prognosis of gastric cancer in T2DM patients.
