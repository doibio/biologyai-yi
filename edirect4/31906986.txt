BACKGROUND: Recent evidence indicates that metformin inhibits mammalian cancer 
growth and metastasis through the regulation of microRNAs. Metformin regulates 
miR-381 stability, which plays a vital role in tumor progression. Moreover, 
increased YAP expression and activity induce non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
tumor growth and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism underpinning how 
metformin-induced upregulation of miR-381 directly targets YAP or its 
interactions with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker protein 
Snail in NSCLC is still unknown.
METHODS: Levels of RNA and protein were analyzed using qPCR, western blotting 
and immunofluorescence staining. Cellular proliferation was detected using a 
CCK8 assay. Cell migration and invasion were analyzed using wound healing and 
transwell assays. Promoter activity and transcription were investigated using 
the luciferase reporter assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to detect 
the binding of YAP to the promoter of Snail. The interaction between miR-381 and 
the 3'UTR of YAP mRNA was analyzed using the MS2 expression system and 
co-immunoprecipitation with biotin.
RESULTS: We observed that miR-381 expression is negatively correlated with YAP 
expression and plays an opposite role to YAP in the regulation of cellular 
proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT of NSCLC cells. The miR-381 function 
as a tumor suppressor was significantly downregulated in lung cancer tissue 
specimens and cell lines, which decreased the expression of its direct target 
YAP. In addition, metformin decreased cell growth, migration, invasion, and EMT 
via up-regulation of miR-381. Moreover, YAP, which functions as a 
co-transcription factor, enhanced NSCLC progression and metastasis by 
upregulation of Snail. Snail knockdown downregulated the mesenchymal marker 
vimentin and upregulated the epithelial marker E-cadherin in lung cancer cells. 
Furthermore, miR-381, YAP, and Snail constitute the miR-381-YAP-Snail signal 
axis, which is repressed by metformin, and enhances cancer cell invasiveness by 
directly regulating EMT.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin-induced repression of miR-381-YAP-Snail axis activity 
disrupts NSCLC growth and metastasis. Thus, we believe that the 
miR-381-YAP-Snail signal axis may be a suitable diagnostic marker and a 
potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.
