OBJECTIVES: Electronic health records (EHR) provide a valuable resource for 
assessing drug side-effects, but treatments are not randomly allocated in 
routine care creating the potential for bias. We conduct a case study using the 
Prior Event Rate Ratio (PERR) Pairwise method to reduce unmeasured confounding 
bias in side-effect estimates for two second-line therapies for type 2 diabetes, 
thiazolidinediones, and sulfonylureas.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Primary care data were extracted from the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (n = 41,871). We utilized outcomes from the period 
when patients took first-line metformin to adjust for unmeasured confounding. 
Estimates for known side-effects and a negative control outcome were compared 
with the A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT) trial (n = 2,545).
RESULTS: When on metformin, patients later prescribed thiazolidinediones had 
greater risks of edema, HR 95% CI 1.38 (1.13, 1.68) and gastrointestinal 
side-effects (GI) 1.47 (1.28, 1.68), suggesting the presence of unmeasured 
confounding. Conventional Cox regression overestimated the risk of edema on 
thiazolidinediones and identified a false association with GI. The PERR Pairwise 
estimates were consistent with ADOPT: 1.43 (1.10, 1.83) vs. 1.39 (1.04, 1.86), 
respectively, for edema, and 0.91 (0.79, 1.05) vs. 0.94 (0.80, 1.10) for GI.
CONCLUSION: The PERR Pairwise approach offers potential for enhancing 
postmarketing surveillance of side-effects from EHRs but requires careful 
consideration of assumptions.
