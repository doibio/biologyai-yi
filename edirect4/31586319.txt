Today, excluding insulin, there are eight classes of anti-diabetic medicines 
that have been added to the pharmacy since the introduction of metformin in the 
mid-1950s; the sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, α-glucosidase 
inhibitors, meglitinides, incretins, and sodium glucose transport 2 inhibitors. 
Does the fact that metformin is still first-line treatment suggest that our drug 
discovery efforts over the past 60 years have not been good enough? Or does it 
suggest that diabetes is such a complex disorder that no single treatment, other 
than gastric bypass surgery, can affect true normalization of not only blood 
sugar but also the underlying pathologies? Our understanding of the disease has 
most definitely improved which may bring hope for the future in terms of 
science, but for it to be beneficial, this science has to be translated into 
better drug treatments for the disease. In this review, I have examined the 
eight classes of anti-diabetes drugs from a drug discovery perspective.
