BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension are independently 
related to increasing risk of subsequent incident heart failure with preserved 
ejection fraction (HFpEF). This study was designed to evaluate the influences of 
long-term metformin prescription in these patients.
METHODS: Using a propensity score matching of 1:2 ratio, this retrospective 
claims database study compared metformin prescription (n = 130) and 
non-metformin therapy (n = 260) in patients with T2DM and hypertension and 
without clinical signs or symptoms of heart failure.
RESULTS: With a follow-up of 6 years, the new-onset symptomatic HFpEF occurred 
in 6 of 130 patients in metformin group and 31 of 260 patients in non-metformin 
group (P = .020). Metformin also generated more prominent improvement in left 
ventricular (LV) diastolic function and hypertrophy. And Cox proportional 
hazards regression model revealed that metformin prescription (HR 0.351, 95% CI: 
0.145-0.846, P = .020) was associated with a reduced risk of new onset of 
symptomatic HFpEF.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term metformin exposure was associated with protective effects 
in terms of the incidence of new-onset symptomatic HFpEF, LV diastolic 
dysfunction and hypertrophy in patients with T2DM and hypertension, which might 
be beneficial for the delay of HFpEF progression.
