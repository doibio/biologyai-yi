BACKGROUND: Profound skeletal muscle wasting and weakness is common after severe 
burn and persists for years after injury contributing to morbidity and mortality 
of burn patients. Currently, no ideal treatment exists to inhibit muscle 
catabolism. Metformin is an anti-diabetic agent that manages hyperglycemia but 
has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on stem cells after injury. We 
hypothesize that metformin administration will increase protein synthesis in the 
skeletal muscle by increasing the proliferation of muscle progenitor cells, thus 
mitigating muscle atrophy post-burn injury.
METHODS: To determine whether metformin can attenuate muscle catabolism 
following burn injury, we utilized a 30% total burn surface area (TBSA) 
full-thickness scald burn in mice and compared burn injuries with and without 
metformin treatment. We examined the gastrocnemius muscle at 7 and 14 days 
post-burn injury.
RESULTS: At 7 days, burn injury significantly reduced myofiber cross-sectional 
area (CSA) compared to sham, p < 0.05. Metformin treatment significantly 
attenuated muscle catabolism and preserved muscle CSA at the sham size. To 
investigate metformin's effect on satellite cells (muscle progenitors), we 
examined changes in Pax7, a transcription factor regulating the proliferation of 
muscle progenitors. Burned animals treated with metformin had a significant 
increase in Pax7 protein level and the number of Pax7-positive cells at 7 days 
post-burn, p < 0.05. Moreover, through BrdU proliferation assay, we show that 
metformin treatment increased the proliferation of satellite cells at 7 days 
post-burn injury, p < 0.05.
CONCLUSION: In summary, metformin's various metabolic effects and its modulation 
of stem cells make it an attractive alternative to mitigate burn-induced muscle 
wasting while also managing hyperglycemia.
