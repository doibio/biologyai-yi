Metformin, an antidiabetic agent, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in 1994 for treating type 2 diabetes. This medication comes 
in both immediate- and extended-release formulations and is often combined with 
other antidiabetic agents. The off-label indications of metformin include 
managing gestational diabetes, addressing weight gain issues caused by 
antipsychotic medication, preventing type 2 diabetes, and treating and 
preventing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Metformin is currently the only 
antidiabetic medication for prediabetes recommended by the American Diabetes 
Association (ADA). Furthermore, regarding potential indications, researchers are 
studying metformin for its possible antiaging, anticancer, and 
neuroprotective effects. This activity offers a comprehensive review of 
metformin's indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. In addition, it 
emphasizes the crucial role played by the interprofessional team in effectively 
managing patients with diabetes.
