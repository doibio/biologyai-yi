Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 18% of those over the age 
of 65 years. Potentially inappropriate medication prescribing in people with CKD 
is common. Objectives: Develop a pragmatic list of medications used in primary 
care that required dose adjustment or avoidance in people with CKD, using a 
modified Delphi panel approach, followed by a consensus workshop. Methods: We 
conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify potential medications. A 
group of 17 experts participated in a 3-round modified Delphi panel to identify 
medications for inclusion. A subsequent consensus workshop of 8 experts reviewed 
this list to prioritize medications for the development of point-of-care 
knowledge translation materials for primary care. Results: After a comprehensive 
literature review, 59 medications were included for consideration by the Delphi 
panel, with a further 10 medications added after the initial round. On 
completion of the 3 Delphi rounds, 66 unique medications remained, 63 requiring 
dose adjustment and 16 medications requiring avoidance in one or more estimated 
glomerular filtration rate categories. The consensus workshop prioritized this 
list further to 24 medications that must be dose-adjusted or avoided, including 
baclofen, metformin, and digoxin, as well as the newer SGLT2 inhibitor agents. 
Conclusion and Relevance: We have developed a concise list of 24 medications 
commonly used in primary care that should be dose-adjusted or avoided in people 
with CKD to reduce harm. This list incorporates new and frequently prescribed 
medications and will inform an updated, easy to access source for primary care 
providers.
