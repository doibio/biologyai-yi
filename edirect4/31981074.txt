Prion diseases are fatal infectious neurodegenerative disorders in human and 
animals caused by misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into the 
infectious isoform PrPSc. These diseases have the potential to transmit within 
or between species, and no cure is available to date. Targeting the unfolded 
protein response (UPR) as an anti-prion therapeutic approach has been widely 
reported for prion diseases. Here, we describe the anti-prion effect of the 
chemical compound Sephin1 which has been shown to protect in mouse models of 
protein misfolding diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 
multiple sclerosis (MS) by selectively inhibiting the stress-induced regulatory 
subunit of protein phosphatase 1, thus prolonging eIF2Î± phosphorylation. We show 
here that Sephin1 dose and time dependently reduced PrPSc in different neuronal 
cell lines which were persistently infected with various prion strains. In 
addition, prion seeding activity was reduced in Sephin1-treated cells. 
Importantly, we found that Sephin1 significantly overcame the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress induced in treated cells, as measured by lower expression 
of stress-induced aberrant prion protein. In a mouse model of prion infection, 
intraperitoneal treatment with Sephin1 significantly prolonged survival of 
prion-infected mice. When combining Sephin1 with the neuroprotective drug 
metformin, the survival of prion-infected mice was also prolonged. These results 
suggest that Sephin1 could be a potential anti-prion drug selectively targeting 
one component of the UPR pathway.
