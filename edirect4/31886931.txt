BACKGROUND: Individual health behaviors (ie, eating habits and sedentary 
lifestyle) are associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Health behavior profiles 
specific to adolescents with T2D have not been described.
OBJECTIVE: To identify health behavior profiles in adolescents with T2D and 
examine how these profiles change over time.
METHODS: Diet (via food frequency questionnaire) and activity behaviors (via 
3-day physical activity recall) examined at baseline, 6 months, and 24 months 
from participants in the the Treatment Options for T2D in Adolescents and Youth 
(TODAY) study were used for this analysis. Latent profile analysis identified 
profiles of health behaviors within three time points, and latent transition 
probabilities were estimated to examine the change from baseline to 6 months (n 
= 450) and baseline to 24 months (n = 415). Multinomial logistic regressions 
were used to examine if the assigned TODAY treatment group (Metformin [Met], Met 
+ Rosiglitazone [Rosi], or Met + Lifestyle) predicted change in health behavior 
profiles.
RESULTS: Three profiles emerged: "most sedentary," "healthy eaters," and "active 
and eat most." At 6 months, 50% of males and 29% of females in the Met + 
Lifestyle treatment group improved in their health behavior profile. Among males 
only, the Met + Lifestyle treatment group were more likely to improve their 
profiles from baseline to 6 months (P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Three health behavior profiles emerged and shifted over time. A 
high quality, lifestyle intervention had little effect on improving health 
behavior profiles. Optimizing outcomes in youth with T2D might require more 
robust and multifaceted interventions beyond family-level lifestyle, including 
more extensive psychosocial intervention, novel medication regimen, or bariatric 
surgery.
