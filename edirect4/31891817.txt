Here, we developed platelet membranes (PM) as nano-carriers to co-encapsulate 
metformin (Met) and IR780 (PM-IR780-Met NPs). The resulting nano-carrier ensured 
a longer circulation lifetime and facilitated the greater accumulation of IR780 
and Met in tumors owing to the active adhesion between PM and tumor cells. As a 
photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent, IR780 could effectively kill the tumor by 
producing toxic reactive singlet oxygen species (ROS), while the introduction of 
Met inhibited mitochondrial respiration and reduced tumor oxygen consumption, 
thereby evoking an oxygen-boosted PDT and propelling the immunogenic cell death 
(ICD)-based immunogenic pathway. Meanwhile, the reversed tumor hypoxia also 
impeded the myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-regulated immunosuppressive 
pathway. Finally, tremendous T cells were recruited and activated, providing a 
promising platform to eliminate the primary tumors and synchronously opening a 
new avenue for the effective ablation of tumor metastasis.
