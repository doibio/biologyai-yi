OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether hydro-alcoholic extract of aerial parts of 
Caralluma fimbriata (CFE) could attenuate high-fat diet (HFD) induced cardiac 
damage.
METHODS: Forty rats were divided into five groups: control (C), treated with 
CFE, treated with HFD, HFD treated with CFE, and HFD treated with metformin 
(Met).
RESULTS: CFE treatment significantly (p < .001) attenuated HFD-induced increase 
in cardiac lipids such as total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and 
free fatty acids and decreased phospholipids accompanied by increasing in lipid 
peroxidation and protein oxidation. Furthermore, significant reduction in the 
activities of antioxidant enzymes, creatine kinase and aldose reductase and 
sorbitol dehydrogenase was also observed in HFD fed rats. These changes were 
alleviated by CFE. Moreover, the histopathological observations of heart are 
also in agreement with the biochemical findings.
CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed that CFE could be used as adjuvant 
therapy for preventing or managing high fat diet induced cardiac damage.
