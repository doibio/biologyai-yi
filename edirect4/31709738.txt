AIMS: To evaluate whether there is a difference between the effects of 
dapagliflozin and gliclazide modified release (MR) on glycaemic variability (GV) 
and glycaemic control, as assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), in 
individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, open-label, active-controlled study was 
conducted in individuals with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who were drug-naïve 
or on steady-dose metformin monotherapy. Participants were treated once daily 
with 10 mg dapagliflozin or 120 mg gliclazide MR. CGM and GV index calculations 
were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks.
RESULTS: In total, 97 participants (age 57.9 ± 8.7 years, 50.5% men, baseline 
glycated haemoglobin 63 ± 9.8 mmol/mol [7.9 ± 0.9%]) were randomized, and 94 
completed the 12-week protocol. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) 
analyses showed that the reduction in GV, as measured by the mean amplitude of 
glycaemic excursions, was superior in the dapagliflozin group versus the 
gliclazide MR group (-0.9 mmol/L [95% CI -1.5, -0.4] vs -0.2 mmol/L [95% CI 
-0.6, 0.3]; P = 0.030 [ITT]). The reductions in GV estimated by the coefficient 
of variation and SD were greater in the dapagliflozin group. Moreover, 
dapagliflozin increased the glucose time in range (TIR; 3.9-10 mmol/L) by 24.9% 
(95% CI 18.6, 31.2) vs. 17.4% (95% CI 11.6, 23.3) in the gliclazide MR group (P 
= 0.089 [ITT]; P = 0.041 [PP]).
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin improved GV and increased TIR more efficiently than 
gliclazide MR in individuals with type 2 diabetes over 12 weeks, as demonstrated 
by CGM.
