Though limited success through chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery has been 
obtained for efficient cancer therapy for modern decades, cancers are still 
considered high burden to human health worldwide to date. Recently repurposing 
drugs are attractive with lower cost and shorter time compared to classical drug 
discovery, just as Metformin from Galega officinalis, originally approved for 
treating Type 2 diabetes by FDA, is globally valued at millions of US dollars 
for cancer therapy. As most previous reviews focused on FDA approved drugs and 
synthetic agents, current review discussed the anticancer potential of 
phytochemicals originally approved for treatment of cardiovascular diseases, 
diabetes, infectious diarrhea, depression and malaria with their molecular 
mechanisms and efficacies and suggested future research perspectives.
