OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin B12 
deficiency amongst diabetic patients on metformin therapy.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at general clinics at the 
University Health Center and diabetes outpatient clinics at Sultan Qaboos 
University Hospital, Muscat, Oman, between January and December 2017. All Omani 
adults who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and took metformin were 
invited to participate in the study. The variables included in this study were 
age, gender, duration of diabetes, dose and duration of metformin therapy, 
haemoglobin and glycosylated haemoglobin level.
RESULTS: A total of 248 subjects were included (response rate = 95.4%) of which 
26 (10.5%) were vitamin B12 deficient and 53 (21.4%) were borderline deficient. 
The mean daily dose of metformin was highest among vitamin B12 deficient group 
(1,981 ± 222 mg; P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency is considerable among 
diabetic patients on metformin therapy. Further research is needed to confirm 
the need for routine screening and monitoring.
