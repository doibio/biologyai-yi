BACKGROUND: EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) assessed 
the impact of once-weekly exenatide 2 mg versus placebo in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus, while aiming for glycemic equipoise. Consequently, greater 
drop-in of open-label glucose-lowering medications occurred in the placebo 
group. Accordingly, we explored the potential effects of their unbalanced use on 
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, and all-cause mortality 
(ACM), given that some of these agents are cardioprotective.
METHODS: Cox hazard models were performed by randomized treatment for drug 
classes where >5% open-label drop-in glucose-lowering medication occurred, and 
for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; 3.0%) using three 
methodologies: drop-in visit right censoring, inverse probability for treatment 
weighting (IPTW), and applying drug class risk reductions.
RESULTS: Baseline glucose-lowering medications for the 14 752 EXSCEL 
participants (73.1% with previous cardiovascular disease) did not differ between 
treatment groups. During median 3.2 years follow-up, open-label drop-in occurred 
in 33.4% of participants, more frequently with placebo than exenatide (38.1% 
versus 28.8%), with metformin (6.1% versus 4.9%), sulfonylurea (8.7% versus 
6.9%), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (10.6% versus 7.5%), SGLT-2i (10.3% 
versus 8.1%), GLP-1 RA (3.4% versus 2.4%), and insulin (13.8% versus 9.4%). The 
MACE effect size was not altered meaningfully by right censoring, but the 
favorable HR for exenatide became nominally significant in the sulfonylurea and 
any glucose-lowering medication groups, while the ACM HR and p-values were 
essentially unchanged. IPTW decreased the MACE HR from 0.91 (P=0.061) to 0.85 
(P=0.008) and the ACM HR from 0.86 (P=0.016) to 0.81 (P=0.012). Application of 
literature-derived risk reductions showed no meaningful changes in MACE or ACM 
HRs or P values, although simulations of substantially greater use of drop-in 
cardioprotective glucose-lowering agents demonstrated blunting of signal 
detection.
CONCLUSIONS: EXSCEL-observed HRs for MACE and ACM remained robust after right 
censoring or application of literature-derived risk reductions, but the 
exenatide versus placebo MACE effect size and statistical significance were 
increased by IPTW. Effects of open-label drop-in cardioprotective medications 
need to be considered carefully when designing, conducting, and analyzing 
cardiovascular outcome trials of glucose-lowering agents under the premise of 
glycemic equipoise. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique
