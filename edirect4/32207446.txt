Oral antidiabetic failure (OAD failure) is a term which is used frequently in 
clinical practice. There is no uniformly accepted definition, however, for this 
term. This communication describes the concept of OAD failure, and develops a 
working definition for the same. The definition uses resistant hypertension as 
an example, and assesses the relative role of various classes of OADs, lifestyle 
modification, secondary causes of hyperglycaemia, and symptomatology in diabetes 
praxis. It utilizes these concepts to build a definition of OAD failure which 
states: OAD failure is defined as a clinical situation where HbA1c remains above 
goal, despite concurrent use of optimum dose of three oral glucose lowering 
drugs of different classes, one of which should be metformin and the second, 
preferably a sulfonylurea, provided adequate diet and exercise have been 
followed, and comorbid conditions causing hyperglycaemia ruled out. OAD failure 
may also be defined in patients who have symptoms suggestive of insulinopenia 
(osmotic symptoms, weight loss), and uncontrolled glycaemia (plasma glucose> 
300mg %), in spite of using triple OAD therapy.
