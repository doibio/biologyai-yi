BACKGROUND: The specific treatment recommendations for type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) differ based on a particular guideline. The goal of pharmacotherapy is to 
achieve the target HbA1c and fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels to 
avoid disease complications.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the profile of T2DM patients on different antidiabetic 
treatment regimens and the factors leading to dose escalation in these patients.
METHODS: A prospective descriptive study was conducted at Kasturba Medical 
College Hospital, Mangalore, a tertiary care teaching hospital, over a period of 
one year. The study population comprised of patients with T2DM for ≥5 years. The 
demographic and clinical data were collected during the baseline and follow-up 
visits.
RESULTS: Of the 119 patients studied, 59.7% were males; 32.8% were ≥65 years of 
age. A significant decrease in the fasting blood glucose (FBG) on follow-up was 
seen (p = 0.028) in patients on sulfonylurea and metformin combination. A 
significant decrease in the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was seen in patients on 
sulfonylurea with metformin and pioglitazone (p = 0.011); sulfonylurea with 
metformin, pioglitazone, and sitagliptin (p = 0.026); and metformin with insulin 
(p = 0.001). Patients who received dose escalation had a longer duration of the 
disease (p = 0.042), higher FBG (p = 0.039) and HbA1c (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A combination of metformin with sulfonylurea was the preferred 
first-line treatment; insulin was added when HbA1c was >9. Patients who received 
dose escalation had a longer duration of the disease and higher FBG and HbA1c.
