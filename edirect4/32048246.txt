BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating autoimmune disorder 
characterized by oligodendrocytes (OLGs) loss and demyelination. In this study, 
we have examined the effects of metformin (MET) on the oligodendrogenesis, redox 
signaling, apoptosis, and glial responses during a self-repairing period 
(1-week) in the animal model of MS.
METHODS: For induction of demyelination, C57BL/6 J mice were fed a 0.2% 
cuprizone (CPZ) for 5 weeks. Thereafter, CPZ was removed for 1-week and 
molecular and behavioral changes were monitored in the presence or absence of 
MET (50 mg/kg body weight/day).
RESULTS: MET remarkably increased the localization of precursor OLGs (NG2+/O4+ 
cells) and subsequently the renewal of mature OLGs (MOG+ cells) in the corpus 
callosum via AMPK/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Moreover, we 
observed a significant elevation in the antioxidant responses, especially in 
mature OLGs (MOG+/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2+) cells) 
after MET intervention. MET also reduced brain apoptosis markers and lessened 
motor dysfunction in the open-field test. While MET was unable to decrease 
active astrogliosis (GFAP mRNA), it reduced microgliosis by down-regulation of 
Mac-3 mRNA a marker of pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages. Molecular 
modeling studies, likewise, confirmed that MET exerts its effects via direct 
interaction with AMPK.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our study reveals that MET effectively induces lesion 
reduction and elevated molecular processes that support myelin recovery via 
direct activation of AMPK and indirect regulation of AMPK/Nrf2/mTOR pathway in 
OLGs. These findings facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies 
based on AMPK activation for MS in the near future.
