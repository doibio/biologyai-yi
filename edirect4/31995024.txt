OBJECTIVE: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs reduce gastric acid secretion and 
lead to an increase in serum gastrin levels. Many preclinical and some clinical 
researches have established some positive effects of gastrin or PPI therapy on 
glucose regulation. The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the 
short term effects of esomeprazole on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. In addition, the presence of an association between this 
effect and gastrin levels was evaluated.
METHODS: Thirty-two subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled and 
grouped as intervention (n=16) and control (n=16). The participants in the 
intervention group were prescribed 40 mg of esomeprazole treatment for three 
months. At the beginning of the study and at the 3rd month, HbA1c level (%) and 
gastrin levels (pmol/L) of participants were assessed. Then, the groups were 
compared in terms of their baseline and 3rd month values.
RESULTS: In the intervention group, the mean gastrin level increased 
significantly from 34.3±14.4 pmol/L to 87.4±43.6 pmol/L (p<0.001). The mean 
HbA1c level was similar to the pre-treatment level (6.3±0.7% vs. 6.4±0.9%, 
p=0.441). There were no statistically significant differences in all parameters 
of the control group. The majority of individuals were on metformin monotherapy 
(65.6 %). The subgroup analysis of metformin monotherapy revealed that, in 
intervention group, there was a significant increase in gastrin levels 
(39.9±12.6 vs. 95.5±52.5, p=0.026), but the HbA1c levels did not change (6.0±0.4 
% vs. 5.9±0.6 %, p=0.288); and in control group, gastrin levels did not change 
(37.5 ± 26.7 vs. 36.1 ±23.3, p=0.367), but there was an increase in HbA1c levels 
(6.1 ± 0.50 vs. 6.4 ± 0.60, p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that esomeprazole has no extra benefit for 
the controlled diabetic patient in three months. However, in only the 
metformin-treated subgroup, esomeprazole may prevent the rise in HbA1c level.
