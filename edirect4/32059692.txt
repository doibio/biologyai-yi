BACKGROUND: Mexico has one of the highest prevalence rates of obesity worldwide. 
New pharmacological strategies that focus on people with class III obesity are 
required. Metformin and dapagliflozin are two drugs approved for the treatment 
of diabetes. Beyond its effects on glucose, metformin has been suggested by some 
studies to result in weight loss. Therapy with dapagliflozin is associated with 
a mild but sustained weight loss in patients with diabetes. The primary outcome 
of the study is to determine if the combined treatment with dapagliflozin and 
metformin is more effective than monotherapy with metformin for weight loss in 
patients with class III obesity and prediabetes or diabetes who are awaiting 
bariatric surgery (including those patients who do have surgery). We also aimed 
to assess the effect of this combined treatment on waist circumference, 
triglycerides, blood pressure, and inflammatory cytokines.
METHODS: This randomized phase IV clinical trial will include patients with 
diabetes or prediabetes who are between the ages of 18 and 60 years and exhibit 
grade III obesity (defined as body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m2). Patients using 
insulin will be excluded. Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups as 
follows: 1) metformin tablets 850 mg PO bid or 2) metformin tablets 850 mg PO 
bid plus dapagliflozin tablets 10 mg PO qd. The sample size required is 108 
patients, which allows for a 20% dropout rate: 54 patients in the metformin 
group and 54 in the metformin/dapagliflozin group. All participants will receive 
personalized nutritional advice during the study. A run-in period of one month 
will be used to assess tolerance and adherence to treatment regimens. 
Anthropometric and biochemical variables will be recorded at baseline and at 1, 
3, 6, and 12 months. A serum sample to determine glucagon, ghrelin, adiponectin, 
resistin, interleukin 6, and interleukin 10 will be collected at baseline and 
before surgery, or at 12 months (whatever happens first). Adherence to treatment 
and adverse and secondary events will be recorded throughout the study. An 
intention-to-treat analysis will be used.
DISCUSSION: Forty-six percent of the patients in our Obesity Clinic have been 
diagnosed with prediabetes (32%) or diabetes (14%). The use of dapagliflozin in 
this population could improve weight loss and other cardiovascular factors. This 
effect could be translated into less time before undergoing bariatric surgery 
and better control of associated comorbidities.
