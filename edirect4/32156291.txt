The gut microbiota is emerging as a prominent player in maintaining health 
through several metabolic and immune pathways. Dysregulation of gut microbiota 
composition, also known as dysbiosis, is involved in the clinical outcome of 
diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer, aging and HIV infection. Gut 
dysbiosis and inflammation persist in people living with HIV (PLWH) despite 
receiving antiretroviral therapy, further contributing to non-AIDS 
comorbidities. Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic agent, has been found to 
benefit microbiota composition, promote gut barrier integrity and reduce 
inflammation in human and animal models of diabetes. Inspired by the effect of 
metformin on diabetes-related gut dysbiosis, we herein critically review the 
relevance of metformin to control inflammation in PLWH. Metformin may improve 
gut microbiota composition, in turn reducing inflammation and risk of non-AIDS 
comorbidities. This review will pave the way towards innovative strategies to 
counteract dysregulated microbiota and improve the lives of PLWH.
