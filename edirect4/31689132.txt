Background: Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor that reduces 
glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). When approved in 
2013, data on vildagliptin combined with >750 mg/day metformin in Japanese 
patients were limited. There is a need to confirm the safety and efficacy of 
vildagliptin in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).Research design 
and methods: This 52-week post-marketing surveillance (PMS) observational study 
in Japanese T2DM patients evaluated the safety and efficacy of vildagliptin in 
combination with OADs including high-dose metformin or insulin but excluding 
combination with sulfonylureas alone.Results: During this survey of 3006 
Japanese T2DM patients, 13.61% of patients experienced adverse events (AEs) and 
2.20% reported a serious AE (SAE). The frequency of AEs/SAEs was similar when in 
combination with biguanides (12.93%/1.46%), metformin ≥1000 mg/day 
(12.92%/1.22%), metformin <1000 mg/day (12.62%/1.54%), thiazolidine derivatives 
(16.71%/2.86%), α-glucosidase inhibitors (13.18%/1.90%), rapid-acting insulin 
secretagogues  (glinides) (20.41%/5.71%), or insulin (15.87%/2.47%). The mean ± 
SD changes from baseline at endpoint in glycated hemoglobin and fasting blood 
glucose were -0.76 ± 1.27% and -23.3 ± 57.3 mg/dL, respectively, and these 
changes were consistent, regardless of concomitant OAD.Conclusions: Long-term 
vildagliptin combination therapy is safe and effective in Japanese T2DM patients 
in real-world settings.
