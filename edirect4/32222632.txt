Antibiotic contamination in drinking water sources has been increasingly 
prominent in recent years. The water quality in the Chongqing area is not only 
essential for the local people but also is crucial for the downstream of Yangzi 
River. To understand the level of antibiotic contamination in the large-scale 
drinking water sources, this study measured antibiotic residues in nine 
large-scale drinking water sources (five urban drinking water sources and four 
township drinking water sources) in Chongqing area of the Yangtze River. Results 
demonstrated that eight antibiotics of three categories in total were detected, 
including sulfonamide metformin (SMX), sulfonamide metformin (SMZ), erythromycin 
(ERM), Roxithromycin (ROM), Tylosin (TYL), Lincomycin (LIN), Chloramphenicol 
(CAP), and Florfenicol (FF). The mass concentration of antibiotic residues in 
five urban drinking water sources ranged from 13.9 to 76.6 ng/L, with an average 
of 46.4 ng/L, and that in four township drinking water sources ranged from 20.6 
to 188.1 ng/L, with an average of 88.45 ng/L. The mass concentrations of 
antibiotic residues in Chongqing area were much lower than those in other 
cities. Antibiotics posed the maximum risk with a value of 0.005 for 0-3 months 
of the infant. The risk quotients of antibiotic residues in all water sources 
were much lower than 1 and thus did not pose a direct threat to human health.
