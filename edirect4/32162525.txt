Alzheimer disease (AD) may develop after the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM), and the risk of AD may depend on the antidiabetic drug administered. We 
compared the risk of AD among 66 085 patients (â‰¥ 65 years) with T2DM (1250 
having concomitant AD) who had been administered antidiabetic drug monotherapy 
for T2DM who had voluntarily reported themselves in the Food and Drug 
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. The risk of AD from the use of 
different antidiabetic drug monotherapies compared to that of metformin 
monotherapy was assessed by logistic regression. Rosiglitazone (adjusted 
reporting odds ratio [aROR] = 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07-0.17; P < 
.001), exenatide (aROR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.11-0.37; P < .001), liraglutide (aROR = 
0.36; 95% CI: 0.19-0.62; P < .001), dulaglutide (aROR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.17-0.77; 
P = .014), and sitagliptin (aROR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.60-0.93; P = .011) were found 
to have a significantly lower associated risk of AD than that of metformin. 
Therefore, the administration of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and 
rosiglitazone may reduce the risk of AD in patients with T2DM.
