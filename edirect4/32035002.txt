BACKGROUND: Pre-clinical studies suggest that metformin and statins may delay 
prostate cancer (PCa) metastases; however, data in humans are limited. To the 
best of our knowledge, this is the first human study aimed to quantify the 
individual and joint effects of statin and metformin use among patients with 
high-risk PCa.
METHODS: This population-based retrospective cohort study identified patients 
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked 
database. Exposure to metformin and statins was ascertained from Medicare 
Prescription Drug Event files. The association with all-cause and PCa mortality 
were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard model with competing causes of 
death, where propensity scores were used to adjusted imbalances in covariates 
across groups.
RESULTS: Based on 12 700 patients with high-risk PCa, statin alone or in 
combination with metformin was significantly associated with reduced all-cause 
mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.89; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.83, 0.96; 
and HR: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67-0.83, respectively) and PCa mortality (HR, 0.80; 95% 
CI: 0.69, 0.92) and 0.64; 95% CI, d 0.51-0.81, respectively. The effects were 
more pronounced in post-diagnostic users: combination use of metformin/statins 
was associated with a 32% reduction in all-cause mortality (95% CI, 0.57-0.80), 
and 54% reduction in PCa mortality (95% CI, 0.30-0.69). No significant 
association of metformin alone was observed with either all-cause mortality or 
PCa mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use alone or in combination with metformin was associated 
with lower all-cause and PCa mortality among high-risk patients, particularly in 
post-diagnostic settings; further studies are warranted.
