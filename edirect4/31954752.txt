Metformin represents a striking example of a "historical nemesis" of a drug. 
About 40 years after its marketing in Europe, once demonstrated its efficacy and 
safety, metformin was registered also in the U.S. A few years later, it has 
become a mainstay in T2DM treatment, according to all international Scientific 
Societies guidelines. Today, despite the advent of new innovative drugs, 
metformin still persists as a first-choice drug in T2DM. This success is largely 
justified. In fact, over the years, also positive effects on health increased. 
In particular, evidence has been accumulated on a beneficial impact against many 
other aging-related morbidities (obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, cognitive decline and mortality). This literature review 
describes preclinical and clinical evidence favoring the "anti-aging" 
therapeutic potential of metformin outside of T2DM. The rationale to the use of 
metformin as part of a combined therapy in a variety of clinical settings, 
allowing for a reduction of the chemotherapy dose in cancer patients, has also 
been discussed. In particular, the focus was on metformin action on RAS/RAF/MAPK 
pathway. In the end, the real challenge for metformin could be to fully 
demonstrate beneficial effects on health even in non-diabetic subjects.
