BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder 
with unknown etiology. Evidence revealed that dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors 
(DPP4i) may increase the associated risk. This study aimed to evaluate the 
relationship of BP with the administration of DPP4i and other risk factors in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database (NHIRD) from 2009 
to 2013, we identified patients with T2DM and the use of DPP4i 12 weeks or 
greater as a DPP4i cohort and patients with T2DM who never use DPP4i as a 
control cohort. They were frequency matched on gender and age within 5 years at 
a ratio of 1:2. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to 
estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for the cohorts.
RESULTS: A total of 14,187 individuals taking DPP4i and 28,374 matched cohorts 
without taking DPP4i were included. The incidence rate of BP was higher in DPP4i 
cohort than in control cohort (1.41 vs. 0.59 per 1000 person-years; adjusted HR 
2.14, 95% CI = 1.02-4.50). The cumulative event rate of BP in DPP4i cohort was 
higher than in control cohort (log-rank test, p = .01). Patients with dementia 
and taking spironolactone had a higher associated risk to develop BP; lower 
associated risk in patients taking metformin.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM, subjects taking DPP4i, having dementia, and 
taking spironolactone were associated with an increased risk for the development 
of BP.
