BACKGROUND: It is generally thought that the occurrence and progression of 
osteoarthritis (OA) results from multiple causes, including degradation and 
destruction of the cartilage matrix and aging of chondrocytes. Metformin is a 
first-line drug for the treatment of diabetes, and has great potential for the 
treatment of other disorders. However, the role of metformin in OA is unknown.
RESULTS: Metformin displayed a protective effect against OA. There were lower 
OARSI scores and fewer MMP-13-positive cells in DMM mice and cartilage explants 
after treatment with metformin. In addition, metformin treatment decreased 
p16INK4a levels in OA chondrocytes, and enhanced polarization of AMPK and 
inhibition of mTORC1 in OA mice and chondrocytes in a dose-dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin effectively alleviated cartilage degradation and aging 
through regulation of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathways, suggesting that it could 
be an effective treatment for OA.
METHODS: The effects of metformin on cartilage degradation and chondrocyte aging 
was determined in a destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA 
mouse model and in IL-1Î²-treated mouse chondrocytes and cartilage explants. 
Articular cartilage degeneration was graded using the Osteoarthritis Research 
Society International (OARSI) criteria. Immunostaining, RT-PCR, and western blot 
analyses were conducted to detect the relative expressions of protein and RNA.
