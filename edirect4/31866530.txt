AIMS: This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the fracture risk among 
patients with T2DM treated with sulfonylurea.
METHODS: The PubMed and other databases were searched for eligible studies. Both 
randomized controlled trials and observational studies that compared the 
fracture risk of sulfonylurea to other hypoglycemic agents were included. Pooled 
risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Subgroup analysis and 
meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore the source of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: A total of 11 studies involving 255,644 individuals were included in 
our meta-analysis. In comparing sulfonylurea users with patients who had not 
taken sulfonylurea, the pooled risk ratio for developing fracture was 1.14 (95% 
confifidence interval, 1.08-1.19). In subgroup analyses, the pooled risk ratio 
of bone fracture in patients receiving sulfonylurea versus thiazolidinedione, 
metformin and insulin was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.76-1.06), 1.25 (95% CI, 1.18-1.32) and 
0.81 (95% CI, 0.74-0.89) respectively. Meta regression showed that age and 
gender were not related to the effect of sulfonylurea on fracture.
CONCLUSIONS: Sulfonylurea use was associated with 14% increase in the risk of 
developing fracture in T2DM. The risk of fracture caused by sulfonylurea was 
similar to thiazolidinedione, higher than metformin and lower than insulin.
