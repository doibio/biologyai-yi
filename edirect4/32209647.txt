OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fast-acting insulin aspart 
(faster aspart) compared with insulin aspart (IAsp), both with insulin degludec 
with or without metformin, in adults with type 2 diabetes not optimally 
controlled with a basal-bolus regimen.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, treat-to-target 
trial randomized participants to faster aspart (n = 546) or IAsp (n = 545). All 
available information, regardless of treatment discontinuation or use of 
ancillary treatment, was used for evaluation of effect.
RESULTS: Noninferiority for the change from baseline in HbA1c 16 weeks after 
randomization (primary end point) was confirmed for faster aspart versus IAsp 
(estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.04% [95% CI -0.11; 0.03]; -0.39 
mmol/mol [-1.15; 0.37]; P < 0.001). Faster aspart was superior to IAsp for 
change from baseline in 1-h postprandial glucose (PPG) increment using a meal 
test (ETD -0.40 mmol/L [-0.66; -0.14]; -7.23 mg/dL [-11.92; -2.55]; P = 0.001 
for superiority). Change from baseline in self-measured 1-h PPG increment for 
the mean over all meals favored faster aspart (ETD -0.25 mmol/L [-0.42; -0.09]); 
-4.58 mg/dL [-7.59; -1.57]; P = 0.003). The overall rate of treatment-emergent 
severe or blood glucose (BG)-confirmed hypoglycemia was statistically 
significantly lower for faster aspart versus IAsp (estimated treatment ratio 
0.81 [95% CI 0.68; 0.97]).
CONCLUSIONS: In combination with insulin degludec, faster aspart provided 
effective overall glycemic control, superior PPG control, and a lower rate of 
severe or BG-confirmed hypoglycemia versus IAsp in adults with type 2 diabetes 
not optimally controlled with a basal-bolus regimen.
