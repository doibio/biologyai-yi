Objective: To determine the pattern of antidiabetic drug use, with a particular 
focus on the metformin dose, among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
in a Japanese working population.Methods: We used an administrative claims 
database linked to yearly health check-up data from large corporations. Data 
were collected for T2DM patients who began using an antidiabetic drug between 
2014 and 2017 (n = 20,401). We evaluated the type of antidiabetic drug used and 
the characteristics of the patients using each type of drug. Among the metformin 
users, we assessed the titration in its dose or treatment during the 12 month 
period after initiation at 3 month intervals.Results: Among 20,401 new 
antidiabetic users, the most frequently used agents during the study period were 
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is; 47.4%), followed by biguanides 
(18.5%) and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is; 6.7%). Most 
patients who initiated with metformin were prescribed 500 mg or less daily 
(72.9%); only 2.0% were prescribed a daily dose of >1000 mg. Moreover, 27% 
remained on the same daily dose during the 1 year follow-up, whereas another 
29.9% discontinued their antidiabetic treatment altogether.Conclusions: A unique 
pattern of prescription was observed amongst Japanese patients with T2DM, and 
DPP4is, rather than metformin, were predominantly used as the first-line 
treatment. SGLT2is were infrequently prescribed. Metformin was prescribed at a 
daily dose of ≤500 mg in many patients. Greater efforts are needed to assess the 
comparative effectiveness of these treatment strategies.
