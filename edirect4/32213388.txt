The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, is a resurgent pest with an 
unexpected response to jinggangmycin (JGM), a broadly applied antibiotic used to 
control rice sheath blight disease. JGM stimulates BPH fecundity, but the 
underlining molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that JGM sprays 
led to increased glucose concentrations, photosynthesis and gene expression, 
specifically Rubsico, sucrose phosphate synthase, invertase 2 (INV2) and INV3 in 
rice plants. JGM sprays led to high-glucose rice plants. Feeding BPH on these 
plants led to increased insulin-like signaling and vitellogenin synthesis. 
Treating BPH with metformin, a gluconeogenesis inhibitor, reversed the influence 
of feeding on high-glucose rice, which was rescued by glucose injections. 
Silencing insulin-like peptide 2 using per os dsRNA led to reduction in juvenile 
hormone (JH) III titers and other fecundity parameters, which were reversed by 
topical applications of the JH analog, methoprene. We infer that JGM acts via 
two broad mechanisms, one through increasing rice plant sugar concentrations and 
a second by upregulating BPH insulin-like signaling.
