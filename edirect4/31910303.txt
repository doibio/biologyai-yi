Treatment options for type 2 diabetes have expanded. While metformin remains the 
first line treatment in most cases, choices for second line treatment now extend 
beyond sulfonylureas and include the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists, and dipeptidyl 
peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure or kidney disease. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis is an uncommon but important side effect; its occurrence 
can be minimised with appropriate patient education and management, especially 
during perioperative periods and times of illness. GLP1 receptor agonists are 
recommended for people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
Gastrointestinal side effects are common but are less prominent with the longer 
acting agents and can be minimised with slow titration of the shorter acting 
agents. DPP4 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, but alogliptin and 
saxagliptin should be used with caution in people with risk factors for heart 
failure. To optimise the management of type 2 diabetes, clinicians need to be 
aware of the pharmacological characteristics of each class of blood 
glucose-lowering medications and of the effect on cardiovascular health and 
renal function, balanced by potential adverse effects. Medications that have 
cardiovascular or renal benefits should be prescribed for patients with these 
comorbidities, and this is reflected in recent international guidelines.
