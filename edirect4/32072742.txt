AIMS: To assess efficacy and safety of fixed-ratio (1:1) combination insulin 
glargine and lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) compared to insulin glargine U100 (iGlar), 
with metformin, in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
inadequately controlled on basal insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 26-week, randomized, open-label study compared 
iGlarLixi to iGlar, both with metformin in adult Japanese patients with T2DM and 
hemoglobin (Hb) A1c ≥7.5% to ≤9.5%, treated with basal insulin and 1 or 2 OADs. 
Five hundred and twelve patients were randomized after a 12-week run-in, when 
iGlar was introduced and/or further titrated and OADs other than metformin were 
stopped. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26.
RESULTS: iGlarLixi (n = 255) demonstrated significantly greater reductions in 
HbA1c (-1.27%) than iGlar (n = 257, -0.53%) (LS mean difference: -0.74%, 
P < .0001) at week 26, confirming the superiority of iGlarLixi. Significantly, 
more iGlarLixi patients reached target HbA1c <7% at week 26 (51.8% vs 16.0% for 
iGlar). iGlarLixi patients lost weight in contrast to iGlar patients (-0.51 kg 
vs +0.55 kg). Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (plasma glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/L) 
was observed in 18.8% of iGlarLixi patients vs 16.7% of iGlar patients. 
iGlarLixi patients had more gastrointestinal-related adverse events than iGlar 
patients (33.3% vs 8.6%), primarily nausea (16.9% vs 0.8%). However, the 
treatment was generally well-tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: A once-daily injection of iGlarLixi with metformin is an effective, 
well-tolerated, and simple therapeutic intervention providing significant 
improvement in glycemic control in Japanese patients with T2DM inadequately 
controlled on basal insulin and up to two OADs. Clinical Trial Number: 
NCT02752412.
