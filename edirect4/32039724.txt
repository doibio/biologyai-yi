BACKGROUND: Metformin is widely used in pregnancy to treat gestational diabetes 
mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Association between PCOS and 
developmental delay in offspring, and larger head circumference of 
metformin-exposed newborns has been reported. The objective of this study was to 
explore whether metformin exposure in utero had any effect on offspring 
cognitive function.
METHOD: The current study is a follow-up of two randomized, placebo-controlled 
studies which were conducted at 11 public hospitals in Norway In the baseline 
studies (conducted in 2000-2003, and 2005-2009), participants were randomized to 
metformin 1700 and 2000 mg/d or placebo from first trimester to delivery. There 
was no intervention in the current study. We invited parents of 292 children to 
give permission for their children to participate; 93 children were included 
(mean age 7.7 years). The follow-up study was conducted in 2014-2016. The 
Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence version III and the 
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children version IV were applied for cognitive 
assessment. Androstenedione and testosterone were measured in maternal blood 
samples at four time-points in pregnancy.
RESULTS: We found no difference in mean, full scale IQ in metformin (100.0 (SD 
13.2)) vs. placebo-exposed (100.9 (SD 10.1)) children. There was an association 
between metformin exposure in utero and borderline intellectual function of 
children (full scale IQ between 70 and 85). Free testosterone index in 
gestational week 19, and androstenedione in gestational week 36 correlated 
positively to full scale IQ.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of long-term effect of metformin on average 
child cognitive function. The increase of borderline intellectual functioning in 
metformin-exposed children must be interpreted with caution due to small sample 
size.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The baseline study was registered on 12 September 2005 at 
the US National Institute of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov) # NCT00159536.
