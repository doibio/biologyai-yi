AIM: To compare weight change in a lifestyle-based weight management programme 
between participants taking weight-gaining, weight-neutral/loss and mixed 
diabetes medications.
METHODS: Electronic health records for individuals (≥ 18 years) with Type 2 
diabetes who had been referred to a non-surgical weight management programme 
between February 2008 and May 2014 were studied. Diabetes medications were 
classified into three categories based on their effect on body weight. In this 
intervention cohort study, weight change was calculated for participants 
attending two or more sessions.
RESULTS: All 998 individuals who took oral diabetes medications and attended two 
or more sessions of weight management were included. Some 59.5% of participants 
were women, and participants had a mean BMI of 41.1 kg/m2 (women) and 40.2 kg/m2 
(men). Of the diabetes medication combinations prescribed, 46.0% were 
weight-neutral/loss, 41.3% mixed and 12.7% weight-gaining. The mean weight 
change for participants on weight-gaining and weight-neutral/loss diabetes 
medications respectively was -2.5 kg [95% confidence interval (CI) -3.2 to -1.8) 
and -3.3 kg (95% CI -3.8 to -2.9) (P = 0.05) for those attending two or more 
sessions (n = 998). Compared with those prescribed weight-neutral medications, 
participants prescribed weight-gaining medication lost 0.86 kg less (95% CI 0.02 
to 1.7; P = 0.045) in a model adjusted for age, sex, BMI and socio-economic 
status.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants on weight-neutral/loss diabetes medications had a 
greater absolute weight loss within a weight management intervention compared 
with those on weight-gaining medications. Diabetes medications should be 
reviewed ahead of planned weight-loss interventions to help ensure maximal 
effectiveness of the intervention.
