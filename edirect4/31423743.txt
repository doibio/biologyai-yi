AIMS: Our previous study indicated that chronic stress caused autophagy 
impairment and subsequent neuron apoptosis in hippocampus. However, the 
mechanism underlying the stress-induced damage to neurons is unclear. In present 
work, we investigated whether stress-level glucocorticoids (GCs) GCs promoted 
PC12 cell damage via AMPK/mTOR signaling-mediated autophagy.
METHODS: Chronic stress-induced PC12 cell injury model was built by treatment 
with high level corticosterone (CORT). Cell injury was evaluated by flow 
cytometry assay and transmission electron microscopy observation.
RESULTS: Autophagy flux was measured based on the changes in LC3-II and P62 
protein expressions, and the color alteration of mCherry-GFP-LC3-II 
transfection. Our results showed that CORT not only increased cell injury and 
apoptosis, but also dysregulated AMPK/mTOR signaling-mediated autophagy flux, as 
indicated by the upregulated expression of LC3-II and P62 proteins, and the 
lowered ration of autolysosomes to autophagosomes. Mechanistically, our results 
demonstrated that autophagy activation by AMPK activator metformin or mTOR 
inhibitor rapamycin obviously promotes cell survival and autophagy flux, 
improved mitochondrial ultrastructure, and reduced expression of Cyt-C and 
caspase-3 in CORT-induced PC12 cells.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that high CORT triggers PC12 cell damage 
through disrupting AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy flux. Targeting this signaling 
may be a promising approach to protect against high CORT and chronic 
stress-induced neuronal impairment.
