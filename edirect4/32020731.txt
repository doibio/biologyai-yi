AIMS/INTRODUCTION: This secondary analysis of the 24-week SMART study examined 
the efficacy of add-on saxagliptin or acarbose to metformin across different 
patient subgroups with type 2 diabetes mellitus, based on baseline 
characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized patients (n = 481) were classified into 
subgroups based on their baseline age (<65, ≥65 years), body mass index (BMI; 
<24, 24-<28, ≥28 kg/m2 ), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; <8%, 8-<9%, 9-<10%, ≥10%) 
and renal function (creatinine clearance 50-<80, ≥80 mL/min). Treatment effects 
on primary outcome (HbA1c) and key secondary outcomes of fasting plasma glucose 
(FPG), 2-h postprandial glucose and homeostatic model assessment of β-cell 
function were assessed across patient subgroups.
RESULTS: For saxagliptin, reductions in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 were 
consistent across different subgroups regardless of baseline age, body mass 
index, HbA1c and renal function (range -0.66 to -1.16%). Saxagliptin was 
associated with consistent reductions in FPG (-0.60 to -1.33 mmol/L) and 2-h 
postprandial glucose (-0.48 to -1.95 mmol/L) across the majority of subgroups 
studied. The efficacy of acarbose on FPG attenuated progressively with 
increasing baseline HbA1c (+0.86 to -1.43 mmol/L); an increase from baseline FPG 
was observed in patients with HbA1c >9%. The effect of acarbose on postprandial 
glucose was also variable (+0.23 to -3.38 mmol/L).
CONCLUSIONS: As add-on to metformin, both saxagliptin and acarbose reduced HbA1c 
regardless of baseline HbA1c, age, body mass index and renal function; however, 
only saxagliptin was effective at a stable glycemic control (FPG and PPG). The 
efficacy of acarbose on FPG and PPG was significantly attenuated in patients 
with higher baseline HbA1c (≥8%).
