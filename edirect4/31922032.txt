AIMS: To assess the dose distribution among users of metformin monotherapy as 
well as the patterns of up-titration following initiation of therapy in people 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adults with T2DM 
in the United Kingdom (UK). Metformin dose distribution was assessed at 0, 6 and 
12 months in people initiating metformin monotherapy (new users) and 
cross-sectionally in people with ongoing metformin monotherapy (prevalent 
users). Patterns and predictors of up-titration were also analysed in new users. 
Dose distributions and treatment patterns were assessed descriptively; 
predictors of up-titration were determined using multivariable logistic 
regressions.
RESULTS: Totals of 6174 new users and 8733 prevalent users were included. New 
users initiated metformin at >0 mg to ≤500 mg (25%), >500 mg to ≤1000 mg (47%), 
>1000 mg to ≤1500 mg (17%) or >1500 mg to ≤2000 mg (12%) daily. This 
distribution did not vary over time. Prevalent users of metformin received doses 
of >0 mg to ≤500 mg (14%), >500 mg to ≤1000 mg (40%), >1000 mg to ≤1500 mg 
(15%), >1500 mg to ≤2000 mg (29%) or >2000 mg (1%) daily. Among new users of 
metformin, 6.7% and 10.8% had been up-titrated at 6 and 12 months, respectively, 
despite the majority having glycated haemoglobin >53 mmol/mol. Predictors of 
up-titration included younger age and higher HbA1c.
CONCLUSIONS: A majority of T2DM patients taking metformin received a dose 
≤1000 mg/day. Up-titration of metformin is infrequent in the first year 
postinitiation.
