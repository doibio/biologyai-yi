BACKGROUND: Third-line antidiabetic drug (ADD) intensification patterns and 
glycemic control post intensification in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have 
not been thoroughly explored in a real-world setting.
OBJECTIVE: This study explored the patterns and risks of third-line ADD 
intensification post second-line ADDs and the probability of desirable glucose 
control over 12 months by third-line ADD classes at the population level.
METHODS: We used the electronic medical records of 255,236 patients with T2DM in 
the USA initiating a second-line ADD post metformin from January 2013 to 
evaluate the rates and risks of third-line intensification and the probability 
of desirable glycemic control with different ADDs after addressing inherent 
heterogeneity using appropriate methodologies.
RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 60 years and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 
8.5% at second-line ADD. Over 209,136 person-years (PY) of follow-up, 40% had 
initiated a third-line ADD at HbA1c of 8.8%. Patients receiving dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
(GLP-1 RAs) as the second-line ADD had a 7% (95% hazard ratio [HR] confidence 
interval [CI] 1.05-1.10) and 28% (95% HR CI 1.24-1.33) higher adjusted risk of 
intensifying with a third-line ADD than did those receiving sulfonylureas as the 
second-line ADD. Those receiving sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors 
(SGLT-2i) as second-line ADD had a 17% (95% HR CI 0.80-0.87) lower risk. The 
adjusted probability of reducing HbA1c by ≥ 1% was similar in those receiving 
third-line sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, GLP-1 RAs, SGLT-2i, and insulin 
(minimum, maximum 95% CI of probability 0.61, 0.68), whereas those receiving 
DPP-4i had a significantly lower probability (0.58; 95% CI 0.56-0.59). 
Similarly, the probability of reducing HbA1c < 7.5% was similar in the 
sulfonylurea, GLP-1 RA, and SGLT-2i groups (minimum, maximum of 95% CI of 
probability 0.41, 0.49), whereas those receiving DPP-4i had a significantly 
lower probability of achieving an HbA1c < 7.5% (0.37; 95% CI 0.36-0.38).
CONCLUSION: This study, based on a large representative cohort of patients with 
T2DM from the USA, suggests the need for revisiting real-world practices in 
choosing therapeutic intensification pathways and a more proactive strategy to 
tackle the persistent risk factor burden in patients with T2DM.
