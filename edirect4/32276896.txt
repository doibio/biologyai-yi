To evaluate the anticancerous effects of different dilutions of metformin were 
evaluated for in vitro anti-cancerous effects, primarily breast cancer cells 
(MCF-7, MDA-MB-231). This prospective experimental study was conducted in 
Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics BMSI in alliance with PCMD. The 
duration of study was from March 2016 to February 2017. For evaluating the 
anticancerous effects of different dilutions of Metformin (0.5μM -100μM) we used 
4 different cancerous cells lines; MCF-7, HT-29, MDA-MB-231 and Hela. For 
assessment of anticancerous effects we used MTT assay by which assessed IC50, 
SI, % viability of all cells and Trypan blue exclusion assay for only MCF-7 cell 
line. The % viability of MCF-7 was significantly decreases (χ2 (2) = 26.48, 
p=<0.001) in dose dependent manner from 99.8±0.2 to 39.71±1.3. For MDA-MB-231% 
viability significantly reduced (χ2 (2) =26.48, p=<0.001) from 99.474± 0.298 to 
51.55±4. However Metformin had statistically no significant dose dependent 
effects on % viability of MCF-10 (χ2 (2) = 11.709, p=0.069). Metformin 
significantly exhibited the anticancerous effects on breast cancerous cells by 
selectively target the cancerous cells without any effects on normal epithelial 
cells of breast.
