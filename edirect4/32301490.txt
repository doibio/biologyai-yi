OBJECTIVE: Even though trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been demonstrated to 
interfere with atherosclerosis and diabetes pathophysiology, the association 
between TMAO and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) has not been 
specifically established in type 2 diabetes (T2D).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the association of plasma TMAO 
concentrations with MACE and all-cause mortality in a single-center prospective 
cohort of consecutively recruited patients with T2D.
RESULTS: The study population consisted in 1463 SURDIENE participants (58% men), 
aged 65 ± 10 years. TMAO concentrations were significantly associated with 
diabetes duration, renal function, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, soluble 
tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) concentrations (R2 = 0.27) and were 
significantly higher in patients on metformin, even after adjustment for 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): 6.7 (8.5) vs 8.5 (13.6) µmol/L, 
respectively (PeGFR-adjusted = 0.0207). During follow-up (median duration 
[interquartile range], 85 [75] months), 403 MACE and 538 deaths were registered. 
MACE-free survival and all-cause mortality were significantly associated with 
the quartile distribution of TMAO concentrations, patients with the highest TMAO 
levels displaying the greatest risk of outcomes (P < 0.0001). In multivariate 
Cox models, compared with patients from the first 3 quartiles, those from the 
fourth quartile of TMAO concentration had an independently increased risk for 
MACE: adjusted hazard ratio (adjHR) 1.32 (1.02-1.70); P = 0.0325. Similarly, 
TMAO was significantly associated with mortality in multivariate analysis: adjHR 
1.75 (1.17-2.09); P = 0.0124, but not when sTNFR1 and angiopoietin like 2 were 
considered: adjHR 1.16 (0.95-1.42); P = 0.1514.
CONCLUSIONS: We revealed an association between higher TMAO concentrations and 
increased risk of MACE and all-cause mortality, thereby opening some avenues on 
the role of dysbiosis in cardiovascular risk, in T2D patients.
