The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of curcumin (Cu) 
on myocardial injury in diabetic cardiomyopathy in vivo and in vitro. Serum and 
myocardial glucose, inflammatory cytokines, and cardiac function indexes of type 
2 diabetes db/db mice were measured. The mechanism of action was confirmed by 
immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blot experiments. H9C2 
cells stimulated by glucose (Glu) were used as cell models in vitro. Cu 
treatment improved glucose tolerance and lipid profile and reduced the 
production of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, Cu decreased the serum 
biochemical indexes. Cu inhibits high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) signaling 
pathway in db/db mice. Cu treatment also significantly inhibited pa-induced 
inflammatory signaling pathway in H9C2 cells. HMGB1 inhibitor or HMGB1 knockdown 
counteracted the effects of Cu on diabetic cardiomyopathy. The present study 
showed the protective effects of Cu on myocardial injury via HMGB1 pathway in 
diabetic cardiomyopathy in vivo and in vitro.
