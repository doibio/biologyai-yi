INTRODUCTION: Basal-bolus (BB) regimens are generally used to intensify basal 
insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) not meeting glycemic 
targets. However, drawbacks include multiple injection burden and risk of weight 
gain and hypoglycemia. A once-daily titratable fixed-ratio combination of 
insulin glargine 100 U/mL and lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) may provide a simple, 
well-tolerated, and efficacious alternative. We compared these treatments in a 
post hoc propensity score matched analysis using randomized trial data.
METHODS: From the LixiLan-L study, 195 patients who had been randomized to 
iGlarLixi were matched for age, sex, race, T2D duration, baseline body mass 
index, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose, insulin dose, and 
metformin use to 195 patients who had been randomized to a BB regimen in the 
GetGoal Duo-2 trial.
RESULTS: At study end, estimated treatment differences for reduction in HbA1c 
and weight change, and ratio of hypoglycemia events per patient-year (BB vs 
iGlarLixi) were - 0.28% (standard error 0.08, P = 0.0002), - 1.32 kg (standard 
error 0.30, P < 0.0001), and 2.85 (P < 0.0001), respectively, all favoring 
iGlarLixi over BB. Also, proportions of patients reaching individual and 
composite goals (HbA1c < 7% [< 53 mmol/mol], no weight gain, and no 
hypoglycemia) were higher in the iGlarLixi compared with the BB treatment group. 
Gastrointestinal side effects were more common with iGlarLixi.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2D inadequately controlled on basal insulin, 
iGlarLixi offers an effective alternative to BB regimen for reducing HbA1c, 
without increased risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain.
