Though affecting many thousands of patients, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic 
fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) should be considered an orphan disease, since the 
cause remains elusive and no treatment is available that can provide complete 
cure. There is reasonable insight into the pathogenesis of signs and symptoms, 
and treatments specifically directed to immunological, inflammatory and 
metabolic processes offer relief to an increasing number of patients. Particular 
attention is given to the importance of co-morbidity requiring appropriate 
therapy. Promising results are obtained by treatment with Metformin, or possibly 
Momordica charantia extract, which will correct insulin resistance, with 
Meldonium improving the transportation of glucose into the mitochondria, with 
sodium dichloroacetate activating pyruvate dehydrogenase, and with nutraceutical 
support reducing oxidative and inflammatory impairment.
