Necroptosis is crucially involved in severe cardiac pathological conditions. 
However, whether necroptosis contributes to age-related intolerance to 
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains elusive. In addition, metformin as a 
potential anti-aging related injury drug, how it interacts with myocardial 
necroptosis is not yet clear. Male C57BL/6 mice at 3-4- (young) and 22-24 months 
of age (aged) and RIPK3-deficient (Ripk3-/- ) mice were used to investigate 
aging-related I/R injury in vivo. Metformin (125 μg/kg, i.p.), necrostatin-1 
(3.5 mg/kg), and adenovirus vector encoding p62-shRNAs (Ad-sh-p62) were used to 
treat aging mice. I/R-induced myocardial necroptosis was exaggerated in aged 
mice, which correlated with autophagy defects characterized by p62 accumulation 
in aged hearts or aged human myocardium. Functionally, blocking autophagic flux 
promoted H/R-evoked cardiomyocyte necroptosis in vitro. We further revealed that 
p62 forms a complex with RIP1-RIP3 (necrosome) and promotes the binding of RIP1 
and RIP3. In mice, necrostatin-1 treatment (a RIP1 inhibitor), RIP3 deficiency, 
and cardiac p62 knockdown in vivo demonstrated that p62-RIP1-RIP3-dependent 
myocardial necroptosis contributes to aging-related myocardial vulnerability to 
I/R injury. Notably, metformin treatment disrupted p62-RIP1-RIP3 complexes and 
effectively repressed I/R-induced necroptosis in aged hearts, ultimately 
reducing mortality in this model. These findings highlight previously unknown 
mechanisms of aging-related myocardial ischemic vulnerability: 
p62-necrosome-dependent necroptosis. Metformin acts as a cardioprotective agent 
that inhibits this unfavorable chain mechanism of aging-related I/R 
susceptibility.
