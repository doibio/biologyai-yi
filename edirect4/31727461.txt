Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disease and pharmacologic 
agents to treat the disease remain lacking for clinical practice. Epidemiologic 
studies have highlighted a negative association between the use of antidiabetic 
drugs, including metformin, and AAA. Metformin is well-known for its blood 
glucose-lowering effect, but its action on both metabolism and inflammatory 
response has led to propose it as a potential therapeutic target in several 
cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on 
the link between metformin and AAA. Based on the known effects of the drug on 
the aortic wall, translational applications and clinical trials investigating 
the interest of metformin in the management of patients with AAA are discussed.
