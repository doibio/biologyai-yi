Glipizide is a second-generation sulfonylurea that is FDA-approved for the 
treatment of adults with diabetes mellitus type 2. It is administered as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise. It can be combined with metformin to reach goal 
HbA1c in patients with not adequate metabolic control in 3 months, despite 
compliance with diet, exercise, and medication. This activity will highlight the 
indications, mechanism of action, contraindications, adverse event profile, and 
potential toxicity of glipizide pertinent for members of the interprofessional 
team in the management care of patients with diabetes using glipizide.
