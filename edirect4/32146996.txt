Extracorporeal modalities have been used for detoxification for decades, with 
hemodialysis the preferred and most commonly used modality. Salicylates, 
lithium, methanol, and ethylene glycol are the most common poisonings treated 
with dialysis. For each of these common poisonings, a description of the 
toxidrome including pharmacokinetics, clinical presentation, an overview of 
treatment, and the role and application of dialysis is outlined. Inhibition of 
alcohol dehydrogenase to prevent the formation of toxic metabolites in methanol 
and ethylene glycol is discussed in detail, including the use of fomepizole and 
ethanol to complement and in some cases prevent the need for hemodialysis. 
Hemodialysis has been attempted to treat many poisonings, often without success. 
A description of EXTRIP (Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning), a 
multidisciplinary project examining the evidence for extracorporeal treatments 
in poisoning, is also described. Recommendations for poisoning with 
acetaminophen, baclofen, barbiturates, carbamazepine, digoxin, metformin, 
phenytoin, thallium, theophylline, tricyclic antidepressants, and valproic acid 
are provided in a comprehensive table.
