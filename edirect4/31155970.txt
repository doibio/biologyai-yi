CONTEXT: The anti-diabetic medicine metformin has been reported as an 
anti-ageing drug candidate as it mimics the benefits of caloric restriction and 
reduces ageing-related oxidative stress in various experimental organisms.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the possible anti-oxidative role of metformin against 
rotenone-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in erythrocytes of Wistar 
rats. Rotenone is a well-known inducer of oxidative stress which leads to a 
cellular redox imbalance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have co-exposed the experimental rats with rotenone 
(2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and metformin (300 mg/kg, orally) for 30 days to investigate 
the protective effects of metformin on various rotenone-induced impaired 
oxidative stress biomarkers in rat erythrocytes.
RESULTS: We found that a significant alleviation in the levels of 
rotenone-induced pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant markers following exposure of 
metformin.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that metformin supplementation 
shows a protective role in against rotenone-induced redox imbalance and 
cytotoxicity in rat erythrocytes.
