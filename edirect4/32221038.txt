Metformin has been studied for its anticancer effects by regulating T cell 
functions. However, the mechanisms through which metformin stimulates the 
differentiation of memory T cells remain unclear. We found that the frequencies 
of memory stem and central memory T cells increased for both in peripheral and 
tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in metformin-treated lung cancer patients 
compared with those not taking the medication. An in vitro assay showed that 
metformin promoted the formation of memory CD8+ T cells and enhanced their 
antiapoptotic abilities. In addition, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
activation decreased microRNA-107 expression, thus enhancing Eomesodermin 
expression, which suppressed the transcription of PDCD1 in metformin-treated 
CD8+ T cells. In the CAR-T cell therapy model, metformin also exhibited 
cytotoxicity-promoting effects that led to decreased tumor growth. Metformin 
could reprogram the differentiation of CD8+ T cells, which may benefit the 
clinical therapy of cancer patients by facilitating long-lasting cytotoxic 
functions.
