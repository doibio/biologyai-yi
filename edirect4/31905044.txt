Bleomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is widely employed in the therapy of 
a range of lymphomas and germ cell tumours. But the therapeutic efficacy of 
bleomycin is limited by development of lung fibrosis. The cytotoxicity of 
bleomycin is mostly ascribed to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, while a 
protective effect of metformin against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis results 
from the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. Since mitochondria and bacteria 
have certain similarities in structure and function, we used Escherichia coli 
for simplification in the present work to investigate the relationship between 
metformin and bleomycin with apparently opposite effects on mitochondrial DNA 
damage. Bleomycin lethality to E. coli was ameliorated by metformin treatment 
accompanying further increase of the level of reactive oxygen species. Catalase 
but not superoxide dismutases attenuated the protective effect of metformin. 
Meanwhile, treatment with hydrogen peroxide enhanced the protection, indicating 
that metformin may protect E. coli from bleomycin-induced bactericide via 
enhanced generation of hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, silibinin, a 
hepatoprotective polyphenolic flavonoid attenuates the cytotoxicity of bleomycin 
to E. coli via enhanced generation of hydrogen peroxide as well. This bacterial 
model in place of mitochondria can provide us with easier screening for the 
molecules with capability of reducing the bleomycin side effect.
