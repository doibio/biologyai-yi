AIMS: In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
inhibitor empagliflozin when given in addition to standard care improved 
cardiovascular (CV) and renal outcomes, and reduced mortality. Trial 
participants were on a variety of glucose-lowering therapies at baseline, some 
of which could potentially affect CV risk. This analysis investigated whether 
the use of background diabetes therapy affected the risk of CV death, 
hospitalizations for heart failure, and progression of chronic kidney disease, 
among patients treated with empagliflozin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg or empagliflozin 25 mg; 
glucose-lowering therapy was to remain unchanged for 12 weeks and then adjusted 
to achieve glycaemic control according to local guidelines. Differences in risk 
of cardio-renal outcomes between empagliflozin and placebo by baseline use of 
metformin, sulphonylurea (SU) and insulin were assessed using a Cox proportional 
hazards model.
RESULTS: Of 7020 eligible patients, 74% were receiving metformin, 43% SU and 48% 
insulin at baseline (each alone or in combination); the most common regimens 
were metformin plus SU (20%) and metformin plus insulin (20%). Empagliflozin 
reduced the risk of CV death irrespective of the use of: metformin [with: hazard 
ratio (HR) 0.71 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.54-0.94); without: 0.46 
(0.32-0.68); Pinteraction = 0.07]; SU [with: HR 0.64 (0.44-0.92); without: 0.61 
(0.46-0.81); Pinteraction = 0.85]; or insulin [with: HR 0.63 (0.46-0.85); 
without: 0.61 (0.44-0.85); Pinteraction = 0.92]. Reductions in three-point major 
adverse CV events, hospitalizations for heart failure, and all-cause mortality 
were consistent across subgroups of baseline therapies. Empagliflozin reduced 
the risks of incident or worsening nephropathy versus placebo irrespective of 
the use of SU or insulin at baseline (Pinteraction > 0.05), but there was a 
greater reduction in this risk for patients not using metformin [HR 0.47 (95% CI 
0.37-0.59)] versus those using metformin [HR 0.68 (95% CI 0.58-0.79)] at 
baseline (Pinteraction = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of empagliflozin to antihyperglycaemic regimens of 
patients with type 2 diabetes and CV disease consistently reduced their risks of 
adverse CV outcomes and mortality irrespective of baseline use of metformin, SU 
or insulin. For chronic kidney disease progression, there may be a larger 
benefit from empagliflozin in those patients who are not using metformin.
