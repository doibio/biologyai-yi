BACKGROUND/AIM: In this study, we evaluated the effect of galloflavin, an 
inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase, in combination with metformin, an 
anti-diabetic drug and inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, on pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored the effect of galloflavin and metformin on 
proliferation and cell death of murine 6606PDA and human MIA PaCa-2 cells.
RESULTS: We observed that monotherapies of galloflavin and metformin both 
inhibit proliferation and induce cancer cell death. Moreover, the combination of 
both agents increased these effects on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. 
The inhibition of proliferation by this combination therapy can be detected 
under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, leading to the assumption that this 
therapy might impair insufficiently supplied solid tumors as well as small 
clusters of cancer cells, e.g. after metastatic dissemination.
CONCLUSION: Galloflavin, especially in combination with metformin, has a strong 
anti-cancerous effect on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells.
