Diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are at an increased risk of complications 
following influenza-virus infection, seasonal vaccination (SV) is recommended. 
However, SV with trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) can induce antibody and 
type-I interferon (IFN) responses, and the effect of anti-DM treatment on these 
responses is incompletely understood. We evaluated the antibody response and 
IFN-α expression in individuals with and without type 2 DM (T2DM) following SV, 
and examined the effects on anti-DM treatment. TIV elicited sero-protection in 
all groups, but antibody persistency was <8 months, except for the antibody 
response to B-antigens in non-DM. T2DM impaired the IgG avidity index, and T2DM 
showed a significantly decreased response against H1N1 and H3N2, in addition to 
delaying and reducing haemagglutination-inhibition persistency against influenza 
B-antigens in DM groups treated with metformin (Met-DM) or glibenclamide 
(GB-DM). Following TIV, the Met-DM and GB-DM groups exhibited reduced IFN-α 
expression upon stimulation with whole- and split-virion influenza vaccines. 
Suppression of IFN-α expression in the Met-DM group was associated with a 
reduction in the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 pathway and impaired 
IgG avidity index. Thus, single-dose TIV each year might not be suitable for 
T2DM. Our data could aid the development of an efficacious influenza vaccine for 
T2DM.
