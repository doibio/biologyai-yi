PURPOSE: Platelet microparticles (PMPs), which are microvesicles shed from 
platelets, participate in inflammation, vascular homeostasis, and thrombosis. 
PMPs are increased in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Agents 
that modulate hormonal aspects of PCOS could affect the levels of PMPs. The aim 
of the present study was to evaluate the effects of oral contraceptives (OCPs), 
antiandrogen, and metformin use for 6 and 12 months on PMPs in normal-weight 
women with PCOS.
METHODS: Forty-five women with PCOS and 13 healthy women were recruited. 
Biochemical, hormonal, and clinical parameters were recorded. Women with PCOS 
received treatment with OCPs, OCPs+antiandrogens, or metformin, depending on 
their main complaint or clinical/biochemical findings. PMPs were measured at 
baseline and after 6 and 12 months.
RESULTS: At baseline, patients with PCOS had higher levels of PMPs than controls 
(p = 0.017), which increased after 6-month treatment with OCPs (p = 0.006). 
Subsequently, they decreased after 12-month treatment (p = 0.046). Metformin had 
no effect on PMP levels.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, PMP levels are increased in PCOS and further increase 
with OCP use. This effect could possibly contribute to the increased risk of 
venous thromboembolism associated with OCP use. However, further studies are 
needed to elucidate the exact role of PMPs in PCOS.
