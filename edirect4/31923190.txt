PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between diabetic mellitus 
(DM) treatment and the incidence rate of endogenous endophthalmitis (EE).
DESIGN: This study used a matched cohort design. We utilized the Longitudinal 
Health Insurance Database to identify outpatients and inpatients who were 
diagnosed with DM and treated with medication from 2000 to 2010.
METHODS: Several factors and different DM medications were also investigated. 
The influence of DM medication on the incidence of EE was examined by using Cox 
proportional hazards regression models, and the hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals were determined.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of EE was lower in DM patients treated with 
medication than in subjects in the control group (P = 0.002). The adjusted 
hazard ratio (AHR) was 0.47-fold lower in the treatment group than in the 
control group (P = 0.004). With respect to DM medication, single-agent therapy 
with insulin, metformin, gliclazide, glimepiride, or repaglinide and combination 
therapy with glimepiride/metformin or repaglinide/metformin were associated with 
decreased AHRs (0.257-0.544, all P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients treated with medication had lower AHRs than those 
in the control group. Further stratification indicated that liver abscess, liver 
disease DM patients who were treated with medication had a lower risk of 
developing EE. Several specific DM medications may decrease the incidence of EE.
