BACKGROUND: There is limited information regarding the optimal third-line 
therapy for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that is inadequately 
controlled using dual combination therapy. This study assessed the efficacy and 
safety of pioglitazone or glimepiride when added to metformin plus alogliptin 
treatment for T2DM.
METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, active-controlled trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02426294) recruited 135 Korean patients with T2DM that 
was inadequately controlled using metformin plus alogliptin. The patients were 
then randomized to also receive pioglitazone (15 mg/day) or glimepiride (2 
mg/day) for a 26-week period, with dose titration was permitted based on the 
investigator's judgement.
RESULTS: Glycosylated hemoglobin levels exhibited similar significant decreases 
in both groups during the treatment period (pioglitazone: -0.81%, P<0.001; 
glimepiride: -1.05%, P<0.001). However, the pioglitazone-treated group exhibited 
significantly higher high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P<0.001) and 
significantly lower homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance values 
(P<0.001). Relative to pioglitazone, adding glimepiride to metformin plus 
alogliptin markedly increased the risk of hypoglycemia (pioglitazone: 1/69 cases 
[1.45%], glimepiride: 14/66 cases [21.21%]; P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Among patients with T2DM inadequately controlled using metformin 
plus alogliptin, the addition of pioglitazone provided comparable glycemic 
control and various benefits (improvements in lipid profiles, insulin 
resistance, and hypoglycemia risk) relative to the addition of glimepiride.
