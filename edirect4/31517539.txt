OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate the antidiabetic effects of 
glycinium [(pyridine-2, 6-dicarboxylato) oxovanadate (V)] complex in type 2 
diabetes rat model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were allocated into 6 groups. Group I, nondiabetic 
rats; Group II, diabetic rats; Group III, diabetic rats receiving an 
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of metformin (45 mg/kg); Groups IV, V and VI 
were diabetic rats receiving i.p. injection of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of the 
complex for 3 weeks, respectively. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, liver 
enzymes, malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), lipid profile, 
and HbA1c were measured.
RESULTS: AST, ALT and GGT activities and MDA levels were increased, while TAC 
was decreased in diabetic animals. Treatment of diabetic rats improved the 
HOMA-IR and returned HbA1c level to the normal value as well as elevated TAC and 
reduced MDA level.
CONCLUSION: We found that the complex possesses antidiabetic properties in 
experimental diabetes.
