Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder affecting 
millions worldwide. Currently, there are only four approved treatments for AD, 
which improve symptoms modestly. AD is believed to be caused by the formation of 
intercellular plaques and intracellular tangles in the brain, but thus far all 
new drugs which target these pathologies have failed clinical trials. New 
research highlights the link between AD and Type II Diabetes (T2D), and some 
believe that AD is actually a brain specific form of it termed Type III Diabetes 
(T3D). Drugs which are currently approved for the treatment of T2D, such as 
metformin, have shown promising results in improving cognitive function and even 
preventing the development of AD in diabetic patients. Recent studies shed light 
on the relationship between the brain and cardiovascular system in which the 
brain and heart communicate with one another via the vasculature to regulate 
fluid and nutrient homeostasis. This line of research reveals how the 
brain-heart axis regulates hypertension and diabetes, both of which can impact 
cognitive function. In this review we survey past and ongoing research and 
clinical trials for AD, and argue that AD is a complex and systemic disorder 
which requires comprehensive approaches beyond the brain for effective 
prevention and/or treatment.
