AIMS: The purpose of this study was to identify the number of pregnancies 
affected by pre-gestational diabetes in the Republic of Ireland; to report on 
pregnancy outcomes and to identify areas for improvement in care delivery and 
clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Healthcare professionals caring for women with pre-gestational diabetes 
during pregnancy were invited to participate in this retrospective study. Data 
pertaining to 185 pregnancies in women attending 15 antenatal centres nationally 
were collected and analysed. Included pregnancies had an estimated date of 
delivery between 1 January and 31 December 2015.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 122 (65.9%) women with Type 1 diabetes and 56 
(30.3%) women with Type 2 diabetes. The remaining 7 (3.8%) pregnancies were to 
women with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) (n = 6) and 
post-transplant diabetes (n = 1). Overall women were poorly prepared for 
pregnancy and lapses in specific areas of service delivery including 
pre-pregnancy care and retinal screening were identified. The majority of 
pregnancies 156 (84.3%) resulted in a live birth. A total of 103 (65.5%) women 
had a caesarean delivery and 58 (36.9%) infants were large for gestational age.
CONCLUSIONS: This audit identifies clear areas for improvement in delivery of 
care for women with diabetes in the Republic of Ireland before and during 
pregnancy.
