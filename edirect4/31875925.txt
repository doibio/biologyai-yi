CONTEXT: Glucose-lowering medications have occasionally been reported to cause 
hyponatremia, but the evidence is scarce.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the association between glucose-lowering medications and 
severe hyponatremia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Subjects hospitalized with a principal 
diagnosis of hyponatremia (n = 14,359) were compared with matched controls 
(n = 57,383). Data were derived by linkage of national population-based 
registers. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for co-medication, 
diseases, previous hospitalizations, and socioeconomic factors was used to 
explore the association between hospitalization for hyponatremia and the use of 
different glucose-lowering medications. Furthermore, newly initiated (≤90 days) 
and ongoing use was investigated separately.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalization due to hyponatremia.
RESULTS: The unadjusted ORs (95% CI) for hospitalization due to hyponatremia 
were 1.41 (1.29-1.54) for insulins, 1.38 (1.27-1.50) for metformin, and 1.22 
(1.07-1.38) for sulfonylureas. However, after adjustment for confounding factors 
the association was consistently reversed. Thus, for any glucose-lowering 
medication the adjusted OR was 0.63 (0.58-0.68). For insulins, metformin and 
sulfonylureas, adjusted ORs (95% CI) were 0.58 (0.52-0.65), 0.81 (0.72-0.90) and 
0.81 (0.69-0.94), respectively. Odds ratios for newly initated medications were 
overall higher while those for ongoing treatment were further decreased. Thus, 
adjusted ORs (95% CI) for ongoing treatment with insulins, metformin, and 
sulfonylureas were 0.54 (0.48-0.61), 0.82 (0.73-0.91) and 0.78 (0.66-0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Glucose-lowering medications did not increase the risk for 
hospitalization due to severe hyponatremia. In fact, the association was inverse 
across all investigated drugs. The association may be mediated by pharmacologic 
mechanisms, but the uniform effects across drug-classes suggest properties of 
the diabetic disease are of importance.
