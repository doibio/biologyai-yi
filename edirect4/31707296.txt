Hypoxia, which frequently reduces the sensitivity to many therapeutic 
interventions, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and phototherapy, has been 
acknowledged as an important reason for poor prognosis. Burgeoning evidences 
have proved that the tumor hypoxia microenvironment can reduce the therapeutic 
effect on tumor through inhibiting the drug efficacy, limiting immune cell 
infiltration of tumors and accelerating tumor recurrence and metastasis. 
However, the relationship between oxygen supply and the proliferation of cancer 
cells is still ambiguous and argued. Different from the current commonly used 
oxygen supply strategies, this study concentrated on the reduction of endogenous 
oxygen consumption. Specifically, a novel photosensitizers (IR780) and metformin 
are packaged in PEG-PCL liposomes. Once such nanoparticles accumulated in tumor 
tissues, the tumor foci were irradiated through 808 nm laser, generated ROS to 
further release metformin and IR780. Metformin can directly inhibit the activity 
of complex Ⅰ in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, thus performed a 
potent inhibitor of cell respiration. After overcoming tumor hypoxia, the 
combination of mitochondria-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermic 
therapy (PTT) via IR780 may achieve superior synergistically therapeutic 
efficacy. Benefit from excellent characteristics of IR780, such synergistic PDT 
PTT with the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration can be monitored through 
near-infrared/photoacoustic dual-modal imaging. Such a conception of reducing 
endogenous oxygen consumption may offer a novel way to solve the important 
puzzles of hypoxia-induced tumor resistance to therapeutic interventions, not 
limited to phototherapy.
