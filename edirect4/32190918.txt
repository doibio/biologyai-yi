Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a health problem that is characterized by body fat 
accumulation, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia; recently, it has 
been demonstrated that MS also damages memory processes. The first-line drug in 
the treatment of MS and type 2 diabetes mellitus is metformin, which is an 
antihyperglycemic agent. This drug has been shown to produce neuroprotection and 
to improve memory processes. However, the mechanism involved in this 
neuroprotection is unknown. A 90-day administration of metformin improved the 
cognitive processes of rats with MS as evaluated by the novel object recognition 
test, and this finding could be explained by an increase in the neuronal spine 
density and spine length. We also found that metformin increased the 
immunoreactivity of synaptophysin, sirtuin-1, AMP-activated protein kinase, and 
brain-derived neuronal factor, which are important plasticity markers. We 
conclude that metformin is an important therapeutic agent that increases neural 
plasticity and protects cognitive processes. The use of this drug is important 
in the minimization of the damage caused by MS.
