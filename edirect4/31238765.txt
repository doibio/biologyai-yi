INTRODUCTION: Eighty-four million patients in the United States have prediabetes 
yet evidence-based interventions to prevent diabetes are infrequently used. The 
concept of prediabetes is contentious, although preventive interventions are 
guideline supported. Team-based care models incorporating pharmacists for 
prediabetes have been proposed; however, pharmacist perception regarding 
prediabetes has not been assessed. This study's objective was to assess 
ambulatory care pharmacists' perception of recommendations for prediabetes.
METHODS: An anonymous survey was electronically distributed through the American 
College of Clinical Pharmacy Ambulatory Care Practice and Research Network. The 
primary outcome was the proportion of respondents who reported supporting 3 main 
recommendations related to prediabetes (ie, screening, evidence-based 
lifestyle-intervention, metformin). The study was approved by the University of 
South Florida Institutional Review Board. Data collection and analysis occurred 
in 2017.
RESULTS: The survey was distributed to approximately 2209 potential 
participants. One hundred thirty-three surveys were completed. The American 
Diabetes Association guideline was the most common primarily supported guideline 
related to prediabetes (89%). Of the respondents, 87% supported all 3 main 
recommendations regarding prediabetes. Qualitative feedback demonstrated the 
full range of opinions; programs for prediabetes, limited intervention for 
prediabetes, and against prediabetes as a concept.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of ambulatory care pharmacists responding supported 
all main recommendations related to prediabetes and therefore may be practicable 
for disseminating diabetes prevention interventions. However, barriers to 
implementation should be expected.
