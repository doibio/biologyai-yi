AIM: Ipragliflozin is a new antidiabetic agent that works through enhancing 
renal glucose excretion. We aim to synthesize evidence from published randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) on the safety and efficacy of ipragliflozin in the 
management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central 
register of clinical trials using relevant keywords. Records were screened for 
eligible studies and data were extracted and synthesized using Review Manager 
Version 5.3 for windows. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: We included 13 RCTs (N=2535 patients) in the final analysis. The 
overall effect estimates favoured ipragliflozin 50mg monotherapy group over 
placebo in terms of: HbA1c (Standardized mean difference (SMD)=-1.20%, 95% 
Confidence interval (95% CI)=[-1.47, -0.93]; p<0.001), fasting plasma glucose 
(SMD=-1.30 mg/dL, 95% CI [-1.93, -0.67]; p<0.001), fasting serum insulin 
(SMD=-1.64 μU/mL, 95% CI [-2.70, -0.59]; p=0.002), and body weight 
(SMD=-0.85 kg, 95% CI [-1.19, -0.51]; p<0.001). Similarly, better glycemic 
control and significant body weight reduction compared to placebo were attained 
in ipragliflozin 50 mg combination with metformin, insulin with/without 
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sulfonylurea, and pioglitazone. Ipragliflozin, 
either alone or in combination, exhibits acceptable safety profile.
CONCLUSION: The presented meta-analysis provides class one evidence that 
ipragliflozin is safe and effective in the management of T2DM either as 
monotherapy or an add-on.
