BACKGROUND: The influence of processes of diabetes care on glycaemic control is 
understudied in primary health care (PHC).
AIM: To explore the influence of lifestyle advice, drug regimen and other 
processes of care on glycaemic control.
SETTING: Johan Heyns Community Health Centre, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study involving 200 participants with type-2 
diabetes, we collected information on sociodemography, comorbidity, processes of 
diabetes care, drug regimen and receipt of lifestyle advice. Anthropometric 
measures and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were also determined.
RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 57.8 years and most were black people (88%), 
females (63%), overweight or obese (94.5%), had diabetes for 10 years (67.9%) 
and hypertension as comorbidity (98%). Most participants received lifestyle 
advice on one of diet, exercise and weight control (67%) and had their blood 
pressure (BP) checked (93%) in the preceding 12 months. However, 2% had any of 
HbA1c, weight, waist circumference or body mass index checked. Glycaemic control 
(HbA1c 7%) was achieved in only 24.5% of participants. Exclusive insulin or oral 
drug was prescribed in 5% and 62% of participants, respectively. Compared to 
insulin monotherapy, participants on combined metformin and insulin or 
metformin, sulphonylurea and insulin were less likely to have glycaemic control. 
Comorbid congestive cardiac failure (CCF) significantly increased the likelihood 
of glycaemic control.
CONCLUSION: There is substantial shortcomings in the implementation of key 
processes of diabetes care and glycaemic control. Strategies are needed to 
prompt and compel healthcare providers to implement evidence-based diabetes 
guidelines during clinic visits in South African PHC.
