AIM: The present study aimed to evaluate the combined effect of both dose and 
duration of metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2D).
METHODS: We recruited 2887 patients with T2D between January 2018 and November 
2019 and categorized them into two groups (metformin and non-metformin users) 
matched for age, mean duration of diabetes, and BMI. We calculated the 
"Metformin Usage Index" (MUI) which was defined as the product of the dose of 
metformin (mg) used and its duration divided by 1000. Vitamin B12 levels were 
compared between the two groups, and its association with MUI was assessed using 
correlation and multistep logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Vitamin B12 levels < 200 pg/ml and between 200 and 300 pg/ml were noted 
among 24.5% and 34.5% metformin users, respectively; this was significantly 
higher than among non-metformin users (17.3% and 22.6%, respectively) 
[P < 0.001]. Overall, a vitamin B12 level < 300 pg/ml was found in 52.2% of the 
subjects. There was a significant association between an MUI > 5 and a high risk 
of vitamin B12 deficiency [P < 0.01]. The highest risk was observed among 
patients with an MUI > 15 [odds ratio (OR) 6.74, 95% CI 4.39-10.4] followed by 
patients with an MUI > 10 (OR 5.12, 95% CI 3.12-8.38).
CONCLUSIONS: The MUI can be employed as a risk assessment tool for evaluation of 
vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with T2D. Further prospective studies are 
required to determine the MUI thresholds in populations with good nutritional 
statuses and low prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency.
