OBJECTIVE: Current research is controversial about whether metformin can improve 
the survival rate of patients with colon cancer. Therefore, we conducted a 
meta-analysis to identify the association between metformin and the survival 
rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with type II diabetes.
METHODS: We conducted a search in databases including Pubmed, EMBASE and 
Cochrane Library. All articles were published in the last decade, and the 
quality of each study was evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Odds ratios 
(ORs) and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study were 
calculated and summary relative risk estimates with corresponding 95% CIs were 
generated using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias 
were assessed.
RESULTS: Ten articles were included in this meta-analysis. The included articles 
were all cohort studies. In a pooled analysis of all studies, metformin using 
was associated with increased overall survival (OS) rate (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47 
to 0.63) and cancer-specific survival (CS) rate (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.82) 
of CRC patients with diabetes. We found that the effect of metformin is 
associated with geographical region through subgroup meta-analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin using was associated with an increased OS rate and CS 
rate of colorectal cancer.
