Excessive lipid deposition is a hallmark of NAFLD. Although much has been 
learned about the enzymes and metabolites involved in NAFLD, few studies have 
focused on the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hepatic lipid 
accumulation. Here, using in vitro and in vivo models of NAFLD, we found that 
the lncRNA Gm15622 is highly expressed in the liver of obese mice fed a HFD and 
in murine liver (AML-12) cells treated with free fatty acids. Investigating the 
molecular mechanism in the liver-enriched expression of Gm15622 and its effects 
on lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and on NAFLD pathogenesis, we found that 
Gm15622 acts as a sponge for the microRNA miR-742-3p. This sponging activity 
increased the expression of the transcriptional regulator SREBP-1c and promoted 
lipid accumulation in the liver of the HFD mice and AML-12 cells. Moreover, 
further results indicated that metformin suppresses Gm15622 and alleviates 
NAFLD-associated lipid deposition in mice. In conclusion, we have identified an 
lncRNA Gm15622/miR-742-3p/SREBP-1c regulatory circuit associated with NAFLD in 
mice, a finding that significantly advances our insight into how lipid 
metabolism and accumulation are altered in this metabolic disorder. Our results 
also suggest that Gm15622 may be a potential therapeutic target for managing 
NAFLD.
