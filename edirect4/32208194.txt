OBJECTIVE: Metformin, a common drug for diabetes treatment has shown promising 
characteristics against wide types of cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo 
in the context of halted growth of cancer. But, it was unclear whether cancer 
stem cells are affected by the metformin treatment. Here, we attempt to find out 
the effect of metformin on cancer stem cell marker CD44 and stemness related 
transcription factors including OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, c-Myc and KLF4.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prepared single-cell suspension from primary oral 
tumors and subjected the cells to grow in vitro. Gene expression of 
transcription factors was assessed by real-time PCR. Further, the expression of 
CD44 was checked by flow Cytometry.
RESULTS: Metformin showed downregulation in the gene expressions of stemness 
related transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, c-Myc, and KLF4 in a 
dose-dependent as well as time-dependent manner. Also, the most effective 
concentration of metformin at 25 μM was found to decrease the expression of CD44 
in the primary tumor cells in a time-dependent manner.
CONCLUSION: Continuous treatment of lower concentrations of metformin decreases 
the expression of cancer stem cell markers at the transcription level and cancer 
stem cell-surface marker CD44 in primary oral cancer cells.
