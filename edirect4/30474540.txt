BACKGROUND: The emergence of infectious diseases and its resistance to approved 
drugs is a global threat to human health. The incidence of infectious diseases 
is increasing day by day and expected to rise exponentially in next 2 decades. 
Thus, there is a need for new treatment modalities for the treatment of 
microbial infections.
METHODS: Thus, in the current investigation, we have explored the existing drugs 
[metformin (Anti-diabetic), propranolol (Anti-hypertensive) and amitriptyline 
(antidepressant)] for treatment of infectious diseases.
RESULTS: An in-silico result of current investigation has shown the good 
interaction of metformin, propranolol, and amitriptyline towards various targets 
(Beta-lactamase, Penicillin-binding proteins, Staphylokinase protein, 
Oxidoreductase protein, etc.) of gram positive and gram negative bacteria as 
that of internal ligand. Further, in-vitro results have shown that the 
antibacterial activity of metformin, propranolol, and amitriptyline against 
Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
CONCLUSION: The parameters such as Microtiter assay: percentage growth 
retardation and bacterial growth kinetics, Minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC), Post-antibiotic assay and Biofilm formation have indicated the 
antibacterial potential of metformin, propranolol, and amitriptyline. However, 
before starting a clinical trial, complete safety and efficacy profile of drugs 
in the treatment of infectious diseases should be investigated.
