In both estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor-positive (ER+/PR+) human breast 
cancer and in ER+/PR+ cancers in the methylnitrosourea (MNU)-induced rat model, 
short-term modulation of proliferation in early cancers predicts 
preventive/therapeutic efficacy. We determined the effects of known 
effective/ineffective chemopreventive agents on proliferative index (PI) in both 
rat mammary epithelium and small cancers. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were 
treated with MNU at 50 days of age. Five days later, the rats were treated with 
the individual compounds for a period of 14 days. At that time, normal mammary 
tissue from the inguinal gland area was surgically removed. After removal, the 
rats remained on the agents for an additional 5 months. This cancer prevention 
study confirmed our prior results of striking efficacy with tamoxifen, vorozole, 
Targretin, and gefitinib, and no efficacy with metformin, naproxen, and Lipitor. 
Employing a separate group of rats, the effects of short-term (7 days) drug 
exposure on small palpable cancers were examined. The PI in both small mammary 
cancers and in normal epithelium from control rats was >12%. In agreement with 
the cancer multiplicity data, tamoxifen, vorozole, gefitinib, and Targretin all 
strongly inhibited proliferation (>65%; P < 0.025) in the normal mammary 
epithelium. The ineffective agents metformin, naproxen, and Lipitor minimally 
affected PI. In the small cancers, tamoxifen, vorozole, and Targretin all 
reduced the PI, while metformin and Lipitor failed to do so. Thus, short-term 
changes in the PI in either normal mammary epithelium or small cancers 
correlated with long-term preventive efficacy in the MNU-induced rat model.
