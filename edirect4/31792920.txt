BACKGROUND: The hyperglycemic condition in diabetes induces cellular senescence 
in vascular endothelial cells and causes cardiovascular complications. 
Alpha-mangostin is a xanthone found in Garcinia mangostana, and has shown 
protective effects in metabolic syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, the anti-senescence effects of alpha-mangostin in the 
hyperglycemic condition are investigated.
METHODS: HUVECs were incubated with high glucose for 6 days and co-treated by 
metformin or alpha-mangostin. After 6 days, cell viability, reactive oxygen 
species, the percentage of senescent cells, secretory interleukin-6, and the 
expression of SIRT1, AMPK, p53 and p21 were measured.
RESULTS: High glucose (60 mM) significantly decreased cellular viability and 
increased reactive oxygen species and cellular senescence through the reduction 
of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Moreover, high glucose 
increased the protein levels of p53, acetyl-p53 and p21. The protein levels of 
SIRT1 and total AMPK were decreased by high glucose. High glucose increased the 
secretion of IL-6. Alpha-mangostin (1.25 μM) and metformin (50 μM) reversed the 
toxic effects of high glucose in HUVECs.
CONCLUSION: These results show that alpha-mangostin, similar to metformin, has 
anti-senescence effects in high-glucose conditions, which is probably due to its 
antioxidant activity through the SIRT1 pathway. Alpha-mangostin has previously 
shown anti-inflammatory effects and metabolic status improvement in animal and 
clinical studies. Therefore, this natural agent can be considered as a 
supplement to prevent vascular complications caused by high glucose in patients 
with diabetes. Graphical abstract.
