Ethoxysanguinarine (Eth) is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid extracted from 
Macleaya cordata (Willd) R. Br. It possesses antibacterial and antiviral 
activities and offers therapeutic benefits for the treatment of respiratory 
syndrome virus-induced cytopathic effects. However, the effect of Eth on human 
tumors and its pharmacological effects remain to be elucidated, together with 
its cellular target. Here, we examined the effects of Eth on breast cancer (BC) 
cells. We found that at low doses, Eth strongly inhibited the viability of BC 
cell lines and induced autophagy. Mechanistic studies showed that Eth induced 
autophagy by upregulating the activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK). The AMPK inhibitor compound C significantly attenuated Eth-induced 
autophagy and inhibited proliferation. Meanwhile, the AMPK activator metformin 
significantly enhanced Eth-induced autophagy and inhibited proliferation. 
Computational docking and affinity assays showed that Eth directly interacted 
with the allosteric drug and metabolite site of AMPK to stabilize its 
activation. AMPK was less activated in tumor samples compared to normal breast 
tissues and was inversely associated with the prognosis of the patients. 
Moreover, Eth exhibited potent anti-BC activity in nude mice and favorable 
pharmacokinetics in rats. These characteristics render Eth as a promising 
candidate drug for further development and for designing new effective AMPK 
activators.
