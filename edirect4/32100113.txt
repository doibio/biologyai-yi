PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of metformin as a treatment for the mortality of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: We searched Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Clinical Trials.gov 
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the Cochrane Collaboration Library from 
inception to November 2019. To analyze the relationship between metformin and 
the overall mortality, specific mortality, and sex differences in CRC patients 
with T2DM, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used. 
Egger's test and Begg's test were used to assess publication bias.
RESULTS: We included 8 cohort studies in our meta-analysis. CRC patients with 
T2DM treated with metformin had a lower overall mortality than CRC patients with 
T2DM who did not receive metformin (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.95). There was no 
significant difference in CRC-specific mortality between CRC patients with T2DM 
who used metformin and those who did not (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.65-1.08). However, 
females had a lower CRC-specific mortality among CRC patients with T2DM than 
males (HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.41-0.97).
CONCLUSION: Metformin reduced the overall mortality of CRC patients with T2DM. 
Moreover, female CRC patients with T2DM using metformin had lower CRC-specific 
mortality than male CRC patients with T2DM.
