OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like peptide-1 is a nutrient-sensitive hormone secreted from 
enteroendocrine L cells within the small and large bowel. Although GLP-1 levels 
rise rapidly in response to food ingestion, the greatest density of L cells is 
localized to the distal small bowel and colon. Here, we assessed the importance 
of the distal gut in the acute L cell response to diverse secretagogues.
METHODS: Circulating levels of glucose and plasma GLP-1 were measured in 
response to the administration of L cell secretagogues in wild-type mice and in 
mice with (1) genetic reduction of Gcg expression throughout the small bowel and 
large bowel (GcgGut-/-) and (2) selective reduction of Gcg expression in the 
distal gut (GcgDistalGut-/-).
RESULTS: The acute GLP-1 response to olive oil or arginine administration was 
markedly diminished in GcgGut-/- but preserved in GcgDistalGut-/- mice. In 
contrast, the increase in plasma GLP-1 levels following the administration of 
the GPR119 agonist AR231453, or the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonist 
LY2112688, was markedly diminished in the GcgDistalGut-/- mice. The GLP-1 
response to LPS was also markedly attenuated in the GcgGut-/- mice and remained 
submaximal in the GcgDistalGut-/- mice. Doses of metformin sufficient to lower 
glucose and increase GLP-1 levels in the GcgGut+/+ mice retained their 
glucoregulatory activity, yet they failed to increase GLP-1 levels in the 
GcgGut-/- mice. Surprisingly, the actions of metformin to increase plasma GLP-1 
levels were substantially attenuated in the GcgDistalGut-/- mice.
CONCLUSION: These findings further establish the importance of the proximal gut 
for the acute response to nutrient-related GLP-1 secretagogues. In contrast, we 
identify essential contributions of the distal gut to (i) the rapid induction of 
circulating GLP-1 levels in response to pharmacological selective agonism of 
G-protein-coupled receptors, (ii) the increased GLP-1 levels following the 
activation of Toll-Like Receptors with LPS, and iii) the acute GLP-1 response to 
metformin. Collectively, these results reveal that distal gut Gcg + endocrine 
cells are rapid responders to structurally and functionally diverse GLP-1 
secretagogues.
