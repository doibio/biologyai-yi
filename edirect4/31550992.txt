BACKGROUND: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors as the second medication to be started, after 
metformin, for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 inhibitors may cause volume, blood pressure, and electrolyte 
disturbances; consequently, frequent monitoring and adjustments to other 
diabetes, blood pressure, and/or diuretic medications may be necessary.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an interprofessional clinic 
model partnering nephrologists and pharmacists for the initiation and monitoring 
of SGLT2 inhibitors.
METHODS: A clinical pharmacist was embedded within the nephrology clinic to 
provide patient education, telephone follow-up, and to work collaboratively with 
the nephrologists. Diabetes, hypertension, and diuretic regimens were adjusted 
as needed after empagliflozin initiation. Diabetes regimens were adjusted to 
adhere to the 2019 ADA guidelines that promote agents with CKD and 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease benefit.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients were initiated on empagliflozin during the study 
period. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) improved (mean % change -12% ± 
61%); the mean percentage change was greater in patients with a higher baseline 
UACR. The mean change in hemoglobin A1c was 0.3% ± 0.6%. Common adverse 
reactions were observed and improved over time; no serious adverse drug 
reactions occurred. Finally, empagliflozin initiation necessitated adjustments 
to diabetes, hypertension, and diuretic regimens in almost all patients (n = 13, 
93%).
CONCLUSION: The implementation of an innovative, interprofessional care model 
within a nephrology clinic for the initiation and monitoring of empagliflozin in 
patients with DKD demonstrated clinical benefit with minimal safety concerns.
