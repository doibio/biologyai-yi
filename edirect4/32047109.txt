Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, the senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP), and impaired autophagy all are general features of senescent 
cells. However, the cross-talk among these events and processes is not fully 
understood. Here, using NIH3T3 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide stress, we 
show that stress-induced DNA damage provokes the SASP largely via cytosolic 
chromatin fragment (CCF) formation, which activates a cascade comprising 
cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), NF-κB, 
and SASP, and that autolysosomal function inhibits this cascade. We found that 
CCFs accumulate in senescent cells with activated cGAS-STING-NF-κB signaling, 
promoting SASP and cellular senescence. We also present evidence that the 
persistent accumulation of CCFs in prematurely senescent cells is partially 
associated with a defect in DNA-degrading activity in autolysosomes and reduced 
abundance of activated DNase 2α. Intriguingly, we found that metformin- or 
rapamycin-induced activation of autophagy significantly lessened the size and 
levels of CCFs and repressed the activation of the cGAS-STING-NF-κB-SASP cascade 
and cellular senescence. These effects of autophagy activators indicated that 
autolysosomal function contributes to CCF clearance and SASP suppression, 
further supported by the fact that the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 blocked 
the role of autophagy-mediated CCF clearance and senescence repression.
