OBJECTIVE: Impaired insulin sensitivity is associated with hyperfiltration 
(i.e., elevated glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) in adolescents with type 2 
diabetes (T2D) and adults with prediabetes. Yet, these relationships are based 
on studies that relied on estimated GFR (eGFR), estimates of insulin 
sensitivity, or both. We aimed to verify the relationship between insulin 
sensitivity and renal hemodynamic function by gold standard methods in adults 
with T2D.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Insulin sensitivity was assessed by 
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (M value) (glucose infusion rate in 
mg/kglean/min) and renal hemodynamic function by urinary inulin (GFR) and 
para-aminohippuric acid (effective renal plasma flow [ERPF]) clearances in 
participants with T2D without overt kidney disease. Filtration fraction (FF) 
(GFR/ERPF) was calculated. Relationships between insulin sensitivity and renal 
hemodynamic parameters were examined by multivariable linear regression. Renal 
hemodynamic parameters were examined across tertiles of M values.
RESULTS: We tested 44 adults with T2D, of whom 77% were male, with mean ± SD age 
63 ± 7 years, BMI 31.2 ± 4.0 kg/m2, and HbA1c 7.4 ± 0.6%. Average GFR was 110 ± 
26 mL/min, with an FF of 22.1 ± 2.8% and median 24-h urinary albumin excretion 
of 11.3 mg (interquartile range 5.8-17.0). Average M value was 5.6 ± 2.9 
mg/kglean/min. Insulin sensitivity inversely correlated with GFR (r = -0.44, P < 
0.01) and FF (r = -0.40, P < 0.01), and these associations remained significant 
after multivariable adjustments for age, sex, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor 
use, and HbA1c. In addition, GFR, FF, and urinary albumin excretion were highest 
in the participants in the lowest M value tertile.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we demonstrate that impaired insulin 
sensitivity is associated with intrarenal hemodynamic dysfunction by gold 
standard techniques in adults with T2D treated with metformin monotherapy.
