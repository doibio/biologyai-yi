BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth is increasing in prevalence. Diabetes 
screening is recommended for at-risk youth but best-practice strategies for 
management of pediatric prediabetes are unknown. This study leverages a 
pediatric prediabetes clinic to assess identification of high-risk patients, the 
rate of clinic follow-up and progression to T2D in youth over time.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of children referred to a single center for 
evaluation of prediabetes over a 3-year period. Measurements included hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1C) and oral glucose tolerance testing. Patients were classified as 
normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or T2D based on 
2019 American Diabetes Association criteria. Patients classified as IGT/T2D were 
prescribed metformin.
RESULTS: Of the 254 patients included; 25.6% had IGT and 6.7% had T2D. The 
IGT/T2D groups were older and more obese than the NGT group. There was a 
moderate correlation between HbA1C and fasting glucose (r = 0.59, P < 0.001); 
HbA1C and 2-hour glucose (r = 0.63, P < 0.001). Over the 3-year study, 52 of 82 
patients with IGT/T2D (63%) returned for follow-up. Four patients regained NGT; 
3 of those had isolated impaired fasting glucose (100 to 102 mg/dL). Three 
patients (4.6%) progressed from IGT to T2D over an average of 13 ± 6.2 months. 
In those patients, body mass index had increased 1.7 ± 2.3 kg/m2 from baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: A pediatric prediabetes clinic may allow for identification of 
high-risk youth but lost to follow-up rates are high. Continued weight gain is a 
risk factor for progression to T2D and effective weight management programs are 
needed.
