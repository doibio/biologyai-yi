BACKGROUND: Gentamicin is widely used as an antibiotic for the treatment of gram 
negative infections. Evidences indicates that oxidative stress is involved in 
gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. In Ayurvedic medicine, Punica granatum Linn. 
is considered as 'a pharmacy unto itself". It has been claimed in traditional 
literature, to treat various kidney ailments due to its antioxidant potential.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the possible mechanism of action of methanolic extract of 
P.granatum leaves (MPGL) in exerting a protective effect on gentamicin-induced 
nephropathy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Animals were administered with gentamicin (80 mg/kg/day 
i.m.) and simultaneously with MPGL (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg p.o.) or metformin 
(100 mg/kg p.o.) for 8 days. A satellite group was employed in order to check 
for reversibility of nephrotoxic effects post discontinuation of gentamicin 
administration. At the end of the study, all the rats were sacrificed and 
serum-urine parameters were investigated. Antioxidant enzymes and tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined in the kidney tissues along with 
histopathological examination of kidneys.
RESULTS: Increase in serum creatinine, urea, TNF-α, lipid peroxidation along 
with fall in the antioxidant enzymes activity and degeneration of tubules, 
arterioles as revealed by histopathological examination confirmed the 
manifestation of nephrotoxicity caused due to gentamicin. Simultaneous 
administration of MPGL and gentamicin protected kidneys against nephrotoxic 
effects of gentamicin as evidenced from normalization of renal function 
parameters and amelioration of histopathological changes.
CONCLUSION: Data suggests that MPGL attenuated oxidative stress associated renal 
injury by preserving antioxidant enzymes, reducing lipid peroxidation and 
inhibiting inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α.
