We aimed to estimate colorectal cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) using metformin. Patients with colorectal cancer and diabetes 
from 2000 to 2012 were identified form Lithuanian Cancer Registry and the 
National Health Insurance Fund database. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) 
for colorectal cancers as a ratio of observed number of cancer cases in people 
with diabetes to the expected number of cancer cases in the underlying general 
population was calculated. We analysed 111 109 patients with diabetes. Overall, 
1213 colorectal cancers were observed versus 954.91 expected within a period of 
observation entailing an SIR of 1.27 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.34]. 
Significantly higher risk of colorectal cancer was found both in male and female 
patients with diabetes in all age groups. Higher risk was found for both colon 
and rectum cancers 1.36 (95% CI: 1.27-1.46) and 1.11 (95% CI: 1.01-1.22), 
respectively. There were no differences in risk over time since initial diabetes 
diagnosis. Never-users of metformin had twice higher risk of colorectal cancer 
compared to general population (SIR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.95-2.35). Among metformin 
users, risk was lover (SIR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.36-1.58) and colorectal cancer risk 
decreased with increasing cumulative dose of metformin (P < 0.001). Patients 
with T2DM had increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with the general 
Lithuanian population. Decreasing colorectal cancer risk with increasing 
cumulative dose of metformin indicates that metformin may be a protective agent 
for colorectal cancer development.
