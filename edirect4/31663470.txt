Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a public health burden and its co-existence 
with hypertension is long established in the context of the metabolic syndrome. 
Both DM and hypertension are major risk factors, for end-stage renal disease, 
cardiovascular events and mortality. Strict blood pressure (BP) control in 
diabetics has been associated with a cardiovascular and renal risk decrease. 
Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) in the proximal 
tubule is a relatively novel class of agents for the treatment of type 2 DM. 
Inhibition of SGLT-2 co-transporter combines proximal tubule diuretic and 
osmotic diuretic action leading to glucose reabsorption reduction and mild 
natriuretic and diuretic effects. On this basis, several studies showed that 
treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors can effectively decrease hyperglycemia but also 
increase BP control and reduce renal outcomes and cardiovascular mortality. 
Based on such evidence, the recent guidelines for the management of type 2 DM 
now suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors should be preferred among oral agents in 
combination with metformin, in patients at increased cardiovascular risk, 
chronic kidney disease or heart failure. This review summarizes the existing 
data from studies evaluating the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on BP, and its 
potential value for cardio- and nephroprotection.
