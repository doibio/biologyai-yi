We evaluated the effect of antihyperglycemic therapy on the survival of patients 
with lung cancer (LC). The analysis included patients with LC and concomitant 
type 2 diabetes. 15,929 patients were classified into five groups: metformin 
users, insulin users, metformin and insulin users, sulphonylurea users and 
non-diabetic group. A multivariate analysis showed that exposure to either 
metformin or to insulin was associated with a lower risk of LC-specific 
mortality, and this approached statistical significance (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-92 
for metformin and HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-95 for insulin). When deaths from all 
causes were considered, only metformin exposure was associated with a 
significantly lower risk of death (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.92). Users of 
sulphonylurea were at a higher risk of LC-specific and overall mortality (HRs 
1.19, 95% CI 0.99-1.43 and 1.22, 95% CI 1.03-1.45). Our study shows a positive 
effect of metformin on the survival of patients with LC. Moreover, our results 
show that exposure to insulin was associated with a lower risk of LC-specific 
mortality, but not with deaths from all causes. The study results suggested that 
users of sulphonylurea may be at a higher risk of LC-specific and overall 
mortality.
