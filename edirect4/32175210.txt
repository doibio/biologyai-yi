The overall goal in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is 
remission. However, the effects of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor 
(SGLT2i) on remission of T2DM are unknown. We herein report a case involving an 
overweight 43-year-old man who completely recovered from T2DM after SGLT2i 
therapy (dapagliflozin at 5 mg/day). In the pretreatment period, he had a body 
mass index (BMI) of 26.0 kg/m2, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentration of 10.3%, 
advanced insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, and fatty liver. 
Eighteen months after comprehensive therapy, including the administration of an 
SGLT2i and metformin, his BMI had decreased to 21.3 kg/m2 and his glycemic 
control was almost normal (HbA1c of 5.3%) despite discontinuation of all 
hypoglycemic medications. This report is the first to propose the usefulness of 
the combination therapy of SGLT2i and metformin for achieving normal body weight 
and remission of newly diagnosed T2DM in a real-world clinical situation.
