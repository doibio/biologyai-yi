Objective: To assess patient-reported outcomes after two years of use of dual 
oral anti-diabetes drug (OAD) therapy in elderly people (≥65 years) with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from Italy under real-life settings.Methods: 3-AGE was 
a prospective, non-interventional study in elderly people with T2DM inadequately 
controlled on metformin monotherapy (defined as glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] 
7.0-9.0%), in whom a second OAD was prescribed. Primary endpoint was to assess 
the physical and psychological symptoms associated with T2DM from baseline to 24 
months using the Diabetes Symptom Check List revised (DSC-R) questionnaire. 
Patient's quality of life and health status, treatment satisfaction, consumption 
of healthcare resources, and physician satisfaction with treatment were also 
assessed (secondary endpoints) using validated questionnaires. Additionally, 
safety and clinical characteristics were also evaluated.Results: The mean age of 
the study population (N = 860) was 71.5 ± 5.2 years. Addition of a second OAD 
significantly (p < .0001) reduced the DSC-R score from baseline (0.73 ± 0.68) to 
both Months 12 and 24 (0.63 ± 0.59 and 0.61 ± 0.56), and HbA1c from baseline 
(7.72% ± 0.54%) to Month 12 (6.95% ± 0.82%). Adding a second OAD improved 
quality of life and health status (baseline, 71.31 ± 15.16 to Month 12, 
74.49 ± 13.64; p < .0001), patient's treatment satisfaction (p < .0001), and 
consumption of healthcare resources per patient. Physicians expressed good 
satisfaction with patients' treatment (across efficacy, tolerability and 
compliance domains) at Month 12. Overall, 32 adverse reactions (in 24 patients) 
and four hypoglycemic episodes were reported during the 24 months.Conclusion: 
Addition of a second OAD improved physical and psychological symptoms associated 
with T2DM and was well tolerated in elderly people under real-life settings.
