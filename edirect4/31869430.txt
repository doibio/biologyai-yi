In gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), women are unable to compensate for the 
increased insulin resistance during pregnancy. Data are limited regarding the 
pharmacodynamic effects of metformin and glyburide during pregnancy. This study 
characterized insulin sensitivity (SI), β-cell responsivity, and disposition 
index (DI) in women with GDM utilizing a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) before 
and during treatment with glyburide monotherapy (GLY, n = 38), metformin 
monotherapy (MET, n = 34), or GLY and MET combination therapy (COMBO; n = 36). 
GLY significantly decreased dynamic β-cell responsivity (31%). MET and COMBO 
significantly increased SI (121% and 83%, respectively). Whereas GLY, MET, and 
COMBO improved DI, metformin (MET and COMBO) demonstrated a larger increase in 
DI (P = 0.05) and a larger decrease in MMTT peak glucose concentrations 
(P = 0.03) than subjects taking only GLY. Maximizing SI with MET followed by 
increasing β-cell responsivity with GLY or supplementing with insulin might be a 
more optimal strategy for GDM management than monotherapy.
