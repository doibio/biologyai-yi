BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obstruction of the nasoenteral tube is one of the 
complications of enteral nutrition therapy, and its causes and frequency of 
occurrence are not well understood. To evaluate the causes of enteral nutrition 
feeding tube obstruction. To study the time elapsed between the beginning of the 
nutrition therapy and the obstruction of the tube.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 1170 patients aged 18 
years or older who were hospitalized at Sírio-Libanês Hospital between January 
2015 and October 2017, and who were undergoing enteral nutrition therapy 
delivered using an infusion pump through a nasogastric or nasoenteral tube. The 
study population included 683 (58%) men and 487 (42%) women. The median age was 
79 years. Of these, 1084 patients received enteral nutrition and medication 
through the feeding tube, and 86 received medication alone. Variables 
investigated as causes of feeding tube obstruction were the administration of 
medication through the tube, type of diet, and use of symbiotics.
RESULTS: Obstruction rates were 4% for up to 40 days of observation and 8% for 
the total observation time. The time for obstruction of 10% of the tubes in 
patients receiving rivaroxaban, linagliptin, metformin, and nystatin was 16, 19, 
20, and 28 days, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of nasoenteral tube obstruction (odds ratio) was the 
combination of metformin (2.0), nystatin (3.1), linagliptin (4.3), rivaroxaban 
(2.4), and a high-protein diet (1.9). Overall, proper tube care and strict 
compliance with tubal drug delivery guidelines can result in low tube 
obstruction rates.
