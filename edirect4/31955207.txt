OBJECTIVE: The extent to which infertility and pregnancy independently increase 
risk of diabetes and subclinical atherosclerosis is not known.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of Diabetes 
Prevention Program (DPP) and the DPP Outcomes Study over a 15-year period. We 
included women who answered questions about gravidity and infertility at 
baseline (n = 2085). Infertility was defined as > 1 year of unsuccessful 
attempts to conceive; thus, women could have histories of infertility as well as 
pregnancy. Risk of diabetes associated with gravidity and infertility was 
calculated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, 
race/ethnicity, treatment arm, body mass index, and pregnancy during the study. 
Among women who underwent assessment of coronary artery calcification (CAC) (n = 
1337), odds of CAC were calculated using logistic regression models with similar 
covariates.
RESULTS: Among premenopausal women (n = 1075), women with histories of pregnancy 
and infertility (n = 147; hazard ratio [HR] 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.30, 2.49) and women with histories of pregnancy without infertility (n = 736; 
HR 1.49; 95% CI 1.15, 1.93) had greater diabetes risk than nulligravid women 
without infertility (n = 173). Premenopausal nulligravid women with histories of 
infertility had a non-significant elevation in risk, although the number of 
these women was small (n = 19; HR 1.63; 95% CI 0.88, 3.03). Associations were 
not observed among postmenopausal women (n = 1010). No associations were 
observed between infertility or pregnancy with CAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy, particularly combined with a history of infertility, 
confers increased risk of diabetes but not CAC among glucose-intolerant 
premenopausal women.
