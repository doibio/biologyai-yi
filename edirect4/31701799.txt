The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of adding metformin 
or spironolactone to rosiglitazone in women with polycystic ovary syndrome 
(PCOS). This is a prospective non-randomized study in a tertiary care with at in 
a tertiary care endocrine clinic. Women (n = 138) diagnosed with PCOS on the 
basis of Rotterdam criteria 2003 were categorized into three groups on the basis 
of drug intake as - rosiglitazone (R), rosiglitazone with spironolactone 
(R + S), and rosiglitazone with metformin (R + M). Clinical, biochemical, 
hormonal, and insulin sensitivity parameters were assessed at baseline and after 
six months of follow up. There was a significant improvement in number of 
menstrual cycles per year and Ferriman Gallwey (FG) score in all three groups 
after 6 months. Plasma insulin (0, 2 h), HOMA-IR and serum total testosterone 
levels decreased after six months in all the three groups. The inter group 
comparison showed higher efficacy of R + S in improving hyperandrogenism whereas 
R + M was most effective in decreasing body weight and plasma insulin levels 
compared to R and R + S (p<.05). Treatment of women with PCOS using 
rosiglitazone alone and in combination with spironolactone or metformin is safe 
and efficacious with limited adverse events however randomized trials with 
longer duration of follow up are warranted.
