OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effect and partial mechanism of 
electroacupuncture (EA) for patients with insulin resistance (IR) polycystic 
ovary syndrome (PCOS).
METHODS: Seventy patients with IR-PCOS were randomly divided into an EA group 
(36 cases, 5 cases dropped off) and a medication group (34 cases, 4 cases 
dropped off). The patients in the medication group were treated with oral 
administration of metformin hydrochloride, 500 mg each time, twice a day. The 
patients in the EA group were treated with EA (continuous wave, 2 Hz of 
frequency) at Zusanli (ST 36), Zhongwan (CV 12), Qihai (CV 6), Yishu (EX-B 3), 
Shenshu (BL 23), Pishu (BL 20), Ciliao (BL 32) for 30 min, three times a week. 
One menstrual cycle or 4 weeks were taken as a course of treatment, and 3 
continuous courses were given. The follow-up was 3 months. The lipid metabolism 
indexes of triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), homeostasis model 
assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and testosterone (T) in serum were 
compared before and after treatment, and the clinical effects of the two groups 
were evaluated during the follow-up.
RESULTS: The total effective rate was 67.7% (21/31) in the EA group and 60.0% 
(18/30) in the medication group, with no significant difference between the two 
groups (P>0.05). After treatment, the levels of serum T, HOMA-IR, LDL, TG and TC 
were decreased significantly in the two groups (P<0.01, P<0.05), and HDL was 
increased significantly (P<0.01); the levels of TC in the EA group after 
treatment was lower than that in the medication group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: EA may adjust some dyslipidemia in patients to correct IR and 
improve endocrine disorder of PCOS, which had superior/similar effects to 
metformin.
