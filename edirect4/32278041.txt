BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver 
disease worldwide. One treatment is the use of metformin but its efficacy 
remains to be established.
OBJECTIVE: The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide a 
more robust examination of the evidence for the effectiveness of metformin for 
treating non-diabetic NAFLD patients.
METHODS: An extensive literature search was undertaken using online databases 
(PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library) to detect 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of metformin 
administration on liver enzymes and body composition in non-diabetic NAFLD 
patients up to 10 December 2019. A random-effects or fixed-effect models were 
performed to pool weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI).
RESULTS: Six RCTs involving 307 individuals were included to the present 
meta-analysis. Compared to controls, metformin significantly reduced body mass 
index (BMI) (WMD: -0.77 kg/m2, 95 % CI = [-1.46, -0.07], P = 0.03, I2 = 0.0 %) 
and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (WMD: -5.94 U/L, 95 % CI = [-11.51, 
-0.38], P = 0.03, I2 = 67.6 %). Also, body weight (WMD: -2.70 kg, 95 % CI = 
[-5.49, 0.09], P = 0.05, I2 = 33.7%) was marginally significant and serum 
alanine transaminase (ALT) (WMD: -5.04 U/L, 95 % CI = [-13.92, 3.84], P = 0.26, 
I2 = 60.9 %) was not statistically significant affected by metformin 
administration. There was no evidence of publication bias.
CONCLUSION: In summary, the present study emphasizes the clinical importance of 
metformin administration for improving liver function and body composition in 
non-diabetic NAFLD patients. Moreover, the further large-scale and well-designed 
RCTs are required to confirm these findings.
