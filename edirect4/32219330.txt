CONTEXT: Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency are not only linked to hematological, 
neurological, and cardiovascular diseases, but are also associated with insulin 
resistance. Metformin can decrease vitamin B12 and folate concentrations.
OBJECTIVE: To examine (1) effects of short-term metformin treatment on serum 
holotranscobalamin (holoTC) and folate and (2) their association with insulin 
sensitivity in recent-onset type 2 diabetes.
DESIGN: This cross-sectional analysis comprised patients (known disease duration 
<12 months) on metformin monotherapy (MET, n = 123, 81 males, 53 ± 12 years) or 
nonpharmacological treatment (NPT, n = 126, 77 males, 54 ± 11 years) of the 
German Diabetes Study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HoloTC (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), cobalamin, 
and folate (electrochemiluminescence); beta-cell function and whole-body insulin 
sensitivity, measured during fasting (HOMA-B, HOMA-IR) and intravenous glucose 
tolerance tests combined with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp tests.
RESULTS: HoloTC (105.4 [82.4, 128.3] vs 97 [79.7, 121.9] pmol/L) and folate 
concentrations (13.4 [9.3, 19.3] vs 12.7 [9.3, 22.0] nmol/L) were similar in 
both groups. Overall, holoTC was not associated with fasting or 
glucose-stimulated beta-cell function and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. 
Cobalamin measurements yielded similar results in representative subgroups. In 
NPT but not MET, folate levels were inversely correlated with HOMA-IR 
(r = -0.239, P = .007). Folate levels did not relate to insulin sensitivity or 
insulin secretion in the whole cohort and in each group separately after 
adjustment for age, body mass index, and sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin does not affect circulating holoTC and folate 
concentrations in recent-onset type 2 diabetes, rendering monitoring of vitamin 
B12 and folate dispensable, at least during the first 6 months after diagnosis 
or initiation of metformin.
