AIM: To assess the comparative effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 
(SGLT2) inhibitors, sulphonylureas (SUs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) 
inhibitors on cardiometabolic risk factors in routine care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using primary care data on 10 631 new users of SUs, SGLT2 
inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors added to metformin, obtained from the UK Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink, we created propensity-score matched cohorts and used 
linear mixed models to describe changes in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), systolic blood pressure (BP) and 
body mass index (BMI) over 96 weeks.
RESULTS: HbA1c levels fell substantially after treatment intensification for all 
drugs: mean change at week 12: SGLT2 inhibitors: -15.2 mmol/mol (95% confidence 
interval [CI] -16.9, -13.5); SUs: -14.3 mmol/mol (95% CI -15.5, -13.2); and 
DPP-4 inhibitors: -11.9 mmol/mol (95% CI -13.1, -10.6). Systolic BP fell for 
SGLT2 inhibitor users throughout follow-up, but not for DPP-4 inhibitor or SU 
users: mean change at week 12: SGLT2 inhibitors: -2.3 mmHg (95% CI -3.8, -0.8); 
SUs: -0.8 mmHg (95% CI -1.9, +0.4); and DPP-4 inhibitors: -0.9 mmHg (95% CI 
-2.1,+0.2). BMI decreased for SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP-4 inhibitor users, but not 
SU users: mean change at week 12: SGLT2 inhibitors: -0.7 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.9, 
-0.5); SUs: 0.0 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.3, +0.2); and DPP-4 inhibitors: -0.3 kg/m2 (95% 
CI -0.5, -0.1). eGFR fell at 12 weeks for SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP-4 inhibitor 
users. At 60 weeks, the fall in eGFR from baseline was similar for each drug 
class.
CONCLUSIONS: In routine care, SGLT2 inhibitors had greater effects on 
cardiometabolic risk factors than SUs. Routine care data closely replicated the 
effects of diabetes drugs on physiological variables measured in clinical 
trials.
