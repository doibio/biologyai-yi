Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder 
characterized by myotonia and muscle weakness. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cancer 
have been shown to be part of the DM1 phenotype. Metformin, a well-established 
agent for the management of T2D, is thought to have cancer-preventive effects in 
the general population. In our study, we aimed to assess the association between 
T2D, metformin use and the risk of cancer in DM1 patients. We identified a 
cohort of 913 DM1 patients and an age-, sex- and clinic-matched cohort of 12,318 
DM1-free controls from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a large 
primary care records database. We used Cox regression models to assess cancer 
risk in T2D patients who were metformin users or nonusers compared to patients 
without T2D. Separate analyses were conducted for DM1 patients and controls. T2D 
was more prevalent in DM1 than in controls (8% vs. 3%, p < 0.0001). DM1 patients 
with T2D, compared to those without T2D, were more likely to develop cancer 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 3.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18-10.97; p = 0.02), 
but not if they were treated with metformin (HR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.06-3.35; p = 
0.42). Among controls, we observed no significant associations between T2D and 
cancer risk in either users or nonusers of Metformin (HR = 1.28, 95% CI = 
0.91-1.79; p = 0.16 and HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.72-1.79; p = 0.59, respectively). 
These results show an association between T2D and cancer risk in DM1 patients 
and may provide new insights into the possible benefits of Metformin use in DM1.
