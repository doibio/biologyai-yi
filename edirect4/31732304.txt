OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the healing effect of metformin on 
noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) by measuring audiological, biochemical and 
histological parameters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 rats were divided into four groups (Group 1: Noise, 
Group 2: Noise + Metformin, Grup 3: Metformin, Grup 4: Control). Broadband noise 
was applied to Group 1 and Group 2 after basal measurements. Measuring 
audiological (distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and Auditory 
Brainstem Response (ABR)), biochemical (total antioxidant status (TAS), total 
oxidant status (TOS), oxidative status index (OSI), DNA damage, IL-1 beta, IL-6, 
TNF alfa, HSF-1 and COX-2) and histological parameters.
RESULTS: Group 2 had significant decreases in ABR thresholds on day 7 and day 14 
compared to day 1. DPOAE values of Group 2 on the 7th and 14th days were 
significantly higher than the post-noise levels. DNA damage, TOS and OSI values 
of Group 1 were significantly higher than the other groups. The Cox-2 value of 
Group 1 was higher than all other groups. The HSF-1 value of Group 2 was 
significantly higher than that of Group 1. In terms of IL-1 Beta, IL-6 and 
TNF-alpha values, there was no significant difference between groups 2, 3 and 4 
and these values were significantly lower than group 1. In histopathological 
results of our study, no significant difference was found between the groups 
being exposed to noise and the control group.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that early period of Metformin treatment has 
therapeutic effect on NIHL.
