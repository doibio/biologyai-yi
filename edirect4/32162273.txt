Increased hepatic glucose output, the primary liver dysregulation associated 
with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is not directly or effectively targeted by 
the currently available classes of glucose-lowering medications except 
metformin. This unmet need might be addressed through activation of a specific 
enzyme-member of the hexokinase family, namely glucokinase (GK). GK serves as a 
"glucose-sensor" or "glucose receptor" in pancreatic cells, eliciting 
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and as glucose "gate-keeper" in 
hepatocytes, promoting hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis and 
storage. GK activation by small molecules present an alternative approach to 
restore/improve glycaemic control in patients with T2DM. GK activators 
(GKAs) may increase insulin secretion from the pancreas and promote glycogen 
synthesis in the liver, and hence reduce hepatic glucose output. Despite several 
setbacks in their development, interest in the GKA class has been renewed, 
particularly since the introduction of a novel, dual-acting full GKA, 
dorzagliatin, and a novel hepatoselective molecule, TTP399. In this article we 
provide an overview of the role, efficacy, safety and future developments of 
GKAs in the management of T2DM.
