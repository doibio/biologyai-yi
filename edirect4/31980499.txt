This study's primary objective was to fully characterize the pharmacokinetics of 
metformin in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) versus 
nonpregnant controls. Steady-state oral metformin pharmacokinetics in pregnant 
women with GDM receiving either metformin monotherapy (n = 24) or a combination 
with glyburide (n = 30) as well as in nonpregnant women with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) (n = 24) were determined utilizing noncompartmental techniques. 
Maternal and umbilical cord blood samples were collected at delivery from 38 
women. With both 500- and 1000-mg doses, metformin bioavailability, volume of 
distribution beta (V β ), clearance, and renal clearance were significantly 
increased during pregnancy. In addition, in the women receiving metformin 500 
mg, significantly higher metformin apparent oral clearance (CL/F) (27%), 
weight-adjusted renal secretion clearance (64%), and apparent oral volume of 
distribution beta (V β /F) (33%) were seen during pregnancy. Creatinine 
clearance was significantly higher during pregnancy. Increasing metformin dose 
from 500 to 1000 mg orally twice daily significantly increased V β /F by 28%, 
weight-adjusted V β /F by 32% and CL/F by 25%, and weight-adjusted CL/F by 28% 
during pregnancy. Mean metformin umbilical cord arterial-to-venous plasma 
concentration ratio was 1.0 ± 0.1, venous umbilical cord-to-maternal 
concentration ratio was 1.4 ± 0.5, and arterial umbilical cord-to-maternal 
concentration ratio was 1.5 ± 0.5. Systemic exposure after a 500-mg dose of 
metformin was lower during pregnancy compared with the nonpregnant women with 
T2DM. However, in patients receiving metformin 1000 mg, changes in estimated 
bioavailability during pregnancy offset the changes in clearance leading to no 
significant change in CL/F with the higher dose. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: 
Gestational diabetes mellitus complicates 5%-13% of pregnancies and is often 
treated with metformin. Pregnant women undergo physiological changes that alter 
drug disposition. Preliminary data suggest that pregnancy lowers metformin 
concentrations, potentially affecting efficacy and safety. This study 
definitively describes pregnancy's effects on metformin pharmacokinetics and 
expands the mechanistic understanding of pharmacokinetic changes across the 
dosage range. Here we report the nonlinearity of metformin pharmacokinetics and 
the increase in bioavailability, clearance, renal clearance, and volume of 
distribution during pregnancy.
