Metformin is widely used as a frontline medicine of type-II diabetes. Frequent 
overdose side-effects and their consequent adversative need to be reduced. The 
novel source of marine hydrozoa, Thyroscyphus ramosus derived chitosan combined 
metformin drug was administrated to evaluate the antidiabetic potential on a 
high-fat diet (HFD) with streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. The primary 
analysis of In vitro antioxidant activity was tested for various solvent 
dissolved chitosan. Based on their IC50 dose values, CsnAA was chosen for 
further experiments. The chitosan was combined with metformin by sonication and 
confirmed through XRD, FTIR and SEM analysis. The enhanced activity was observed 
in 100 mg/kg metformin combined with CSN500mg/kg. The level of serum bilirubin, 
total protein, SGH, liver glycogen, Glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6- 
phosphatase values were significantly similar to metformin 300 mg/kg treated 
group. With this beneficiary, the novel chitosan was recommended to administrate 
with metformin to improve the drug efficacy and reduction of overdose lethal 
effects.
