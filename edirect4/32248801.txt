BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder affecting 
about 10% of women in reproductive age and associated with a variety of hormonal 
abnormalities, including hyperandrogenemia and infertility, all of which could 
lead to PCOS. Statins were previously introduced as a therapeutic option for 
reducing testosterone levels in women with PCOS, either alone or in combination. 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different statins 
alone or in combination with metformin in reducing testosterone levels in women 
with PCOS.
METHODS: Medline, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for studies that 
investigated the efficacy of statins, metformin, spironolactone, or combined 
oral contraceptives (COCs), individually or in combination, in reducing the 
testosterone level in patients with PCOS. The search was limited to randomized 
clinical trials and conducted according to the preferred reporting items for 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses - extension statement for network 
meta-analyses (PRISMA-NMA). The quality of included studies was assessed using 
the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias (RoB) assessment tool. A frequentist 
network meta-analysis using random-effects models was used to assess the 
efficacy in reducing testosterone level and were expressed as odds ratios (OR) 
and 95% credible interval (95%Crl). All statistical analyses were performed 
using netmeta Version 1.0 on R statistical package.
RESULT: Nine RCTs involving 613 patients were included. Atorvastatin showed 
greater reduction in testosterone level compared to COC (MD -2.78, 95%CrI -3.60, 
-1.97), spironolactone plus metformin (MD -2.83, 95%CrI -3.80, -1.87), 
simvastatin (MD -2.88, 95%CrI -3.85, -1.92), spironolactone (MD -2.90, 95%CI 
-3.77, -2.02), simvastatin plus metformin (MD -2.93, 95%CrI -3.79, -2.06), 
metformin (MD -2.97, 95%CrI -3.69, -2.25), lifestyle modification (MD -3.02, 
95%CrI -3.87, -2.18), and placebo (MD -3.04, 95%CrI -3.56, -2.53).
CONCLUSION: Atorvastatin was found to be more effective than the other 
management strategies in reducing the total testosterone level for patients with 
PCOS. Future studies should focus on the optimal dose.
