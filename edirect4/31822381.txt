Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) frequently fail to achieve glycemic goals 
and have excess cardiovascular risk and premature death. Adjunctive agents may 
play a role in reducing morbidity, mortality, and the adverse sequelae of 
insulin treatment. A surge in type 2 diabetes drug development has revealed 
agents with benefits beyond glucose lowering, including cardiovascular risk 
reduction. Could these benefits translate to T1D? Specific trials for T1D 
demonstrate substantial hemoglobin (Hb)A1c reductions with sodium glucose 
cotransporter inhibitors (SGLTis) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)1 agonists, and 
modest improvements with metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i), 
and pramlintide. Studies exploring cardiovascular risk reduction are warranted. 
This review synthesizes the emerging literature for researchers and clinicians 
treating people with T1D. Challenges in T1D research are discussed.
