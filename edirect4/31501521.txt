Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most lethal urological tumors. Using 
sunitinib to improve the survival has become the first-line therapy for 
metastatic RCC patients. However, the occurrence of sunitinib resistance in the 
clinical application has curtailed its efficacy. Here we found TR4 nuclear 
receptor might alter the sunitinib resistance to RCC via altering the 
TR4/lncTASR/AXL signaling. Mechanism dissection revealed that TR4 could modulate 
lncTASR (ENST00000600671.1) expression via transcriptional regulation, which 
might then increase AXL protein expression via enhancing the stability of AXL 
mRNA to increase the sunitinib resistance in RCC. Human clinical surveys also 
linked the expression of TR4, lncTASR, and AXL to the RCC survival, and results 
from multiple RCC cell lines revealed that targeting this newly identified 
TR4-mediated signaling with small molecules, including tretinoin, metformin, or 
TR4-shRNAs, all led to increase the sunitinib sensitivity to better suppress the 
RCC progression, and our preclinical study using the in vivo mouse model further 
proved tretinoin had a better synergistic effect to increase sunitinib 
sensitivity to suppress RCC progression. Future successful clinical trials may 
help in the development of a novel therapy to better suppress the RCC 
progression.
