Previous randomized and observational studies on the efficacy of metformin in 
pregnancy to reduce incident gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in women at 
high risk (obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS], or pregestational insulin 
resistance) have been conflicting and several groups are planning further 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to answer this question conclusively. This 
work assesses the efficacy of metformin in pregnancy to avert one 
outcome-incident GDM in women at high risk. We included RCTs comparing metformin 
with usual care or placebo controls in terms of incident GDM and recruiting 
women at high risk during early pregnancy. Eleven eligible trials enrolled 2370 
adult women whose intervention arm consisted of metformin started at conception 
or before 20 weeks of gestation. Risk of GDM was similar in intervention 
compared with controls (risk ratio [RR] 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.85-1.24). The data were of sufficient quality meeting the criteria for 
consistency and directness. We conclude that metformin does not contribute to 
averting the GDM outcome in women at high risk when initiated in pregnancy. The 
evidence provided by this synthesis affirms that further broad clinical trials 
investigating this question are no longer needed.
