BACKGROUND: Metformin is the drug of first choice in people newly diagnosed with 
type 2 diabetes. Most patients respond to metformin monotherapy, but many others 
remain uncontrolled even at maximal doses. Although non-adherence is a major 
contributor to non-response, genetic polymorphisms of organic cation 
transporters play an important role in clinical response. We hypothesize that 
genetic variants are partly responsible for non-response.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the allele and genotype frequencies of 
three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; ATM rs11212617, SLC22A1 rs594709 
and SLC47A1 rs2289669) most commonly associated with failure to respond to 
metformin.
SETTING: Ten primary health care facilities in the North Central Regional Health 
Authority region of Trinidad.
PATIENTS: The study population will include 216 patients with diabetes adherent 
to metformin monotherapy for at least three months.
METHODS: Following a 12-hour overnight fast, blood samples will be taken to 
measure fasting insulin and HbA1c. DNA would be isolated and PCR will be used to 
determine the allele and genotype frequencies of these three SNPs in adherent 
diabetic patients. DNA samples will be stored for future sequencing of these 
three genes to determine whether other, possibly novel, mutations are associated 
with poor metformin response in Trinidad.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study will highlight the prevalence of these 
polymorphisms in our population. Should an association be found between the 
polymorphisms tested and glycemic control in adherent patients on metformin 
monotherapy, this will have implications for further research on medication 
initiation in newly diagnosed patients with diabetes in Trinidad.
