Metformin is a safe, effective and useful drug for glucose management in 
patients with diabetes. However in recent years, more attention has been paid to 
the possibility of using metformin as an anti-aging drug. It was shown to 
significantly increase the lifespan in some model organisms and delay the onset 
of age-associated declines. The current review summarizes advances in clinical 
research on the potential role of metformin in the field of lifespan and 
healthspan extension. Growing amounts of evidence from clinical trials suggest 
that metformin can effectively reduce the risk of many age-related diseases and 
conditions, including cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, chronic 
inflammation and frailty. Metformin also holds promise as a drug that could be 
repurposed for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy for certain types of cancer. 
Moreover, metformin induces autophagy by activation of AMPK and can thus be 
potentially used to promote heathspan by hormesis-like mechanisms. Although 
long-term intake of metformin is associated with low risk of adverse events, 
well-designed clinical trials are still required to uncover the potential use of 
this drug as a geroprotector.
