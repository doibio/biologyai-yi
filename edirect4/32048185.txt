INTRODUCTION: In general, women more often experience metformin-associated 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) than men.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess whether sex differences in reported ADRs for 
metformin are observed at different times after initiation, and to explore their 
concurrence with sex differences in the dose of metformin over time. This may 
guide future studies in assessing the involved mechanisms of sex differences in 
metformin-associated ADRs and may guide sex-specific management of ADRs in 
clinical practice.
METHODS: This study has a longitudinal design using data about patients 
initiating metformin collected by the Dutch National Pharmacovigilance Center 
Lareb through their Intensive Monitoring program. Patients were asked to 
complete a web-based questionnaire six times after initiation (i.e., at 2 weeks, 
6 weeks and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months). The outcome variables were the 
proportion of patients reporting any ADR (primary) and the dose of metformin 
(secondary). Sex differences in the proportions of ADRs and in the dose were 
tested at each assessment using Pearson Chi-Squared tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum 
tests, respectively. Using Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing, a p 
value < 0.01 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The number of included patients was 1712 (40.9% women). Women reported 
an ADR more often than men, which was statistically significant at the 
assessment at 2 weeks (34% vs 25%, p < 0.001), and 6 weeks (37% vs 28%, 
p = 0.001) after initiation. In general, women were reported to be prescribed a 
lower dose than men, which became statistically significant at the 9-month 
assessment (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Sex differences in reported ADRs were seen in the first weeks after 
metformin initiation, whereas statistically significant differences in 
self-reported prescribed dosing were observed after several months. Patients, in 
particular women, might benefit from being prescribed lower metformin doses at 
treatment initiation.
