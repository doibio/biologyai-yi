OBJECTIVE: To explore potential synergy in effectiveness between metformin and 
everolimus, 2 inhibitors of the mTOR pathway, for neuroendocrine tumours (NET).
DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic or 
lung NETs treated by everolimus were stratified in to those without diabetes, 
those with diabetes and without metformin, and those with diabetes with 
metformin. The primary endpoint was the median progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: A total of 213 patients were included, 165 of which were non-diabetic; 
among diabetic patients, 19 were treated with metformin and 29 with others 
anti-diabetic drugs. No significant difference in median PFS [95%CI] was found 
between the three groups: 10.05 months [8.27;11.83] for non-diabetic patients, 
15.24 [19.88;49.43] for diabetic w/metformin, and 9.03 months [4.01;14.06] for 
diabetic w/o metformin group. In univariate analysis, factors significantly 
associated with longer PFS was a functioning NET, a number of metastatic 
sites<3, the absence of lung metastasis, and an uptake on Octreoscan®, but not 
the absence of metformin use; only uptake on Octreoscan® remained significant in 
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with the literature, we did not find a synergy between 
everolimus and metformin in NET. Prospective studies are underway to improve the 
comprehension of the potential synergy regarding population and tumour type.
