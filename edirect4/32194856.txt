Over a decade of research has confirmed the critical role of cancer stem-like 
cells (CSCs) in tumor initiation, chemoresistance, and metastasis. Increasingly, 
CSC hierarchies have begun to be defined with some recurring themes. This 
includes evidence that these hierarchies are 'flexible,' with both cell state 
transitions and dedifferentiation events possible. These findings pose 
therapeutic hurdles and opportunities. Here, we review cancer stem cell 
hierarchies and their interactions with the tumor microenvironment. We also 
discuss the current therapeutic approaches designed to target CSC hierarchies 
and initial clinical trial results for CSC targeting agents. While cancer stem 
cell targeted therapies are still in their infancy, we are beginning to see 
encouraging results that suggest a positive outlook for CSC-targeting 
approaches.
