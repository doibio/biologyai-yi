CONTEXT: Increased prevalence of asthma has been reported from epidemiological 
studies in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate respiratory function in women with PCOS compared with 
controls in a clinical setting.
DESIGN: An 8-year clinical follow-up study including self-reported asthma 
diagnoses and spirometry of women with PCOS randomized to metformin or placebo 
during pregnancy in the original studies (the Pilot and the PregMet-study), 
compared with matched controls from a population-based cohort study (The HUNT 
Study).
SETTING: Secondary and tertiary care centers.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 145 women with PCOS (54% of original cohort) were 
matched 1:3 to controls, on gender, age, and smoking-status.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported doctor-diagnosed asthma (DDA), 
percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second of 
expiration (FEV1 % predicted), percentage of predicted forced vital capacity 
(FVC % predicted).
RESULTS: Women with PCOS reported more DDA compared with controls (19% vs 9%; P 
< 0.01). Spirometry indicated a combined obstructive (FEV1 % predicted, 93.7 vs 
102.0; P < 0.01) and restrictive (FVC % predicted, 94.5 vs 103.7; P < 0.01) 
respiratory impairment in PCOS compared with controls. Metformin in pregnancy 
did not affect respiratory function at follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Women with PCOS reported higher prevalence of DDA compared with 
controls matched for age and smoking status. In addition, respiratory function 
was decreased, with both obstructive and restrictive components. Further insight 
to the underlying pathogenesis of these observations is needed.
