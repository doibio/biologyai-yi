Edible Sonchus oleraceus Linn is a medicinal plant with many bioactivities such 
as anti-diabetic activity and anti-inflammatory activity. However, the main 
bioactive components such as polyphenols in S. oleraceus Linn are poorly 
absorbed in gastrointestinal tract and rapidly metabolized. Thereby, a 
self-emulsifying delivery system containing S. oleraceus Linn extracts (SSEDDS) 
was introduced to evade these problems. Herein, the anti-inflammatory effect of 
SSEDDS on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was investigated. The plasma 
glucose level was increased and plasma insulin level was decreased in diabetic 
rats. The levels of NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the liver were significantly 
improved in diabetic rats (p < 0.05). Conversely, daily fed diabetic rats with 
100, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day of SSEDS and 1 mg/kg/day metformin for 4 weeks, 
significantly (p < 0.05) restored all the above mentioned parameters to near 
normal levels. The immuno-histochemical studies confirmed the anti-inflammatory 
effects of SSEDDS.
