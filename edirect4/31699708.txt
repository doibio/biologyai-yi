Recent observational studies suggest that bisphosphonates (BP) and antidiabetic 
drugs are associated with colorectal cancer risk reduction. Hence, we evaluated 
the colorectal cancer preventive effects of BPs (zometa and fosamax), 
individually and when combined with metformin, in azoxymethane-induced rat colon 
cancer model. Rat (30/group) were randomized and treated subcutaneously with 
azoxymethane to induce colorectal cancer. Dietary intervention with zometa or 
fosamax (0, 20, or 100 ppm) or metformin (1,000 ppm) or the combinations 
(zometa/fosamax 20 ppm plus metformin 1,000 ppm) began 4 weeks after 
azoxymethane treatment, at premalignant lesions stage. Rats were killed 40 weeks 
post drug intervention to assess colorectal cancer preventive efficacy. Dietary 
zometa (20 ppm) inhibited noninvasive adenocarcinomas multiplicity by 37% (P < 
0.03) when compared with control diet fed group. Fosamax at 20 ppm and 100 ppm 
significantly reduced adenocarcinoma incidence (P < 0.005) and inhibited the 
noninvasive adenocarcinoma multiplicities by 43.8% (P < 0.009) and 60.8% (P < 
0.004), respectively, compared with the group fed control diet. At 1,000 ppm 
dose, metformin failed to suppress colon adenocarcinoma formation. However, the 
lower dose combinations of zometa or fosamax with metformin resulted in 
significant inhibition of noninvasive adenocarcinoma by 48% (P < 0.006) and 64% 
(P < 0.0002), and invasive adenocarcinoma by 49% (P < 0.0005) and 38% (P < 
0.006), respectively. Biomarker analysis of combination drug-treated tumors 
showed a decrease in cell proliferation with increased apoptosis when compared 
with untreated tumors. Overall, our results suggest that the combination of low 
doses of zometa or fosamax with metformin showed synergistic effect and 
significantly inhibited colon adenocarcinoma incidence and multiplicity.
