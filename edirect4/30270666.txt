Objective: The aim was to evaluate if maternal treatment with metformin (MET) 
during pregnancy and lactation could be safe for metabolic and cardiovascular 
parameters of adult male and female offspring.Materials and methods: Wistar 
female rats were treated with MET (293 mg/kg/d) or tap water, by gavage during 
gestation (METG or CTRG) or gestation and lactation (METGL or CTRGL).Results: At 
75 days of life, male and female MET offspring presented similar blood pressure 
when compared with their CTR. The heart rate of female METGL was higher than in 
the CTRGL. The insulin sensitivity, basal glycaemia, body weight, Lee index of 
obesity, plasmatic concentration of triglycerides, total cholesterol and fat 
acid of male and female MET were similar to CTR groups. Lower fat pad deposition 
was observed in female METG and METGL.Conclusion: MET exposure during 
gestational and lactation does not program cardiovascular and metabolic 
alterations in adult offspring life.
