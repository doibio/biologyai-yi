BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis is needed to comprehensively consolidate findings 
from the influence of metformin on IGF-1 levels. The present study was conducted 
with the objective to accurately evaluate the influence of metformin intake on 
IGF-1 levels via a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search was carried out in PubMed/MEDLINE, 
Web of Science, SCOPUS and Embase from inception until June 2019. Weighted mean 
difference (WMD) with the 95 % CI were applied for estimating the effects of 
metformin on serum IGF-1 levels.
RESULTS: 11 studies involving a total of 569 individuals reported changes in 
IGF-1 plasma concentrations as an outcome measure. Pooled results demonstrated 
an overall non-significant decline in IGF-1 following metformin intake (WMD: 
-8.292 ng/ml, 95 % CI: -20.248, 3.664, p = 0.174) with heterogeneity among (p = 
0.000,I2 = 87.1 %). The subgroup analyses displayed that intervention duration 
<12 weeks on children (WMD:-55.402 ng/ml, 95 % CI: -79.845, -30.960, I2 = 0.0 %) 
significantly reduced IGF-1. Moreover, in age 18 < years older metformin intake 
(WMD: 15.125 ng/ml, 95 % CI: 5.522, 24.729, I2 = 92.5 %) significantly increased 
IGF-1 than 18 ≤ years older (WMD:-1.038 ng/ml, 95 % CI: -3.578,1.502,I2 = 78.0 
%). Following dose-response evaluation, metformin intake reduced IGF-1 
(coefficient for dose-response analysis= -13.14, P = 0.041 and coefficient for 
liner analysis= -0.066, P = 0.038) significantly based on treatment duration.
CONCLUSION: We found in children, intervention duration <12 weeks yielded 
significant reductions in IGF-1, whilst paradoxically, in participants >18 years 
old, metformin intake significantly increased IGF-1. We suggest that caution be 
taken when interpreting the findings of this review, particularly given the 
discordant supplementation practices between children and adults.
