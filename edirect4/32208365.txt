We investigated the protective effects and mechanism of action of metformin on 
high glucose-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. Vascular 
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were subjected to a series of concentrations (0-10 
mM) of metformin. CCK-8, wound healing, and transwell assays were performed. 
Correlations between metformin concentration and high-mobility group box 1 
(HMGB1) and miR-142-3p levels were assessed. In addition, miR-142-3p mimic and 
siRNA were used to investigate VSMC migration in the presence or absence of 
metformin. In the high-glucose condition, metformin decreased cell growth and 
inhibited cell migration. HMGB1 gene expression correlated negatively with 
metformin concentration, whereas miR-142-3p expression correlated positively 
with metformin concentration. In addition, mimic-induced miR-142-3p elevation 
resulted in decreased HMGB1 and LC3II levels and elevated p62 levels in the 
high-glucose condition, whereas miR-142-3p knockdown had the reverse effects, 
and metformin abolished those effects. Metformin inhibits high glucose-induced 
VSMC hyperproliferation and increased migration by inducing miR-142-3p-mediated 
inhibition of HMGB1 expression via the HMGB1-autophagy related pathway.
