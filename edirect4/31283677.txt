BACKGROUND: Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) affects up to 50% of solid 
organ transplant recipients and compromises long-term outcomes. The goal of this 
study was to investigate how immunosuppressants affect gene expression in a 
manner that increases diabetes risk, by performing integrative analysis on 
publicly available, high-throughput gene expression data.
METHODS: All high-throughput gene expression datasets of solid organ transplant 
recipients were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Significantly 
dysregulated genes and pathways were determined, and those in common with type 2 
diabetes were identified. THP-1 and HepG2 cells were exposed in vitro to 
tacrolimus, and validation of genes involved in insulin signaling and glucose 
metabolism was performed using specific arrays. These cells were then treated 
with the hypoglycemic agents, metformin, and insulin to assess for appropriate 
reversion of specific diabetogenic genes.
RESULTS: Insulin signaling and secretion were the most commonly dysregulated 
pathways that overlapped with diabetes in transplant recipients. KRAS, GRB2, 
PCK2, BCL2L1, INSL3, DOK3, and PTPN1 were among the most significantly 
upregulated genes in both immunosuppression and diabetes subsets and were 
appropriately reverted by metformin as confirmed in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered that the significantly dysregulated genes in the 
context of immunosuppression are implicated in insulin signaling and insulin 
secretion, as a manifestation of pancreatic Î²-cell function. In vitro validation 
confirmed key diabetes-related genes in the context of immunosuppression. 
Further analysis and in vitro validation revealed that metformin optimally 
reverts diabetogenic genes dysregulated in the context of immunosuppression. The 
optimal therapeutic management of posttransplant diabetes mellitus needs to be 
further investigated, taking into account the mechanistic impact of 
immunosuppressants.
