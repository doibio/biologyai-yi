Viruses are known to perturb host cellular metabolism to enable their 
replication and spread. However, little is known about the interactions between 
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and host metabolism. Using primary human retinal 
vascular endothelial cells and an established human endothelial cell line, we 
investigated the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator 
of energy metabolism, in response to ZIKV challenge. ZIKV infection caused a 
time-dependent reduction in the active phosphorylated state of AMPK and of its 
downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Pharmacological activation of AMPK 
using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), metformin, and a 
specific AMPKα activator (GSK621) attenuated ZIKV replication. This activity was 
reversed by an AMPK inhibitor (compound C). Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of 
AMPK and the use of AMPKα-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts provided further 
evidence that AMPK has an antiviral effect on ZIKV replication. Consistent with 
its antiviral effect, AMPK activation potentiated the expression of genes with 
antiviral properties (e.g., IFNs, OAS2, ISG15, and MX1) and inhibited 
inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-α and CCL5). Bioenergetic analysis showed that 
ZIKV infection evokes a glycolytic response, as evidenced by elevated 
extracellular acidification rate and increased expression of key glycolytic 
genes (GLUT1, HK2, TPI, and MCT4); activation of AMPK by AICAR treatment reduced 
this response. Consistent with this, 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, 
augmented AMPK activity and attenuated ZIKV replication. Thus, our study 
demonstrates that the anti-ZIKV effect of AMPK signaling in endothelial cells is 
mediated by reduction of viral-induced glycolysis and enhanced innate antiviral 
responses.
