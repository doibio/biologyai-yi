CONTEXT: Lactate is the preferred energy substrate for developing testicular 
germ cells. Diabetes is associated with impaired testicular lactate 
transport/utilisation, and poor sexual behaviour.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of metformin on parameters involved in 
testicular lactate production, transport/utilisation, and sexual behaviour in 
diabetic state.
METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into normal control (NC), 
diabetic control (DC), and metformin-treated diabetic group (n = 6/group). 
Metformin (300 mg/kg b.w./day) was administrated orally for 4 weeks.
RESULTS: Intra-testicular glucose and lactate levels, and lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) activity increased, while the mRNA transcript levels of genes responsible 
for testicular glucose and lactate transport/utilisation (glucose transporter 3, 
monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), MCT2, and LDH type C) decreased in DC 
group. Furthermore, penile nitric oxide increased, while cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate decreased, with impaired sexual behaviour in DC group. Treatment 
with metformin improved these parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin increases testicular lactate transport/utilisation and 
improves sexual behaviour in diabetic state.
