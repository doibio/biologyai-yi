BACKGROUND: Transporter-mediated drug-nutrient interactions have the potential 
to cause serious adverse events. However, unlike drug-drug interactions, these 
drug-nutrient interactions receive little attention during drug development. The 
clinical importance of drug-nutrient interactions was highlighted when a phase 
III clinical trial was terminated due to severe adverse events resulting from 
potent inhibition of thiamine transporter 2 (ThTR-2; SLC19A3).
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested the hypothesis that therapeutic drugs 
inhibit the intestinal thiamine transporter ThTR-2, which may lead to thiamine 
deficiency.
METHODS: For this exploration, we took a multifaceted approach, starting with a 
high-throughput in vitro primary screen to identify inhibitors, building in 
silico models to characterize inhibitors, and leveraging real-world data from 
electronic health records to begin to understand the clinical relevance of these 
inhibitors.
RESULTS: Our high-throughput screen of 1360 compounds, including many clinically 
used drugs, identified 146 potential inhibitors at 200 μM. Inhibition kinetics 
were determined for 28 drugs with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
values ranging from 1.03 μM to >1 mM. Several oral drugs, including metformin, 
were predicted to have intestinal concentrations that may result in 
ThTR-2-mediated drug-nutrient interactions. Complementary analysis using 
electronic health records suggested that thiamine laboratory values are reduced 
in individuals receiving prescription drugs found to significantly inhibit 
ThTR-2, particularly in vulnerable populations (e.g., individuals with 
alcoholism).
CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive analysis of prescription drugs suggests that 
several marketed drugs inhibit ThTR-2, which may contribute to thiamine 
deficiency, especially in at-risk populations.
