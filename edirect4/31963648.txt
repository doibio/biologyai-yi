Despite the benefits of pioglitazone in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD), many treated patients continue to experience disease 
progression. We aimed to investigate the additive effect of ipragliflozin on 
NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and pioglitazone. 
In this 24-week randomized controlled trial, 44 patients with type 2 diabetes 
and comorbid NAFLD were either randomized to receive 50 mg/day of ipragliflozin 
as an add-on treatment (n = 29) or maintained on metformin and pioglitazone (n = 
15). The fatty burden was assessed using the fatty liver index, NAFLD liver fat 
score, and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Changes in fat and muscle 
depots were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and abdominal computed 
tomography scans. The enrolled patients were relatively controlled (mean 
baseline glycated hemoglobin of 6.6% ± 0.6%) and centrally obese (mean waist 
circumference of 101.6 ± 10.9 cm). At week 24, patients in the ipragliflozin 
add-on group exhibited reduced hepatic fat content (fatty liver index: -9.8 ± 
1.9, p = 0.002; NAFLD liver fat score: -0.5 ± 0.2, p = 0.049; CAP: -8.2 ± 7.8 
dB/m2, p = 0.133). Ipragliflozin add-on therapy also reduced whole-body visceral 
fat and the ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat (change in whole-body visceral 
fat: -69.6 ± 21.5 g; change in abdominal visceral fat: -26.2 ± 3.7 cm2; 
abdominal visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio: -0.15 ± 0.04; all p < 0.05). In 
conclusion, ipragliflozin treatment significantly ameliorates liver steatosis 
and reduces excessive fat in euglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD 
taking metformin and pioglitazone.
