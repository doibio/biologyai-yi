ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Erythrina senegalensis is traditionally used in 
Cameroon for its relaxing and hypoglycemic properties in the treatment of 
cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
AIM OF THE STUDY: High blood pressure and diabetes mellitus are frequently 
linked. These pathologies represent major risk factors for cardiovascular and 
renal diseases. The present study was designed to evaluate the antidiabetic and 
antihypertensive activity of the stem bark of Erythrina senegalensis aqueous 
extract in male hypertensive diabetic rats (HDR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hypertension and diabetes were induced by oral 
administration of sucrose (15%) and ethanol (40°) at doses of 1.5 g/kg and 
5 g/kg respectively for 30 days, followed by an intravenous injection of 
streptozotocin (STZ; 40 mg/kg). A control group of 5 rats received distilled 
water (10 mL/kg) followed by intravenous injection of 0.9% NaCl (1 mL/100 g). 
HDR were divided into 4 groups of 5 rats each according to their blood glucose 
level and continued to receive ethanol in association with: distilled water 
(10 mL/kg); group I, metformin (200 mg/kg)+nifedipine (10 mg/kg); group II, 
plant extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) group IV and V, respectively for 28 days. At 
the end of the treatment, hemodynamic parameters were recorded by the direct 
method. Animals were sacrificed; blood and organs (aorta, heart, liver, and 
kidneys) were collected for biochemical and histological analysis. 
Phytochemistry and HPLC-DAD-HRESI-MS were used to determine the major compounds 
of the extract.
RESULTS: The administration of sucrose, alcohol, and STZ resulted in a 
significant increase in blood glucose, hemodynamic parameters, and body weight 
loss. A significant decrease in pancreatic islets size, nitrite, GSH, SOD and 
catalase activity was observed in HDR. There was also a significant increase in 
serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, creatinine, bilirubin, and transaminases 
activity in HDR. The aqueous extract of E. senegalensis, as well as the 
metformin + nifedipine combination, significantly improved all these parameters. 
HPLC coupled to both diode array and mass spectrometry detectors revealed the 
presence of 15 compounds and 11 of them were identified.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the aqueous extract of E. senegalensis 
possess antihypertensive, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, cardiomodulator and 
antioxidant properties involved in the improvement of the metabolic disorders 
found in HDR. This may be due at least in part to the presence of 
Erysenegalensein (D, O, N, E), Warangalone, senegalensin and 
6,8-diprenylgenistein identified in the extract.
