PURPOSE: To assess whether extracorporeal treatment (ECTR) improves outcome of 
patients with metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) and to evaluate the 
clinical applicability of the Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup 
(EXTRIP) criteria for starting ECTR in metformin poisoning.
METHODS: Patients with metformin serum concentrations above 2 mg/l who were 
admitted in the Deventer Teaching Hospital between January 2000 and July 2019 
and complied with the definition of MALA (pH < 7.35 and lactate 
concentration > 5 mmol/l) were included. Mortality and clinical parameters of 
patients treated with ECTR or not were compared. In addition, treatment of MALA 
in clinical practice was verified against the criteria of EXTRIP.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients were included. Lactate (13.8 versus 10.5 mmol/l, 
p = 0.01), creatinine (575 versus 254 umol/l, p < 0.01)), metformin (29.4 versus 
8.6 mg/l, p < 0.01) concentrations, and vasopressor requirement (72% versus 23%, 
p < 0.01) were significantly higher in the ECTR-group. Blood pH (7.05 versus 
7.19, p = 0.03) and bicarbonate (6 versus 11 mmol/l, p < 0.01) were 
significantly lower. Mortality, length of hospital stay, and mechanical 
ventilation requirement were not statistically different. In 83% of patients, 
treatment of MALA was in accordance with the EXTRIP criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no statistical benefit in mortality shown from 
ECTR, ECTR might be lifesaving in MALA, considering the ECTR-group was 
significantly sicker than the non-ECTR-group. The majority of patients were 
treated in line with the EXTRIP criteria. Severity of lactic acidosis and renal 
impairment were the main indications for initiating ECTR.
