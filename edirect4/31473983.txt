PURPOSE: Incretin-based therapies have been introduced in clinical practice for 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment in the last few years. Current 
available medications of this class include glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. In addition to 
GLP-1, DPP-4 is able to inactivate many others peptides as hypothalamic growth 
hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). The aim of this exploratory study was to 
evaluate, on adult diabetic patients, the impact of therapy with incretins, 
particularly DPP-4 inhibitors on GH/IGF-I axis.
METHODS: 60 patients with T2DM were included in the study and they were divided 
into three groups (age and sex comparable) on the basis of their hypoglycemic 
drugs in the last 4 months: group 1 (17 patients, exenatide or 
liraglutide + metformin), group 2 (18 patients, sitagliptin or 
vildagliptin + metformin), group 3 (25 patients, metformin). Anthropometric 
data, glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), IGF-I and acid-labile subunit 
(ALS) were collected in all patients.
RESULTS: Weight, waist circumference and BMI of group 1 were significantly 
higher (P < 0.05) compared to the other groups. Fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c 
of the group 1 were similar compared to those of group 3 (P ns) and higher 
compared to those of group 2 (P < 0.05). IGF-I absolute values, IGF-I SDS were 
not significantly different in the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data evidence that DPP-4 inhibition does not influence 
significantly GH/IGF-I system, confirming what was observed in animal models. 
Further studies are needed to better characterize the properties of these 
molecules on endocrine system.
