PURPOSE: There have been no large-scale studies on whether metformin therapy 
might have a potential benefit for lowering mortality. Thus, this study aimed to 
investigate the association between prior metformin therapy and the development 
of sepsis as well as the association between prior metformin therapy and 30-day 
mortality in sepsis patients.
METHODS: We evaluated adult diabetes patients registered in the 2010 sample 
cohort database of the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea. 
Diabetes was identified according to the International Classification of 
Disease-10 diagnostic system (E10-E14). The cohorts were divided into the 
metformin user group (i.e., those who had been prescribed continuous oral 
metformin over a period of ≥ 90 days) and the control group (i.e., all other 
individuals). The primary endpoint was the development of sepsis between 2011 
and 2015, and the secondary endpoint was 30-day mortality among diabetes 
patients diagnosed with sepsis.
RESULTS: In total, 77,337 patients (34,041 in the metformin user group and 
43,296 in the control group) were included in the analysis, among whom 2512 
patients (3.2%) were diagnosed with sepsis between 2011 and 2015. After 
propensity score adjustment, metformin use was not significantly associated with 
both the risk of sepsis (OR: 0.92, 95%CI 0.82-1.03; P = 0.143) and the risk of 
30-day mortality after diagnosis of sepsis (OR: 0.94, 95%CI 0.75-1.17; 
P = 0.571).
CONCLUSIONS: Prior metformin therapy was not significantly associated with the 
risk of sepsis and 30-day mortality after diagnosis of sepsis among diabetes 
patients.
