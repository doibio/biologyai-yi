Aging biology is intimately associated with dysregulated metabolism, which is 
one of the hallmarks of aging. Aging-related pathways such as mTOR and AMPK, 
which are major targets of anti-aging interventions including rapamcyin, 
metformin, and exercise, either directly regulate or intersect with metabolic 
pathways. In this review, numerous candidate bio-markers of aging that have 
emerged using metabolomics are outlined. Metabolomics studies also reveal that 
not all metabolites are created equally. A set of core "hub" metabolites are 
emerging as central mediators of aging. The hub metabolites reviewed here are 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate, 
α-ketoglutarate, and β-hydroxybutyrate. These "hub" metabolites have signaling 
and epigenetic roles along with their canonical roles as co-factors or 
intermediates of carbon metabolism. Together these hub metabolites suggest a 
central role of the TCA cycle in signaling and metabolic dysregulation 
associated with aging.
