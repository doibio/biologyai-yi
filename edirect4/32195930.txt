BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a female endocrine disease with 
a high incidence. At present, drug treatment is still the main therapeutic 
strategy for PCOS. Traditional Chinese medicine has a long history in the 
treatment of menstrual disorders. Shouwu Jiangqi Decoction (SWJQD) is a 
traditional herbal medicine prescribed in a clinical setting as a remedy for 
PCOS. Acupuncture also plays an important role in regulating the menstrual cycle 
and treating PCOS. This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of the 
combination of SWJQD and acupuncture in the treatment of PCOS.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial will be conducted with a total of 81 
participants diagnosed with PCOS. The participants will be randomly divided into 
3 treatment groups: group A will receive SWJQD combined with acupuncture; group 
B, SWJQD combined with sham acupuncture; and group C, metformin. Each treatment 
will last 3 months. The primary outcomes include the Homeostatic Model 
Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index and the Oral Glucose Tolerance 
Test. The secondary outcome measures include sex hormone levels, body mass 
index, ovulation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and complete genome sequencing 
data. Adverse events will be recorded during the intervention and follow-up.
RESULTS: This study will investigate whether the combination of SWJQD and 
acupuncture can alleviate the clinical symptoms and improve insulin resistance 
in patients with PCOS. The results of this study are expected to provide 
clinical evidence for the application of the combination of SWJQD and 
acupuncture in patients with PCOS.
