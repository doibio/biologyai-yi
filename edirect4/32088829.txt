Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. AD is a 
multifactorial disease with simultaneous occurrence of several connected 
pathological processes including mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired 
proteostasis. Most of these are also implicated in organismal aging per se. The 
presence of separable pathological conditions poses the opportunity to try 
combination treatments that target these different processes separately. This 
approach may provide an effective strategy to target AD; therefore, we 
investigated whether a combination of metformin (targeting mitochondria and 
energy metabolism) and lithium (targeting proteostasis) could result in 
synergistic benefits. In this perspective paper, we looked for benefits in 
lifespan and healthspan using a transgenic nematode strain, GRU102, which 
expresses pan-neuronal human amyloid-beta (Aβ). Individually, metformin and 
lithium extended the lifespan of both non-transgenic GRU101 controls and GRU102. 
Combination treatment using metformin and lithium did not result in any 
synergistic increase in GRU102 lifespan, but this treatment did result in a 
significant compression of morbidity when compared with each individual drug, 
resulting in relative and absolute extension of healthspan. Despite 
over-expressing pathogenic human Aβ in their neurons, GRU102 worms treated with 
the combination treatment enjoyed longer lifespans and significantly compressed 
morbidity, even compared with untreated non-transgenic animals. These findings 
suggest combination treatment as a strategy to compress morbidity, and highlight 
the distinction between healthspan and lifespan.
