In this study, we investigated the lipid metabolism regulatory activity of a 
novel metformin derivative (MD568) and its potential mechanism of action in 
obese rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM). Previous gene chip analysis of 
3T3-L1 cells have shown that MD568 regulates the transcription of genes involved 
in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling pathway, 
fatty acid metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism. In this study, obese T2 DM 
rats were treated with MD568 (200 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Results showed that MD568 
significantly reduced the body weight gain, plasma glucose, insulin, total 
cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. MD568 
treatment also improved the insulin resistance of obese T2 DM model rats. In 
particular, in white adipose tissue, MD568 inhibited the excessive volume 
increment of adipose cells by down-regulating the protein levels of 
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBP-α) and PPAR-γ, as well as the 
transcription of their target lipid metabolism-related genes. In the liver, 
MD568 inhibited hepatic fatty lesions and interfered with hepatic 
gluconeogenesis by regulating the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes 
and glycogen-related kinases. In conclusion, our results suggest that the newly 
synthesized MD568 affects the maintenance of lipid homeostasis in obese type 2 
diabetic rats.
