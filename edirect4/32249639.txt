Fatty acid synthesis is crucial in supporting the survival and proliferation of 
multiple forms of cancer. The high metabolic demands of fatty acid synthesis are 
regulated by the AMP-activated kinase and activity of the fatty acid synthase 
enzyme. In this study, the roles of these enzymes in diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) were investigated by genetic knock-down and pharmacological 
activation of AMP-activated kinase by metformin, and selective inhibition of 
fatty acid synthase using the novel drug Fasnall. We observed distinct 
heterogeneity and adaptive plasticity of lipid metabolism in a panel of DLBCL 
cell lines and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting fatty acid 
synthesis in a subset of DLBCL cells. The translational relevance of these 
inÂ vitro data is supported by the strong correlation between AMP-activated 
protein kinase expression in primary DLBCL samples and disease relapse. 
Inhibition of fatty acid synthase with Fasnall may represent a therapeutic 
option for DLBCL that preferentially subverts to de novo fatty acid synthesis.
