WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal discomfort is the most common 
adverse event of metformin treatment for type 2 diabetes, especially in elderly 
patients. The aim of this study was to compare gastrointestinal adverse events 
resulting from different doses of metformin used for the treatment of elderly 
people with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: A total of 361 elderly patients with newly diagnosed diabetes were 
randomly divided into three groups: metformin 1000 mg/d (N = 120), metformin 
1500 mg/d (N = 121) and metformin 2000 mg/d (N = 120). Glycaemic control and 
gastrointestinal adverse events (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, 
bloating and anorexia) were assessed and compared among the three groups after 
12 weeks of treatment.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: At baseline, there was no significant difference in 
gastrointestinal symptoms among the three groups. After 12 weeks of treatment 
with metformin, the change in HbA1c level was -0.7%, -0.9% and -1.0% for the 
1000 mg/d, 1500 mg/d and 2000 mg/d groups, respectively (P < .0001). There was 
no significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse events among the three 
groups after treatment with metformin. In total, 62 people (17.2%) could not 
tolerate the adverse effects of metformin, and most of them stopped treatment in 
the first 4 weeks. Logistic regression analysis shows that female sex 
(OR = 2.660, 95%CI 1.692-4.183, P < .0001) and the concurrent use of organic 
cation transporter 1-inhibiting drugs (OR = 1.874, 95%CI 1.076-3.265, P = .027) 
are independent risk factors for adverse events.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that metformin doses of 
1000 mg/d-2000 mg/d have similar adverse events but that 2000 mg/d of metformin 
yields the best glycaemic control in elderly people with diabetes. If elderly 
people can tolerate 1000 mg/d of metformin, we could gradually increase the dose 
to 2000 mg/d to achieve better glycaemic control.
