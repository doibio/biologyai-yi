BACKGROUND: An urgent need to reduce the metabolic side-effects of 
glucocorticoid overexposure has been recognised, as glucocorticoid excess can 
lead to Cushing's syndrome, which is associated with high morbidity. We aimed to 
evaluate the potential of metformin to reverse such effects while sparing the 
anti-inflammatory benefits of glucocorticoids.
METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
proof-of-concept, phase 2 trial involving four hospitals in the UK. Patients 
without diabetes were eligible if they were between the ages of 18 and 75 years 
with an inflammatory disease treated with continuous prednisolone (≥20 mg/day 
for ≥4 weeks and remaining on ≥10 mg/day for the subsequent 12 weeks, or its 
cumulative dose-equivalent). Eligible patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to 
either the metformin or placebo groups, using a computer-generated randomisation 
table stratified according to age and BMI. Metformin and placebo were 
administered orally for 12 weeks in escalating doses: 850 mg/day for the first 5 
days, 850 mg twice a day for the next 5 days, and 850 mg three times a day 
subsequently. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in 
visceral-to-subcutaneous fat area ratio over 12 weeks, assessed by CT. Secondary 
outcomes included changes in metabolic, bone, cardiovascular, and inflammatory 
parameters over 12 weeks. Our analysis followed a modified intention-to-treat 
principle for the primary outcome. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01319994.
FINDINGS: Between July 17, 2012, and Jan 14, 2014, 849 patients were assessed 
for study eligibility, of which 53 were randomly assigned to receive either 
metformin (n=26) or placebo (n=27) for 12 weeks. 19 patients in the metformin 
group and 21 in the placebo group were eligible for the primary outcome 
analysis. Both groups received an equivalent cumulative dose of glucocorticoids 
(1860 mg prednisolone-equivalent [IQR 1060-2810] in the metformin group vs 1770 
mg [1020-2356] in the placebo group); p=0·76). No change in the 
visceral-to-subcutaneous fat area ratio between the treatment groups was 
observed (0·11, 95% CI -0·02 to 0·24; p=0·09), but patients in the metformin 
group lost truncal subcutaneous fat compared with the placebo group (-3835 mm2, 
95% CI -6781 to -888; p=0·01). Improvements in markers of carbohydrate, lipid, 
liver, and bone metabolism were observed in the metformin group compared with 
the placebo group. Additionally, those in the metformin group had improved 
fibrinolysis, carotid intima-media thickness, inflammatory parameters, and 
clinical markers of disease activity. The frequency of pneumonia (one event in 
the metformin group vs seven in the placebo group; p=0·01), overall rate of 
moderate-to-severe infections (two vs 11; p=0·001), and all-cause hospital 
admissions due to adverse events (one vs nine; p=0·001) were lower in the 
metformin group than in the placebo group. Patients in the metformin group had 
more events of diarrhoea than the placebo group (18 events vs eight; p=0·01).
INTERPRETATION: No significant changes in the visceral-to-subcutaneous fat area 
ratio between the treatment groups were observed; however, metformin 
administration did improve some of the metabolic profile and clinical outcomes 
for glucocorticoid-treated patients with inflammatory disease, which warrants 
further investigation.
