Mutations in dysferlin are responsible for a group of progressive, recessively 
inherited muscular dystrophies known as dysferlinopathies. Using recombinant 
proteins and affinity purification methods combined with liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we found that AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK)γ1 was bound to a region of dysferlin located between the 
third and fourth C2 domains. Using ex vivo laser injury experiments, we 
demonstrated that the AMPK complex was vital for the sarcolemmal damage repair 
of skeletal muscle fibers. Injury-induced AMPK complex accumulation was 
dependent on the presence of Ca2+, and the rate of accumulation was regulated by 
dysferlin. Furthermore, it was found that the phosphorylation of AMPKα was 
essential for plasma membrane repair, and treatment with an AMPK activator 
rescued the membrane-repair impairment observed in immortalized human myotubes 
with reduced expression of dysferlin and dysferlin-null mouse fibers. Finally, 
it was determined that treatment with the AMPK activator metformin improved the 
muscle phenotype in zebrafish and mouse models of dysferlin deficiency. These 
findings indicate that the AMPK complex is essential for plasma membrane repair 
and is a potential therapeutic target for dysferlinopathy.
