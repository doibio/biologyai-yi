INTRODUCTION: Progestin therapy is the only fertility-sparing treatment option 
for patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) and endometrial cancer 
(EC). However, the results of three meta-analyses revealed a high remission 
rate, as well as an association with a high rate of relapse. We previously 
conducted a phase II of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) plus metformin as a 
fertility-sparing treatment for AEH and EC patients, and reported that metformin 
inhibited disease relapse after remission.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised, open, blinded-endpoint design phase IIb dose 
response trial was planned to commence in July 2019. The trial aims to identify 
the appropriate dose of metformin to be combined with MPA therapy for 
fertility-sparing treatment of patients with AEH and EC. The primary endpoint of 
the trial is the 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate. The secondary 
endpoints are RFS rate, the overall rate of response to MPA therapy, the 
conception rate after treatment, the outcome of pregnancy, toxicity evaluation 
and changes in insulin resistance and body mass index. A total of 120 patients 
will be enrolled from 15 Japanese institutions within a 2.5-year period and 
followed up for at least 3 years.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was approved by the institutional review 
board at Chiba University Hospital and boards at 14 other institutions. The 
trial will be conducted according to the principles of the World Medical 
Association's Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) standards. The trial findings will be published in a 
peer-reviewed journal.
TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT2031190065).
