Progeria syndrome is a rare disorder in childhood which causes accelerated 
systemic aging. Due to the accelerated aging process, disorders which normally 
occur only in old age will appear in these children at a much younger age. We 
report two children with progeria syndrome, in whom fulminant diabetes mellitus 
manifested at a very early age.
