OBJECTIVE: Metformin is the first pharmacological option for treating type 2 
diabetes. However, the use of this drug is not recommended in individuals with 
impaired kidney function because of the perceived risk of lactic acidosis. We 
aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin in patients with type 2 
diabetic kidney disease (DKD).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort 
study of 10,426 patients with type 2 DKD from two tertiary hospitals. The 
primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
progression. The secondary outcome was metformin-associated lactic acidosis. 
Taking into account the possibility that patients with less severe disease were 
prescribed metformin, propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted.
RESULTS: All-cause mortality and incident ESRD were lower in the metformin group 
according to the multivariate Cox analysis. Because the two groups had 
significantly different baseline characteristics, PSM was performed. After 
matching, metformin usage was still associated with lower all-cause mortality 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.65; 95% CI 0.57-0.73; P < 0.001) and ESRD 
progression (aHR 0.67; 95% CI 0.58-0.77; P < 0.001). Only one event of 
metformin-associated lactic acidosis was recorded. In both the original and PSM 
groups, metformin usage did not increase the risk of lactic acidosis events from 
all causes (aHR 0.92; 95% CI 0.668-1.276; P = 0.629).
CONCLUSIONS: In the present retrospective study, metformin usage in advanced 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, especially those with CKD 3B, decreased 
the risk of all-cause mortality and incident ESRD. Additionally, metformin did 
not increase the risk of lactic acidosis. However, considering the remaining 
biases even after PSM, further randomized controlled trials are needed to change 
real-world practice.
