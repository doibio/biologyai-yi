The aims of this study were to characterise the population pharmacokinetics of 
metformin in patients receiving haemodialysis, and to determine the doses that 
will maintain median metformin plasma concentrations below 5 mg L-1 for a 
typical individual. Metformin plasma concentrations from 5 patients receiving 
thrice weekly intermittent haemodialysis followed by metformin 500 mg 
postdialysis were fitted to a published pharmacokinetic model. Additional models 
to describe the dialytic pharmacokinetics of metformin were explored. Doses of 
250 and 500 postdialysis were simulated from the model for a typical 
haemodialysis patient. The published 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model with an 
additional parameter to describe haemodialysis clearance provided a reasonable 
fit to the data. Deterministic simulations from the model for a typical 
individual suggest that metformin doses of 250-500 mg postdialysis and 250 mg 
given once daily should maintain median metformin plasma concentrations below 5 
mg L-1 .
