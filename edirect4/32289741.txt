AIMS: Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder in the 
United States and Europe and is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes 
(T2D). Presence and severity of BED have been associated with worse metabolic 
control and greater BMI in T2D patients. Glucagon Like Peptide-1 (GLP1) 
receptors are present in central nervous system areas involved in appetite 
regulation and treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists modulates appetite and 
reward-related brain areas in humans. We evaluated the effects of treatment with 
dulaglutide on eating behavior in T2D outpatients with BED.
METHODS: This was a pilot open label, prospective controlled study. Inclusion 
criteria were: Age ≤65, HbA1c between 7.5 and 9% on metformin therapy alone, 
normal renal function and diagnosis of BED. Patients were randomly assigned to 
receive either Dulaglutide 1,5 mg/sett or Gliclazide 60 mg for 12 weeks. We 
evaluated baseline binge eating scale score (BES), weight, BMI, percentage fat 
mass, HbA1c and their changes after treatment. A multivariate linear regression 
model was used to verify the association between Δ BES from baseline with Δ 
Hba1c and variation of anthropometric parameters after treatment.
RESULTS: After 12 weeks patients treated with dulaglutide had grater reduction 
of binge eating behaviour (p < 0.0001), body weight (p < 0,0001), BMI 
(p < 0.0001), percentage fat mass (p < 0.0001) and HbA1c (p = 0.009) than 
patients treated with gliclazide. Reduction in BES was associated with reduction 
in body weight (p < 0.0001) and HbA1c (p = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: Dulaglutide treatment reduces binge eating behaviour in T2D patients 
with BED.
