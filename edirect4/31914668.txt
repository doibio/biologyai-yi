The hypoglycemic effect of Phellinus linteus polysaccharide extract (PLPE) has 
been documented in several previous studies, but the functional interactions 
among PLPE, gut microbiota, and the hypoglycemic effect remain unclear. We 
examined the regulatory effect of PLPE on gut microbiota, and the molecular 
mechanism underlying improvement of insulin resistance, using a type 2 diabetic 
rat model. Here, 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four 
groups that were subjected to intervention of saline (normal and model control 
group), metformin (120 mg/kg.bw), and PLPE (600 mg/kg.bw) by oral 
administration. After 8 weeks of treatment, PLPE increased levels of short-chain 
fatty acids (SCFAs) by enhancing abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria. SCFAs 
maintained intestinal barrier function and reduced lipopolysaccharides content 
in blood, thereby helping to reduce systemic inflammation and reverse insulin 
resistance. Our findings suggest that PLPE (in which polysaccharides are the 
major component) has potential application as a prebiotic for regulating gut 
microbiota composition in diabetic patients.
