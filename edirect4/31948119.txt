There is increasing proof that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated 
with the increased frequency of thyroid disturbances. Chamomile (Matricaria 
chamomilla L.) herb and metformin showed therapeutic efficacy against polycystic 
ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study aimed to investigate the possible therapeutic 
effect of both chamomile flower extract and metformin against thyroid damage 
associated with PCOS in rats. The PCOS model was developed in rats by injecting 
estradiol valerate, and it was confirmed to be associated with thyroid 
hypofunction biochemically and pathologically. Treatment of PCOS rats with both 
chamomile extract and metformin resulted in an improvement in serum level of 
thyroid hormones (TSH, p < 0.01; T3 and T4, p < 0.05) and the disappearance of 
most thyroid gland pathological changes demonstrated by light and electron 
microscopes. They also reduced the level of serum estrogen (p < 0.01). Both 
chamomile extract and metformin decreased MDA (p < 0.05) and increased GPx and 
CAT (p < 0.01). Only chamomile extract increased GSH (p < 0.01). Both treatments 
reduced the apoptotic death of thyroid cells as noted by the reduction of 
caspase-3 immunoexpression (p < 0.01). In conclusion, both Matricariachamomilla 
extract and metformin ameliorated hypothyroidism associated with PCOS through an 
antioxidant and antiapoptotic mechanism.
