AIMS: Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anthracycline anticancer drug. However, 
the clinical usage of it is limited due to its severe cardiotoxicity side 
effects. Metformin (Met) is a kind of first-line antihyperglycemic drug which 
has a potential protective effect on the heart，it is often used for oral 
treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we explored whether Met could 
attenuate cardiotoxicity induced by DOX.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the sake of exploring the Met protective effect and 
mechanism, we established the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity models both in H9C2 
cells incubated with 5 μM DOX in vitro and Sprague-Dawley rats treated with 
20 mg/kg cumulative dose of DOX.
KEY FINDINGS: Met is able to inhibit growth inhibition and apoptosis of H9C2 
cells induced by DOX. The heart indexes of rats were examined to evaluate the 
Met cardiotoxicity protection. Met improved the abnormal indexes, serum markers 
of cardiac heart injury, echocardiography, electrocardiogram, cardiac pathology, 
cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and oxidative stress markers induced by DOX. 
Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that Met protected 
against DOX-induced increasing cleaved caspase-3 and Bax. Met also prevented the 
downregulation of Bcl-2, activated the AMPK pathway, and inhibited the MAPK 
pathway.
SIGNIFICANCE: Met showed protective effects on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by 
reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis, as well as regulating AMPK and MAPK 
signaling pathways.
