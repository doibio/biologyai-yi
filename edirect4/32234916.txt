AIM: To investigate potential association between administration of 
corticosteroids, antibiotics, probiotics, proton pump inhibitors, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), statins and metformin and outcome in patients 
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with nivolumab.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 224 patients with advanced NSCLC treated at 
nine comprehensive cancer centers were analyzed in this national retrospective 
study. Survival statistics were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox 
analysis.
RESULTS: Only corticosteroid use had a significant negative effect on the 
objective response rate. In the univariate analysis, there was no significant 
effect of the studied concomitant medications on the efficacy of nivolumab. In a 
subsequent multifactorial analysis, a possible positive effect of the 
concomitant use of NSAID at the initiation of nivolumab treatment was revealed.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present retrospective exploratory analysis 
underscore the importance of knowing the exact type of concomitant medication, 
the route of administration, the dose of medication, and the region of the 
ongoing study. The present data indicated a significantly higher rate of 
progression in patients treated with corticosteroids and the possible positive 
effect of NSAID use at the initiation of nivolumab treatment.
