OBJECTIVE: CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-14) is a chemokine released by 
active brown fat, showing protective effects against insulin resistance in 
experimental models. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescent girls is 
usually related to hepato-visceral fat excess and insulin resistance, and 
associates with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes. Treatment with a low-dose 
combination of one antiandrogen and antimineralocorticoid drug (spironolactone) 
and two insulin sensitizers (pioglitazone/metformin) (SPIOMET) is particularly 
effective in improving these metabolic derangements. Adipose tissue may be 
involved in the metabolic alterations of PCOS, and it is a likely target of 
therapeutic action. We investigated the alterations in CXCL14 levels and the 
effects of drugs composing SPIOMET treatment on CXCL14 in human adipocytes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 51 adolescent patients with PCOS and 21 
age-matched healthy controls. Thirty-one adolescent patients with PCOS under 
SPIOMET or oral contraception-based treatment were also studied. For studies in 
vitro, Simpson Golabi Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) adipose cells were used. Gene 
expression for CXCL14 and other genes was quantified using quantitative 
real-time PCR. The levels of CXCL14 and adipokines in serum and cell culture 
media were determined by ELISA.
RESULTS: Serum CXCL14 levels are reduced in patients with PCOS. One-year SPIOMET 
treatment normalized CXCL14 concentrations and improved the metabolic status of 
patients with PCOS. Pioglitazone induced CXCL14 expression in differentiating 
human SGBS adipocytes, in parallel with the induction of marker genes of brown 
adipogenesis. Spironolactone induced CXCL14 expression and release in 
differentiated human adipocytes.
CONCLUSION: Insulin sensitization with SPIOMET normalizes the abnormally low 
levels of CXCL14 in girls with PCOS. This is consistent with the effects of 
pioglitazone and spironolactone inducing CXCL14 expression and promoting a 
brown-like phenotype in adipocytes. CXCL14 may be a novel biomarker for PCOS as 
well as a potential mediator of the beneficial effects of the SPIOMET 
combination and may hold promise as a therapeutic modulator of the disorder.
