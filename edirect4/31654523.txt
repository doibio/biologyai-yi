INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes is on the rise and demographics are changing 
in many countries due to increased migration. Simultaneously, the treatment of 
gestational diabetes in our clinic has shifted towards metformin with 
substantially less insulin treatment. The aim was to study the impact of these 
changes on metabolic control and pregnancy outcome by comparing women diagnosed 
with gestational diabetes during 2012-2013 and 2016-2017.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our universal Oral Glucose Tolerance Test screening 
program for gestational diabetes diagnosed 199 women with singleton pregnancies 
during 2012-2013 and 203 during 2016-2017. Treatment and achieved metabolic 
control in the two different time periods were compared. Pregnancy outcome data 
related to gestational diabetes were retrieved from case notes and compared 
between the different time periods.
RESULTS: When comparing results from 2016-2017 with 2012-2013 there was no 
difference in maternal weight or weight gain. There was a higher frequency of 
heredity (52.6 vs 35.4%; P = 0.001) and non-Scandinavian ethnicity (46.5 vs 
33.8%; P = 0.011).The frequency of smoking during pregnancy was significantly 
lower (2.6 vs 7.7%; P = 0.023) There was an improved metabolic control as 
measured by median glucose in 2016-2017 compared with 2012-2013 (5.8 vs 
6.2 mmol/L; P < 0.001). Insulin was less frequently used in 2016-2017 than in 
2012-2013 (32.5 vs 44.7%; P = 0.012). There was a significant increase in the 
use of metformin (14.8 vs 0%; P < 0.001). There were no differences regarding 
the frequency of large-for-gestational-age infants (8.2% vs 7.3%; P = 0.762) or 
macrosomia (16.3 vs 15.1%; P = 0.745), median birthweight (3510 vs 3521; 
P = 0.879), frequency of cesarean section (28.1 vs 27.8%; P = 0.951) or Apgar 
scores at 10 minutes (10 [3-10] vs 10 [7-10]; P = 0.290).
CONCLUSIONS: In an increasing but changing population of gestational diabetes 
women in our region, with more hereditary and non-Scandinavian origins, but with 
fewer smokers, metabolic control has improved with maintained favorable 
pregnancy outcomes, with more frequent use of metformin and substantially less 
use of insulin treatment.
