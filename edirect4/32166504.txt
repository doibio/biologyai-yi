PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are the 
most recently approved class of drugs (since 2012) for type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM), but their economic merits have yet been fully confirmed. The objective 
of this review was to evaluate the most updated evidence that examined the 
cost-effectiveness of SGLT2i for T2DM.
RECENT FINDINGS: We systematically searched Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and Web of 
Science for eligible articles from January 1, 2011, to October 31, 2019, using 
combinations of search words. A supplementary search using reference lists of 
eligible articles and other review articles was also performed. A multistage 
screening process was carried out with duplicates removal, abstract screening, 
and full-text reading to confirm eligibility. Two reviewers independently 
screened the eligible articles and assessed reporting quality using the 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. 
A total of 24 studies were included in the final review. All studies showed good 
quality according to the CHEERS checklist (scored 21-24). Seven studies compared 
SGLT2i vs. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), 3 studies compared SGLT2i 
vs. sulfonylureas (SU), 3 compared SGLT2i vs. glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
agonist (GLP-1 RA), 2 compared SGLT2i vs. SGLT2i, 3 compared SGLT2i vs. other 
antidiabetic therapies including thiazolidinediones (TZD), alpha-glucosidase 
inhibitors (AGI) or insulin, and 5 compared SGLT2i vs. standard care/metformin. 
Most studies concluded SGLT2i was cost-effective relative to its comparator 
except GLP-1 RA, where two studies suggested GLP-1 RA was the favorable 
treatment option relative to SGLT2i. The literature demonstrated that SGLT2i may 
be cost-effective compared to many antidiabetic therapies including DPP-4i, SU, 
TZD, AGI, insulin, and standard care .
