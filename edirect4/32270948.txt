BACKGROUND: Donor organs for liver transplantation may often have fatty liver 
disease, which confers a higher sensitivity to ischemia/reperfusion injury. At 
present, there is no effective treatment for the condition. Evidence has 
suggested that metformin, the first-line medication for diabetes, has protective 
effects against many disorders. However, the potential role of metformin in 
ischemia/reperfusion injury in fatty liver disease remains unclear.
AIMS: To examine the effect of metformin treatment during ischemia/reperfusion 
injury in fatty liver and determine the possible mechanisms.
STUDY DESIGN: Animal experimentation.
METHODS: Sprague-Dawley male rats were fed a high-fat diet (520 kcal/100 g) for 
14 weeks and then were subjected to the orthotopic autologous liver 
transplantation model. Sections of liver tissue were stained with hematoxylin 
and eosin to visualize the damage. Blood and liver samples were used to analyze 
the related proteins and components involved in the inflammatory signaling 
pathway.
RESULTS: We found that metformin significantly ameliorated the 
ischemia/reperfusion injury of the fatty liver through a reduction in alanine 
aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase concentrations in the serum and a 
decrease in dead cells, as shown by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay (p<0.05). In addition, 
metformin significantly attenuated interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis 
factor-α production and increased the expression of active caspase-3 and Bax in 
the liver (p<0.05). Mechanistically, metformin suppressed the activation of 
toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-κB signaling (p<0.05), resulting in a decreased 
inflammatory response and apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that metformin attenuated 
ischemia/reperfusion injury in fatty liver disease via the TLR4/NF-κB axis, 
suggesting that metformin could have potential therapeutic applications in 
ischemia/reperfusion injury associated with liver transplantation.
