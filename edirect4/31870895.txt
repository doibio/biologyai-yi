BACKGROUND: Indocyanine green (ICG) doped with nano-curcumin (N-CUR) can 
increase photosensitivity in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). Since 
metformin (Met) provides a synergistic advantage with photosensitivity, it was 
conjugated with N-CUR@ICG. Aim of the study was to evaluate the photosensitizing 
effect of N-CUR@ICG-Met used as a new photosensitizer in dual wavelengths 
irradiation (diode laser and light-emitting diode, LED) aPDT in root canals 
infected with Enterococcus faecalis biofilm.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following synthesis and confirmation of N-CUR@ICG-Met by 
Scanning electrone microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) 
spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Zetasizer analysis, the mature 
microbial biofilm was formed. The quantitative and qualitative evaluations of E. 
faecalis biofilm were made using microbial viability and SEM analysis of the 
following groups of treatment modalities (n = 5): 1- N-CUR, 2- ICG, 3- Met, 4- 
N-CUR@ICG, 5- N-CUR@ICG-Met, 6- Diode laser, 7- LED, 8- aPDT/diode, 9- aPDT/LED, 
10- aPDT/diode laser + LED, 11- aPDT/LED + diode laser, 12- 2.5 % sodium 
hypochlorite (NaOCl). In addition, E. faecalis not treated served as negative 
control. Data were statistically analyzed using One-way Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA) and the post-Hoc Bonferroni tests with a level of significance set at 
P < 0.05.
RESULTS: SEM, FT-IR, XRD, Zetasizer analysis confirmed successful doping of 
ICG-Met onto/into N-CUR. The treatment modality of N-CUR@ICG-Met mediated 
aPDT/diode laser, aPDT/LED, aPDT/diode laser + LED, and aPDT/LED + diode laser 
statistically decreased the cell viability of E. faecalis for 69.40 %, 75.52 %, 
82.74 %, and 83.84 %, respectively compared with the negative control group 
(P < 0.05). The double wavelengths irradiation technique, which exposed the 
N-CUR@ICG-Met with diode laser irradiation and immediately after with LED (i.e. 
group No. 10), as well as, N-CUR@ICG-Met with LED irradiation and immediately 
after with diode laser (i.e. group No. 11) reduced the viable E. faecalis count 
in biofilm structures statistically more than the other treatment modalities 
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: N-CUR@ICG-Met as a new photosensitizer in dual wavelengths 
irradiation method may improve anti-biofilm activity of aPDT against E. 
faecalis.
