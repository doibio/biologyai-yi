Ovarian cancer selective metastasizes to the omentum contributing to the poor 
prognosis associated with ovarian cancer. However, the mechanism underlining 
this propensity and therapeutic approaches to counter this process has not been 
fully elucidated. Here, we show that MCP-1 produced by omental adipocytes 
binding to its cognate receptor CCR-2 on ovarian cancer cells facilitates 
migration and omental metastasis by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and its 
downstream effectors HIF-1Î± and VEGF-A in cell lines, xenografts, and transgenic 
murine models. MCP-1 antibody significantly decreased tumor burden and increased 
survival of mice in vivo. Interestingly, metformin decreased omental metastasis 
at least partially by inhibiting MCP-1 secretion from adipocytes independent of 
direct effects on cancer cells. Together this suggests a novel target of 
MCP-1/CCR-2 axis that could benefit ovarian cancer patients.
