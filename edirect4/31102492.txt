AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Metformin, a widely prescribed antidiabetic agent, has been 
shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in obese and type 2 diabetes 
patients, but the mechanism is not well elucidated. Microribonucleic acids 
(miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding ribonucleic acids that participate in 
many biological and pathological processes. The aim of the present study was to 
investigate whether Dicer, a key miRNA biogenesis enzyme, and miRNAs in 
macrophages are implicated in the anti-inflammatory effects of metformin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse 
transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction were carried out to verify 
the anti-inflammatory effects of metformin. miRNA microarray was applied to 
detect the expression profile of miRNA. Western-blotting, enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction were used to examine the role Dicer and miRNAs play in the 
anti-inflammatory effects of metformin.
RESULTS: In parallel with the suppression of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis 
factor-α production in resting and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, 
metformin could induce an increase in Dicer and most miRNAs. When Dicer was 
knocked down, the anti-inflammatory effects of metformin were significantly 
attenuated. Additionally, the upregulation of miRNA (miR)-34a-5p and miR-125b-5p 
by metformin were also blunted in Dicer knockdown macrophages. Furthermore, 
inhibition of miR-34a-5p and miR-125b-5p could impair the suppressive action of 
metformin on pro-inflammatory factors production, whereas overexpression of the 
two miRNAs mimicked the anti-inflammatory effects of metformin.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin might show anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages 
through the induction of Dicer and the subsequent upregulation of miR-34a-5p and 
miR-125b-5p.
