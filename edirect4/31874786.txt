BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diabetes is a significant risk factor for the 
development of cardiovascular disease, which is the main cause of death. The 
purpose of this study was to determine the level of glycaemic control in 
patients with type 2 diabetes without cardiovascular disease in Spain. The data 
used includes the most recent determination of glycosylated haemoglobin, as well 
as the pattern of antidiabetic treatment, the incidence of episodes of severe 
hypoglycaemia in the last 6 months, and the level of control of cardiovascular 
risk factors, and gender.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A national, multicentre, and cross-sectional 
epidemiological study in which 800 doctors associated with the GDPS network 
participated.
RESULTS: Of the total of 1,059 patients, 57% male, with a mean age of 62.7 years 
in men vs. 65.2 in women (P<.001). The mean onset of diabetes was 9.4±7.5 years. 
The mean HbA1C was 7.0% in men vs. 7.1% in women (P=.039), with the control 
objective of <7% being observed in 47.2%. There were 65% patients on treatment 
with metformin, and 62.4% on DPP-4 inhibitors, and basal insulin: 14.2%. 
Incidence of severe hypoglycemias in the last 6 months was 1.9%. The women had 
worse glycaemic control, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, abdominal obesity, 
and glomerular filtration levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The glycaemic control is worse in women even if adjusted for age 
and time of onset of diabetes (P=.043), and for the number of hypoglycaemic 
agents (P=.015). The level of control is also worse in women for dyslipidaemia, 
abdominal obesity, and glomerular filtration. A preventive strategy promoted 
from Primary care on healthy lifestyles and controlling all vascular risk 
factors is essential.
