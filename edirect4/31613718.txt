A procedure was established and fully validated for the screening and 
quantification of fourteen synthetic antidiabetic adulterants in herbal 
pharmaceuticals and health foods, including metformin (MF), buformin (BF), 
phenformin (PHF), rosiglitazone (RGZ), pioglitazone (PGZ), chlorpropamide (CPM), 
glipizide (GPZ), tolbutamide (TBM), gliclazide (GCZ), glibenclamide (GBM), 
glimepiride (GMR), repaglinide (RGN), gliquidone (GQD) and nateglinide (NGN). 
The samples were extracted by methanol and separated by HPLC. Retention times 
and ultraviolet spectra were used for the preliminary screening, and the 
suspected adulterants were then confirmed by liquid 
chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) and 
quantified by HPLC. The developed procedure was successfully applied to assess 
twenty-four herbal samples, and PHF, GCZ, GBM, MF, GPZ and BF were found in 
many. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of simultaneous 
screening and quantification of these fourteen synthetic antidiabetic 
adulterants from any matrix.
