OBJECTIVE: Dual incretin receptor agonists in clinical development have shown 
reductions in body weight and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 
diabetes, but the impact of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) 
receptor activation remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the effects of high-dose 
exogenous GIP on energy intake, energy expenditure, plasma glucose, and 
glucose-regulating hormones in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with a 
long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind design, men with type 
2 diabetes (n = 22, mean ± SEM HbA1c 6.8 ± 0.1% [51 ± 1.5 mmol/mol]) treated 
with metformin and long-acting GLP-1R agonists were subjected to two 5-h 
continuous infusions (separated by a washout period of ≥3 days): one with GIP (6 
pmol/kg/min) and another with saline (placebo). After 60 min of infusion, a 
liquid mixed-meal test was performed, and after 270 min of infusion, an ad 
libitum meal was served for evaluation of energy intake (primary end point).
RESULTS: Energy intake was similar during GIP and placebo infusion (648 ± 74 
kcal vs. 594 ± 55 kcal, respectively; P = 0.480), as were appetite measures and 
energy expenditure. Plasma glucagon and glucose were higher during GIP infusion 
compared with placebo infusion (P = 0.026 and P = 0.017) as assessed by area 
under the curve.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, GIP infusion on top of treatment 
with metformin and a long-acting GLP-1R agonist did not affect energy intake, 
appetite, or energy expenditure but increased plasma glucose compared with 
placebo. These results indicate no acute beneficial effects of combining GIP and 
GLP-1.
