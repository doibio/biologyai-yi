BACKGROUND: Temporal changes in the dispensing of glucose-lowering drugs (GLD) 
and their associated costs among elderly populations is unclear. This 
information is especially relevant to countries in which medications are partly 
or fully government subsidized.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the trends in prevalence, incidence and 
costs associated with GLD dispensed to older Australians.
METHODS: We analysed Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data for 76,906 people 
aged ≥ 65 years dispensed diabetes medications over the period 2013-2016.
RESULTS: Older males were dispensed more GLD than were older females, with the 
marginal difference increasing from 3.2% in 2013 (age-sex adjusted incidence 
rate ratio [aIRR] 1.032; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.024-1.041; p < 0.001) to 
3.9% in 2016 (aIRR 1.039; 95% CI 1.030-1.047; p < 0.001). The number of GLD 
dispensed per person was consistently lower in those aged ≥ 75 years than in 
those aged 65-74 years, with the gap widening over the years. More patients were 
initiated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like 
peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors over the study 
period, at the expense of older GLD. The proportion of users and attributed 
costs associated with the use of metformin, sulfonylureas, α-glucosidase 
inhibitors and thiazolidinediones decreased over time. The total subsidized 
costs of GLD is forecast to increase to $A395 million by 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment landscape for diabetes in Australia is undergoing 
dynamic change. More patients were initiated with the newer but costlier GLD 
over the study period.
