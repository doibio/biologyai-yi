AIMS: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of generic exenatide 
with branded exenatide Byetta® in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) inadequately controlled on monotherapy or combination therapy of 
metformin and insulin secretagogues.
METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial was 
performed. A total of 240 patients with T2DM and glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) ≥ 7% (53 mmol/mol) to ≤ 9.0% (75 mmol/mol) on monotherapy or combination 
therapy of metformin and insulin secretagogues for at least 3 months were 
randomized into generic exenatide or branded exenatide groups with a 1:1 ratio 
for 16 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c levels 
from baseline at week 16, with a non-inferiority margin of 
- 0.35% (- 3.83 mmol/mol) (lower bound of one-sided 95% confidence interval 
(CI) > - 0.35% (- 3.83 mmol/mol)). Secondary endpoints included the proportion 
of participants achieving HbA1c < 7% (53 mmol/mol), the changes in fasting 
plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h postprandial glucose (2hPG) following a standard meal, 
7-point self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) profiles, body weight change from 
baseline at week 16 and the change in HbA1c levels from baseline at week 8. 
Safety issues were also evaluated.
RESULTS: After 16 weeks of treatment, HbA1c levels decreased significantly from 
baseline in the two groups, with a reduction of - 1.10% ± 1.31% 
(- 12.0 mmol/mol ± 14.3 mmol/mol) in the generic exenatide group and 
- 1.08% ± 1.11% (- 11.8 mmol/mol ± 12.1 mmol/mol) in the branded exenatide group 
(both P < 0.001). The least-squares mean difference of HbA1c reduction between 
the two groups was - 0.03% (- 0.33 mmol/mol), with a lower one-sided 95% CI 
limit of - 0.27% (- 2.95 mmol/mol), which was higher than the prespecified 
non-inferiority margin of - 0.35% (- 3.83 mmol/mol). Moreover, there were no 
significant differences in the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c < 7% 
(53 mmol/mol) and the changes in FPG, 2hPG, 7-point SMBG profiles and body 
weight at week 16 and the change in HbA1c levels from baseline at week 8 (all 
P > 0.05) between the two groups. The incidence of adverse events, including the 
incidence of hypoglycemia (18.3% and 17.5%, respectively), was similar for the 
generic and branded exenatide groups (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on monotherapy or 
combination therapy of metformin and insulin secretagogues, add-on treatment 
with generic exenatide demonstrated non-inferiority to branded exenatide in 
terms of improvements in HbA1c after 16 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, the two 
drugs were also similar for other efficacy endpoints and safety profile. Trial
