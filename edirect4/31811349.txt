The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the pharmacological effects of 
Geniposide (GEN) on high diet fed and streptozotocin (STZ)-caused diabetic 
cognitive impairment. The mice were fed with high fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks and 
intraperitoneally injected with 60 mg/kg STZ for three times within 72 h. The 
mice with glucose level over 15 mmol/l were regarded as diabetic and selected 
for further studies. The animals were intragastrically treated with metformin or 
GEN once daily for 4 weeks. Afterwards, the animals were applied for Y maze, 
novel object recognition (NOR) test, step-through passive avoidance test, and 
Morris water maze (MWM) test. The blood glucose and body weight were examined. 
The SH-SY5Y cells were treated with GEN in the presence or absence of ibrutinib 
and stimulated with high-glucose culture medium. The tumor necrosis factor-a 
(TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 in serum, hippocampus, and supernatant were 
measured using ELISA method. The protein expressions of Bruton's tyrosine kinase 
(BTK), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88), 
nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), p-NF-κB, brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF), cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), p-CREB, and glucagon-like 
peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) were detected by western blot analyses. As a result, 
the GEN treatment notably attenuated the body weight, blood glucose, and 
cognitive decline. GEN also inhibited the generations of inflammatory cytokines. 
Furthermore, the administrations of GEN ameliorated the alterations of BTK, 
TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, and BDNF in HFD + STZ-induced mice. With the application of 
ibrutinib, the selective inhibitor of BTK, it was also found that BTK/TLR4/NF-κB 
pathway was associated with the GEN treatment in high glucose-induced SH-SY5Y 
cells. In summary, the results suggested that GEN exerted the protective effect 
on STZ-induced cognitive impairment possibly through the modulation of 
BTK/TLR4/NF-κB signaling.
