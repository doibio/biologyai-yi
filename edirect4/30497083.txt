BACKGROUND: Enhanced platelet reactivity represents one of the major 
determinants of cardiovascular risk among diabetic patients. The aim of the 
present study was to evaluate the impact of metformin use on platelet reactivity 
in diabetic patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).
METHODS: We included diabetic patients treated with DAPT after an acute coronary 
syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention. Platelet reactivity was assessed 
at 30-90 days by Multiple-electrode aggregometry. In an additional cohort of 
diabetic patients naïve to antiplatelet therapy, we assessed platelet reactivity 
by light transmission aggregometry, surface expression of P-selectin and plasma 
concentration of Thromboxane B2 (TxB2).
RESULTS: We included 219 diabetic patients, 117 (53.4%) treated with metformin. 
Metformin was associated with younger age (p=0.03), male gender (p=0.02), lower 
rate of hypertension (p=0.04), active smoker (p=0.002), previous MI (p<0.001) 
renal failure (p<0.001), fibrinogen (p<0.001) and C-reactive protein (p=0.04), 
larger use of diuretics (p=0.04) calcium antagonists (p=0.05), better glycemic 
control (p<0.001) and higher haemoglobin (p=0.003). The prevalence of HAPR did 
not significantly differ according to hypoglycemic treatment (p=0.73; adjusted 
OR[95%CI]=5.63[0.42-76], p=0.19). Moreover, no impact of metformin was observed 
for HRPR (p=0.77; adjusted OR[95%CI]=1.15[0.55-2.4], p=0.71). Among an 
additional cohort of 42 diabetic patients naïve to antiplatelet therapy, we 
confirmed no impact of metformin or insulin on aggregation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found no apparent association in diabetic patients 
treated with DAPT, between the use of metformin and platelet reactivity or the 
rate of HPR.
