Rotenone is a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, which can cause the death of 
dopaminergic (DA) neurons and Parkinson's disease (PD). Currently, whether 
metformin has a protective effect on neurotoxicity induced by rotenone is 
unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential protective 
effect of metformin against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity. PD animal model was 
established by unilateral rotenone injection into the right substantia nigra 
(SN) of C57BL/6 mice. The behavioral tests were performed by rotarod test and 
cylinder test. The numbers of TH-positive neurons and Iba-1 positive microglia 
in the SN were investigated by immunohistochemical staining. The mRNA levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) and molecules involved in 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (ATF4, ATF6, XBP1, Grp78, and CHOP) in the 
midbrain were detected by Quantitative real-time PCR. This study showed that 
50 mg/kg metformin given orally daily, beginning 3 d before rotenone injection 
and continuing for 4 weeks following rotenone injection, significantly 
ameliorated dyskinesia, increased the number of TH-positive neurons, and 
mitigated the activation of microglia in the SN in rotenone-induced PD mice. 
Furthermore, 50 mg/kg metformin markedly downregulated the expression of 
proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) and ER stress-related genes (ATF4, 
ATF6, XBP1, Grp78, and CHOP) in rotenone-induced PD mice. Metformin has a 
protective effect on DA neurons against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity through 
inhibiting neuroinflammation and ER stress in PD mouse model.
