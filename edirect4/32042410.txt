Ficus deltoidea var. deltoidea Jack (FD) is a well-known plant used in Malay 
folklore medicine to lower blood glucose in diabetic patients. For further 
research of the antihyperglycemic mechanisms, the protein tyrosine phosphatase 
1B (PTP1B)-inhibitory effect of FD was analysed both in vitro and in vivo. To 
optimise a method for FD extraction, water, 50, 70, 80, 90 and 95 % ethanol 
extracts were prepared and determined for their total phenolic and triterpene 
contents, and PTP1B-inhibition capacity. Among the tested extracts, 70 % ethanol 
FD extract showed a significant PTP1B inhibition (92·0 % inhibition at 200 
µg/ml) and high phenolic and triterpene contents. A bioassay-guided 
fractionation of the 70 % ethanol extract led to the isolation of a new 
triterpene (3β,11β-dihydroxyolean-12-en-23-oic acid; F3) along with six known 
compounds. In vivo, 4 weeks' administration of 70 % ethanol FD extract (125, 250 
and 500 mg/kg/d) to streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced type 2 diabetic rats 
reversed the abnormal changes of blood glucose, insulin, total Hb, GLUT2, lipid 
profile, and oxidative stress in liver and pancreas. Moreover, FD reduced the 
mRNA expression of the key gluconeogenic enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase) and restored insulin receptor and GLUT2 
encoding gene (Slc2a2) expression. In addition, FD significantly down-regulated 
the hepatic PTP1B gene expression. These results revealed that FD could 
potentially improve insulin sensitivity, suppress hepatic glucose output and 
enhance glucose uptake in type 2 diabetes mellitus through down-regulation of 
PTP1B. Together, our findings give scientific evidence for the traditional use 
of FD as an antidiabetic agent.
