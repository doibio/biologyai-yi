Mitochondria have an essential function in cell survival due to their role in 
bioenergetics, reactive oxygen species generation, calcium buffering, and other 
metabolic activities. Mitochondrial dysfunctions are commonly found in 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), and diabetes is a risk factor for NDs. 
However, the role of mitochondria in diabetic neurodegeneration is still 
unclear. In the present study, we review the latest evidence on the role of 
mitochondrial dysfunctions in the development of diabetes-related NDs and the 
underlying molecular mechanisms. Hypoglycemic agents, especially metformin, have 
been proven to have neuroprotective effects in the treatment of diabetes, in 
which mitochondria could act as one of the underlying mechanisms. Other 
hypoglycemic agents, including thiazolidinediones (TZDs), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 
(DPP-4) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, have 
gained more attention because of their beneficial effects on NDs, presumably by 
improving mitochondrial function. Our review highlights the notion that 
mitochondria could be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of NDs in 
patients with diabetes.
