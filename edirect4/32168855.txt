Food-derived bioactive compounds such as resveratrol are increasingly explored 
for their protective effects against metabolic complications. Evidence supports 
the strong antioxidant properties and therapeutic effects of resveratrol in 
managing diabetes and its associated complications. However, evidence informing 
on the comparative or combination effects of this natural compound with an 
accomplished and well-characterized antidiabetic agent like metformin has not 
been revised. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive systematic search of the major 
electronic databases which included MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. The 
cumulative evidence strongly supports the comparative effects of metformin and 
resveratrol in ameliorating diabetes-associated complications in preclinical 
settings. In particular, both compounds showed strong ameliorative effects 
against hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, a pro-inflammatory 
response, and lipid peroxidation in various experimental models of diabetes. 
Enhancing intracellular antioxidant capacity in addition to activating 
NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and AMP-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK) are the prime mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of these 
compounds. Of interest, preclinical evidence also demonstrates that the 
combination treatment with these compounds may have a greater efficacy in 
protecting against diabetes. Thus, confirmation of such evidence in 
well-organized clinical trials remains crucial to uncover novel therapeutic 
strategies to manage diabetes and its linked complications.
