BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction. 
The relationship between metformin therapy and cognitive function in patients 
with T2D is unknown. Therefore, we determined the relationship between metformin 
therapy and cognitive function in patients with T2D using a meta-analysis.
METHODS: We systematically searched the Cochrane library, PubMed, and Embase to 
identify studies showing correlations, and we calculated hazard ratios (HRs).
RESULTS: We identified 10 studies including 254,679 participants. Metformin 
significantly reduced the occurrence of cognitive dysfunction in patients with 
T2D (HR 0.90; 95% CI [0.88, 0.92]). Compared with other hypoglycemic drugs, 
sulfonylureas also improved cognitive dysfunction (HR 0.92; 95% CI [0.88, 
0.95]). Thiazolidinediones gave no statistically significant improvement in 
cognitive dysfunction (HR 0.97; 95% CI [0.87, 1.07]). The use of insulin 
aggravated cognitive dysfunction (HR 1.34; 95% CI [1.24, 1.43]). In the subgroup 
analysis of various regions controlling for age, gender, education, diabetes 
course, complications, metformin administration and dosage, and follow-up time, 
metformin significantly improved cognitive dysfunction in patients in the 
Americas and Europe (HR 0.69; 95% CI [0.63, 0.74]), (HR 0.71; 95% CI [0.66, 
0.76], respectively), while metformin did not significantly improve cognitive 
dysfunction in Asian patients (HR 0.99; 95% CI [0.96, 1.01]).
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin significantly improved cognitive dysfunction in patients 
with T2D. Sulfonylureas also improved cognitive dysfunction. Thiazolidinediones 
had no significant effect on cognitive dysfunction. The use of insulin 
aggravated cognitive dysfunction. Metformin improved cognitive dysfunction more 
significantly in patients in the Americas and Europe than in Asia.
