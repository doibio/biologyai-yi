PURPOSE: To determine the separated and combined effects of metformin and 
exercise on insulin sensitivity and free-living glycemic control in overweight 
individuals with prediabetes/type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
METHODS: We recruited 16 adults with BMI of 32.7 ± 4.3 kg m-2 and insulin 
resistance (HOMA-IR 3.2 ± 0.4) under chronic metformin treatment 
(1234 ± 465 g day-1) enrolled in a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) 
program. Participants underwent four 72-h experimental trials in a 
random-counterbalanced order: (1) maintaining their habitual metformin treatment 
(MET); (2) replacing metformin treatment by placebo (CON); (3) placebo plus two 
HIIT sessions (EX + CON), and (4) metformin plus two HIIT sessions (MET + EX). 
We used intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) during 72 h 
in every trial to obtain interstitial fluid glucose area under the curve 
(IFGAUC) and the percentage of measurements over 180 mg dL-1 (% IFGPEAKS). 
Insulin sensitivity was assessed on the last day of each trial with HOMA-IR 
index and calculated insulin sensitivity (CSI) from intravenous glucose 
tolerance test.
RESULTS: IFGAUC was lower in MET + EX and MET than in CON (P = 0.011 and 
P = 0.025, respectively). In addition, IFGAUC was lower in MET + EX than in 
EX + CON (P = 0.044). %IFGPEAKS were only lower in MET + EX in relation to CON 
(P = 0.028). HOMA-IR and CSI were higher in CON in comparison with MET + EX 
(P = 0.011 and P = 0.022, respectively) and MET (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001, 
respectively). IFGAUC showed a significant correlation with HOMA-IR.
CONCLUSION: Intense aerobic exercise in patients with diabetes and prediabetes 
under metformin treatment reduces free-living 72-h blood hyperglycemic peaks. 
This may help to prevent the development of cardiovascular complications 
associated with diabetes.
