AIMS: The population of immigrants from the Middle East in Sweden show a higher 
prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to native Swedes. The exact reason 
for this is unknown. Here, we have performed metabolite profiling to investigate 
these differences.
METHODS: Metabolite profiling was conducted in Iraqi immigrants (n = 93) and 
native Swedes (n = 77) using two complementary mass spectrometry-based 
platforms. Differences in metabolite levels were compared after adjustment for 
confounding anthropometric, diet and clinical variables.
RESULTS: The Iraqi immigrant population were more obese (44.1 vs 24.7%, 
p < 0.05), but had a lower prevalence of hypertension (32.3 vs 54.8%, p < 0.01) 
than the native Swedish population. We detected 140 metabolites, 26 of which 
showed different levels between populations (q < 0.05,) after adjustment for 
age, sex, BMI, T2D and use of metformin. Twenty-two metabolites remained 
significant after further adjustment for HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta or insulin 
sensitivity index. Levels of polyunsaturated acylcarnitines (14:2 and 18:2) and 
fatty acid (18:2) were higher, whereas those of saturated and monounsaturated 
acylcarnitines (14:0, 18:1, and 8:1), fatty acids (12:0, 14:0, 16:0, and 18:1), 
uremic solutes (urate and quinate) and ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate) were 
lower in Iraqi immigrants. Further, levels of phospholipids were generally lower 
in the Iraqi immigrant population.
CONCLUSIONS: Our result suggests an overall beneficial lipid profile in Iraqi 
immigrants, despite a higher risk to develop T2D. Higher levels of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids may suggest differences in dietary pattern, which in 
turn may reduce the risk of hypertension.
