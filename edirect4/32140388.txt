Activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) have been widely accepted as a key 
precursor of excessive pancreatic fibrosis, which is a crucial hallmark of 
chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its formidable associated disease, pancreatic 
cancer (PC). Hence, anti-fibrotic therapy has been identified as a novel 
therapeutic strategy for treating CP and PC by targeting PSCs. Most of the 
anti-fibrotic agents have been limited to phase I/II clinical trials involving 
vitamin analogs, which are abundant in medicinal plants and have proved to be 
promising for clinical application. The use of phytomedicines, as new 
anti-fibrotic agents, has been applied to a variety of complementary and 
alternative approaches. The aim of this review was to present a focused update 
on the selective new potential anti-fibrotic agents, including curcumin, 
resveratrol, rhein, emodin, green tea catechin derivatives, metformin, eruberin 
A, and ellagic acid, in combating PSC in CP and PC models. It aimed to describe 
the mechanism(s) of the phytochemicals used, either alone or in combination, and 
the associated molecular targets. Most of them were tested in PC models with 
similar mechanism of actions, and curcumin was tested intensively. Future 
research may explore the issues of bioavailability, drug design, and 
nano-formulation, in order to achieve successful clinical outcomes with 
promising activity and tolerability.
