Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2D) have revealed a role for gut microbiota dysbiosis in driving this disease. 
This suggests the possibility that approaches to restore a healthy 
host-microbiota relationship might be a means of ameliorating T2D. Indeed, 
recent studies indicate that many currently used treatments for T2D are reported 
to impact gut microbiota composition. Such changes in gut microbiota may mediate 
and/or reflect the efficacy of these interventions. This article outlines the 
rationale for considering the microbiota as a central determent of development 
of T2D and, moreover, reviews evidence that impacting microbiota might be 
germane to amelioration of T2D, both in terms of understanding mechanisms that 
mediate efficacy of exiting T2D therapies and in developing novel treatments for 
this disorder.
