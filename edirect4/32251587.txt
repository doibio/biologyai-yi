Hyporheic zones are the water-saturated flow-through subsurfaces of rivers which 
are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple physical, 
biological, and chemical processes. Two factors playing a role in the hyporheic 
attenuation of organic contaminants are sediment bedforms (a major driver of 
hyporheic exchange) and the composition of the sediment microbial community. How 
these factors act on the diverse range of organic contaminants encountered 
downstream from wastewater treatment plants is not well understood. To address 
this knowledge gap, we investigated dissipation half-lives (DT50s) of 31 
substances (mainly pharmaceuticals) under different combinations of bacterial 
diversity and bedform-induced hyporheic flow using 20 recirculating flumes in a 
central composite face factorial design. By combining small-volume pore water 
sampling, targeted analysis, and suspect screening, along with quantitative 
real-time PCR and time-resolved amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing, we 
determined a comprehensive set of DT50s, associated bacterial communities, and 
microbial transformation products. The resulting DT50s of parent compounds 
ranged from 0.5 (fluoxetine) to 306 days (carbamazepine), with 20 substances 
responding significantly to bacterial diversity and four to both diversity and 
hyporheic flow. Bacterial taxa that were associated with biodegradation included 
Acidobacteria (groups 6, 17, and 22), Actinobacteria (Nocardioides and 
Illumatobacter), Bacteroidetes (Terrimonas and Flavobacterium) and diverse 
Proteobacteria (Pseudomonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and Xanthomonadaceae). 
Notable were the formation of valsartan acid from irbesartan and valsartan, the 
persistence of N-desmethylvenlafaxine across all treatments, and the 
identification of biuret as a novel transformation product of metformin. Twelve 
additional target transformation products were identified, which were persistent 
in either pore or surface water of at least one treatment, indicating their 
environmental relevance.
