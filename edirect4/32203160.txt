NCOA5 deficiency promotes a unique liver protumorigenic microenvironment through

Prevention and treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are 
presently limited, underscoring the necessity for further elucidating molecular 
mechanisms underlying HCC development and identifying new prevention and 
therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate a unique protumorigenic niche in the 
livers of Ncoa5+/- mouse model of HCC, which is characterized by altered 
expression of a subset of genes including p21WAF1/CIP1 and proinflammatory 
cytokine genes, increased putative hepatic progenitors, and expansions of 
activated and tissue-resident memory (TRM) CD8+ T lymphocytes, myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs), and alternatively activated M2 macrophages. 
Importantly, prophylactic metformin treatment reversed these characteristics 
including aberrant p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and subsequently reduced HCC 
incidence in Ncoa5+/- male mice. Heterozygous deletion of the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene 
alleviated the key features associated with the protumorigenic niche in the 
livers of Ncoa5+/- male mice. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis reveals that 
preneoplastic livers of Ncoa5+/- mice are similar to the livers of nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis patients as well as the adjacent noncancerous liver tissues of a 
subset of HCC patients with a relatively poor prognosis. Together, our results 
suggest that p21WAF1/CIP1 overexpression is essential in the development of 
protumorigenic microenvironment induced by NCOA5 deficiency and metformin 
prevents HCC development via alleviating p21WAF1/CIP1 overexpression and 
protumorigenic microenvironment.
