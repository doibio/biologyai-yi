BACKGROUND: The vast majority of individuals diagnosed with diabetes are 
low/middle income and may have access to only three of the 11 oral hypoglycemic 
medications (OHMs) due to cost: metformin intermediate release (IR) or extended 
release (ER), sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide), and 
pioglitazone. Sulfonylureas and pioglitazone have had significant controversy 
related to potential adverse events, but it remains unclear whether these 
negative outcomes are class, drug, or dose-related.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a narrative review of low-cost OHMs.
METHODS: We evaluated the maximum recommended (MAX) compared to the most 
effective (EFF) daily dose, time-to-peak change in HbA1c levels, and adverse 
events of low-cost oral hypoglycemic medications.
RESULTS: We found that the MAX was often greater than the EFF: metformin IR/ER 
(MAX: 2,550/2,000 mg, EFF: 1,500-2,000/1,500-2,000 mg), glipizide IR/ER (MAX: 
40/20 mg, EFF: 20/5 mg), glyburide (MAX: 20 mg, EFF: 2.5-5.0 mg), pioglitazone 
(MAX: 45 mg, EFF: 45 mg). Time-to-peak change in HbA1c levels occurred at weeks 
12-20 (sulfonylureas), 25-39 (metformin), and 25 (pioglitazone). Glimepiride was 
not associated with weight gain, hypoglycemia, or negative cardiovascular events 
relative to other sulfonylureas. Cardiovascular event rates did not increase 
with lower glyburide doses (p<0.05). Glimepiride and pioglitazone have been 
successfully used in renal impairment.
CONCLUSION: Metformin, glimepiride, and pioglitazone are safe and efficacious 
OHMs. Prescribing at the EFF rather than the MAX may avoid negative dose-related 
outcomes. OHMs should be evaluated as individual drugs, not generalized as a 
class, due to different dosing and adverse-event profiles; Glimepiride is the 
preferred sulfonylurea since it is not associated with the adverse events as 
others in its class.
