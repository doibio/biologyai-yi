The effects of metformin on a testicular torsion injury in adolescent rat testis 
after I/R were evaluated in the present study. Forty adolescent rats were 
divided into five groups with eight rats per group: a control group; a 
sham-operated group; an ischaemia group, where torsion was applied for 4 hr and 
testis was examined immediately after detorsion; an I/R group, where torsion was 
applied for 4 hr and the testis was examined 4 hr after detorsion; and an 
I/R + M group, where the metformin (300 mg/kg) administration was added to the 
identical procedures used for the I/R group. Spermatogenesis, basal membrane 
integrity and cleaved caspase-3 expression were assessed. The I/R + M group had 
a significantly higher Johnsen score than the I/R group (7.9 ± 0.1 vs. 
7.5 ± 0.2; p < .001; F-value = 14.2). Failure of basal membrane integrity was 
highest in the ischaemia group (45 ± 5) compared to the other groups (control 
group, 20 ± 5; sham-operated group, 16.6 ± 2.8), but not different between the 
I/R + M (31.6 ± 12.5) and the I/R groups (25 ± 3.5). Cleaved caspase-3 
expression was highest in the ischaemia group (73.5 ± 0.7), and significantly 
lower in the I/R + M group (33.4 ± 0.9) than the I/R group (58.5 ± 0.2; p < .05; 
F-value = 7.6). Metformin decreases testicular damage by exerting protection 
against the harmful effects of I/R on spermatogenesis and alleviating apoptosis 
in adolescent rat testis.
