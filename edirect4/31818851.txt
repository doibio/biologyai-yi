Obesity is associated with risk of colorectal adenoma (CRA) and colorectal 
cancer. The signaling pathway activated by metformin (LKB1/AMPK/mTOR) is 
implicated in tumor suppression in ApcMin/+ mice via metformin-induced reduction 
in polyp burden, increased ratio of pAMPK/AMPK, decreased pmTOR/mTOR ratio, and 
decreased pS6Ser235/S6Ser235 ratio in polyps. We hypothesized that metformin 
would affect colorectal tissue S6Ser235 among obese patients with recent history 
of CRA. A phase IIa clinical biomarker trial was conducted via the U.S. National 
Cancer Institute-Chemoprevention Consortium. Nondiabetic, obese subjects (BMI 
≥30) ages 35 to 80 with recent history of CRA were included. Subjects received 
12 weeks of oral metformin 1,000 mg twice every day. Rectal mucosa biopsies were 
obtained at baseline and end-of-treatment (EOT) endoscopy. Tissue S6Ser235 and 
Ki-67 immunostaining were analyzed in a blinded fashion using Histo score 
(Hscore) analysis. Among 32 eligible subjects, the mean baseline BMI was 34.9. 
Comparing EOT to baseline tissue S6Ser235 by IHC, no significant differences 
were observed. Mean (SD) Hscore at baseline was 1.1 (0.57) and 1.1 (0.51) at 
EOT; median Hscore change was 0.034 (P = 0.77). Similarly, Ki-67 levels were 
unaffected by the intervention. The adverse events were consistent with 
metformin's known side-effect profile. Among obese patients with CRA, 12 weeks 
of oral metformin does not reduce rectal mucosa pS6 or Ki-67 levels. Further 
research is needed to determine what effects metformin has on the target tissue 
of origin as metformin continues to be pursued as a colorectal cancer 
chemopreventive agent.
