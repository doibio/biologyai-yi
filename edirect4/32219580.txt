BACKGROUND: Lactate is a robust prognostic marker for the outcome of critically 
ill patients. Several small studies reported that metformin users have higher 
lactate levels at ICU admission without a concomitant increase in mortality. 
However, this has not been investigated in a larger cohort. We aimed to 
determine whether the association between lactate levels around ICU admission 
and mortality is different in metformin users compared to metformin nonusers.
METHODS: This cohort study included patients admitted to ICUs in northern 
Denmark between January 2010 and August 2017 with any circulating lactate 
measured around ICU admission, which was defined as 12 h before until 6 h after 
admission. The association between the mean of the lactate levels measured 
during this period and 30-day mortality was determined for metformin users and 
nonusers by modelling restricted cubic splines obtained from a Cox regression 
model.
RESULTS: Of 37,293 included patients, 3183 (9%) used metformin. The median 
(interquartile range) lactate level was 1.8 (1.2-3.2) in metformin users and 1.6 
(1.0-2.7) mmol/L in metformin nonusers. Lactate levels were strongly associated 
with mortality for both metformin users and nonusers. However, the association 
of lactate with mortality was different for metformin users, with a lower 
mortality rate in metformin users than in nonusers when admitted with similar 
lactate levels. This was observed over the whole range of lactate levels, and 
consequently, the relation of lactate with mortality was shifted rightwards for 
metformin users.
CONCLUSION: In this large observational cohort of critically ill patients, early 
lactate levels were strongly associated with mortality. Irrespective of the 
degree of hyperlactataemia, similar lactate levels were associated with a lower 
mortality rate in metformin users compared with metformin nonusers. Therefore, 
lactate levels around ICU admission should be interpreted according to metformin 
use.
