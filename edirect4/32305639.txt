ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae) leaves are used 
as an herbal antidiabetic remedy in several parts of the world. On Madagascar, 
both the bark and leaves are used for treatment of diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dilution series of ethanolic extracts of P. guajava 
leaves and bark were used for determining inhibitory activities against yeast 
α-glucosidase and porcine α-amylase. Skeletal muscle glucose uptake was measured 
using 2-deoxy-D-(1-3H)-glucose in murine C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Hepatic 
glucose-6-phosphatase activity in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells and triglyceride 
accumulation in murine 3T3-L1 adipocyte-like cells were assessed using Wako 
AutoKit Glucose assays and AdipoRed reagent, respectively. Cells were incubated 
for 18 h with the maximal non-toxic concentrations of the plant extracts 
determined by the lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay.
RESULTS: Ethanolic extracts of P. guajava leaf and bark inhibited α-glucosidase 
with IC50 values of 1.0 ± 0.3 and 0.5 ± 0.01 μg/mL, respectively. In the 
α-amylase inhibition assay, the ethanolic extract of bark of P. guajava showed 
an IC50 value of 10.6 ± 0.4 μg/mL. None of the extracts were able to reduce 
glucose-6-phosphatase activity in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. In contrast, P. 
guajava leaf extract significantly increased 2-deoxy-D-[1-3H]-glucose uptake in 
C2C12 muscle cells (161.4 ± 10.1%, p = 0.0015) in comparison to the dimethyl 
sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control, as did the reference compounds metformin 
(144.0 ± 7.7%, p = 0.0345) and insulin (141.5 ± 13.8%, p = 0.0495). Furthermore, 
P. guajava leaf and bark extracts, as well as the reference compound 
rosiglitazone, significantly enhanced triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells 
(252.6 ± 14.2%, p < 0.0001, 211.1 ± 12.7%, p < 0.0001, and 201.1 ± 9.2%, 
p < 0.0001, respectively) to levels higher than the DMSO vehicle control. 
Moreover, P. guajava leaf extract significantly enhanced the triglyceride 
accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells compared to rosiglitazone.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that P. guajava leaf and bark extracts can 
be used as a natural source of α-glucosidase inhibitors. In addition, the bark 
extract of P. guajava was an effective α-amylase inhibitor. Moreover, P. guajava 
leaf extract improved glucose uptake in muscle cells, while both leaf and bark 
extracts enhanced the triglyceride content in adipocytes in culture. P. guajava 
leaf and bark extracts may thus hypothetically have future applications in the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes.
