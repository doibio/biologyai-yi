BACKGROUND: Metformin is the first prescribed drug for hyperglycemia in type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Mainly by activating AMPK pathway, this drug exerts various 
functions that among them protective effects are of the interest.
PURPOSE: Herein, we aimed to gather data about the protective impacts of 
metformin against various natural or chemical toxicities.
RESULTS: An extensive search among PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar was 
conducted by keywords related to protection, toxicity, natural and chemical 
toxins and, metformin. Our literature review showed metformin alongside its 
anti-hyperglycemic effect has a wide range of anti-toxic effects against 
anti-tumour and routine drugs, natural and chemical toxins, herbicides and, 
heavy metals.
CONCLUSION: It is evident that metformin is a potent drug against the toxicity 
of a broad spectrum of natural, chemical toxic agents which is proved by a vast 
number of studies. Metformin mainly through AMPK axis can protect different 
organs against toxicities. Moreover, metformin preserves DNA integrity and can 
be an option for adjuvant therapy to ameliorate side effect of other 
therapeutics.
