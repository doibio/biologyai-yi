OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether patients with polycystic ovary syndrome 
(PCOS) are at increased risk for incident schizophrenia and whether PCOS 
treatment (clomiphene, cyproterone, or metformin) affects the incidence of 
schizophrenia.
METHODS: An overall of 7146 PCOS patients and 28,580 non-PCOS controls matched 
by age, index year, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score were included 
between 2000 and 2012 and followed up until 2013 using a validated nationally 
representative sample from Taiwan. Participants newly diagnosed as schizophrenia 
were defined as incidents. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the 
hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the schizophrenia 
incidence rate between the two studied groups.
RESULTS: PCOS patientsÂ were at increased risk of incident schizophrenia compared 
to non-PCOS controls after adjusting for age, CCI score, comorbidities, and 
different treatment options (0.49 versus 0.09 per 1000 person-years, HR: 6.93, 
95% CI: 3.25-14.7). After adjusting for above-mentioned covariates, metformin 
treatment had a protective effect against the incident schizophrenia compared to 
non-users (HR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.06-0.41). Also, treatment with clomiphene and 
cyproterone had only a limited impact on the incident schizophrenia.
CONCLUSION: This study shows PCOS patients are at increased risk of incident 
schizophrenia, and the metformin treatment has a protective effect against 
incident schizophrenia.
