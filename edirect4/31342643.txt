SHIP2 (Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5'-phosphatase 2) belongs to 
the family of 5'-phosphatases. It regulates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K)-mediated insulin signalling cascade by dephosphorylating the 5'-position 
of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to generate PtdIns(3,4)P2, suppressing the activity of the 
pathway. SHIP2 mouse models and genetic studies in human propose that increased 
expression or activity of SHIP2 contributes to the pathogenesis of the metabolic 
syndrome, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. This has raised great interest to 
identify SHIP2 inhibitors that could be used to design new treatments for 
metabolic diseases. This review summarizes the central mechanisms associated 
with the development of diabetic kidney disease, including the role of insulin 
resistance, and then moves on to describe the function of SHIP2 as a regulator 
of metabolism in mouse models. Finally, the identification of SHIP2 inhibitors 
and their effects on metabolic processes in vitro and in vivo are outlined. One 
of the newly identified SHIP2 inhibitors is metformin, the first-line medication 
prescribed to patients with type 2 diabetes, further boosting the attraction of 
SHIP2 as a treatment target to ameliorate metabolic disorders.
