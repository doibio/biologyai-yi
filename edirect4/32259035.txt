OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is one of the primary diagnoses for admission to home health 
care units. Although there are many studies about elderly diabetic patients, 
there are not many studies on home care patients with diabetes. The present 
study aims to analyze the current status of diabetic home care patients with 
their biochemical data and medications.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study, including 256 diabetic patients who 
were following up by the Home Health Unit of Istanbul Provincial Health 
Directorate Public Hospitals Services-2. In this study, we analyzed the current 
biochemical data of the patients with their medications.
RESULTS: In this study, 185 female (72.3%) and 71 male (27.7%) patients were 
recruited with the mean HbA1c of 8.25±1.77. Among these patients, 65% of them 
were using oral antidiabetic (OAD), and 58% were using insulin. There were 21 
(8.2%) patients who were not receiving any treatment. While patients who were 
using only oral antidiabetic have better A1c levels (A1c: 7.73±1.45), patients 
who were insülin using had HbA1c levels as high as the patients who were not 
using any medication. This may be due to the progression of diabetes, fear of 
hypoglycemia or insufficient insülin use. While metformin was the most commonly 
used OAD, with a 38% usage rate. When compared to HbA1c levels, there was no 
difference between the types of insulin used (p=0.167).
CONCLUSION: As a result, it is important to plan regular visits and personalized 
treatment by keeping in mind the benefits to risk ratios in home-care diabetic 
patients.
