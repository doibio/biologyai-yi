BACKGROUND: Few prospective studies have compared the cardiovascular benefits of 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 
(DPP-4) inhibitors. We aimed to clarify the efficacy of dapagliflozin versus 
sitagliptin for modulating cardiometabolic risk factors including high glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, hypoglycemia, and body weight.
METHODS: This prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, 
parallel-group trial enrolled 340 Japanese patients with early-stage type 2 
diabetes receiving metformin alone or no glucose-lowering agents, who were 
randomized to receive dapagliflozin or sitagliptin for 24 weeks. The primary 
endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved the composite endpoint of 
HbA1c level maintenance < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), avoidance of hypoglycemia 
(maintenance of sensor glucose ≥ 3.0 mmol/L or ≥ 54 mg/dL), and ≥ 3.0% body 
weight loss from baseline. Secondary endpoints included components of the 
primary endpoint, other metabolic indices, and glucose variability indices 
measured using flash glucose monitoring.
RESULTS: Clinical characteristics of patients were age, 58.1 ± 12.2 years; known 
duration of diabetes, 5.8 ± 6.1 years; body weight, 74.7 ± 14.2 kg; body mass 
index, 27.9 ± 4.1 kg/m2; and HbA1c level, 7.8 ± 0.8% at baseline. The 
achievement ratio of primary endpoint was significantly higher in the 
dapagliflozin group than in the sitagliptin group (24.4% vs. 13.8%, P < 0.05). 
While the rates of HbA1c level maintenance < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and avoidance of 
hypoglycemia were comparable between the groups (49.4 vs. 50.0% and 88.7 vs. 
92.3% for dapagliflozin vs. sitagliptin, respectively), body weight loss of 
≥ 3.0% was significantly achieved in the dapagliflozin group (54.4 vs. 19.6%, 
P < 0.001). Moreover, dapagliflozin was superior to sitagliptin regarding 
several secondary endpoints that modulate cardiometabolic risk, namely reducing 
fasting plasma glucose, insulin, uric acid, increasing high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, and suppressing the increase in serum creatinine and the decrease 
in estimated glomerular filtration rate. On the other hand, sitagliptin was 
superior to dapagliflozin in suppressing glucose variability.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to sitagliptin, dapagliflozin was significantly more 
effective at improving cardiometabolic risk factors, suggesting that SGLT2 
inhibitors might be more suitable than DPP-4 inhibitors for preventing 
cardiovascular events in patients with early-stage but inadequately controlled 
type 2 diabetes. Trial registration Trial number, UMIN000028014; registered on
