AIMS: Preserved vascular function represents a key prognostic factor in type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but data on vascular parameters in this patient cohort 
are scarce. Patients with T2DM often need more than one drug to achieve optimal 
glucose control. The aim of this study was to analyse the efficacy of two 
combination therapies on vascular function in subjects with T2DM.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective, randomized study included 97 subjects 
with T2DM. Subjects were randomized to either the combination therapy 
empagliflozin (E) 10 mg with linagliptin (L) 5 mg once daily or metformin (M) 
850 or 1000 mg twice daily with insulin glargine (I) once daily. At baseline and 
after 12 weeks, subjects had peripheral office and 24-h ambulatory blood 
pressure (BP) measurement and underwent vascular assessment by pulse wave 
analysis under office and ambulatory conditions. Office, 24-h ambulatory and 
central BP as well as pulse pressure (PP) decreased after 12 weeks of treatment 
with E + L, whereas no change was observed in M + I. There were greater 
decreases in 24-h ambulatory peripheral systolic (between-group difference: 
-5.2 ± 1.5 mmHg, P = 0.004), diastolic BP (-1.9 ± 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.036), and PP 
(-3.3 ± 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.007) in E + L than M + I. Central office systolic BP 
(-5.56 ± 1.9 mmHg, P = 0.009), forward pressure height of the pulse wave 
(-2.0 ± 0.9 mmHg, P = 0.028), 24-h ambulatory central systolic (-3.6 ± 1.4 mmHg, 
P = 0.045), diastolic BP (-1.95 ± 1.1 mmHg, P = 0.041), and 24-h pulse wave 
velocity (-0.14 ± 0.05m/s, P = 0.043) were reduced to a greater extent with 
E + L.
CONCLUSION: Beyond the effects on glycaemic control, the combination therapy of 
E + L significantly improved central BP and vascular function compared with the 
classic combination of M + I.
