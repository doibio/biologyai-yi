BACKGROUND/AIM: Episodes of non-severe hypoglycemia can be captured through 
diagnoses documented in the electronic medical record. We aimed to create a 
clinically useful prediction model for a severe hypoglycemia event, requiring an 
emergency department visit or hospitalization, in patients with Type 2 diabetes 
with a history of non-severe hypoglycemia.
METHODS: Using electronic medical record data from 50,439 patients with Type 2 
diabetes in one health system, number of severe hypoglycemia events and 
associated patient characteristics from 2006 to 2015 were previously defined. 
Using the landmarking method, a dynamic prediction model was built using the 
subset of 1876 patients who had a documented non-severe hypoglycemia diagnosis 
code, using logistic regression to obtain landmark-specific odds of severe 
hypoglycemia in this group. For model performance, the bootstrap procedure was 
employed for internal validation and area under the curve (AUC) and index of 
prediction accuracy (IPA) were calculated.
RESULTS: Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) was 
associated with increased odds ratio (OR) of severe hypoglycemia at 3 months (OR 
1.92 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.19-3.10 at HbA1c 5% (31 mmol/mol) and OR 
1.21, CI 1.03-1.41 at HbA1c 6%(42 mmol/mol).) History of non-severe hypoglycemia 
within the past 3 months increased odds for severe hypoglycemia (OR 2.58 95% CI 
1.80-3.70) as did Black race, insulin use with the past 3 months, and 
comorbidities. Metformin and sulfonlylurea use in the past 3 months, increasing 
age and body mass index had lower odds of a future severe hypoglycemia event. 
For the prediction model for 3 month risk of severe hypoglycemia, the AUC was 
0.890 (CI 0.843-0.907) and the IPA was 10.8% (CI 4.4% - 12.4%).
CONCLUSION: In patients with a documented diagnosis of non-severe hypoglycemia, 
a dynamic prediction model identifies patients with Type 2 diabetes with 3-month 
increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, allowing for preventive efforts, such as 
medication changes, at the point of care.
