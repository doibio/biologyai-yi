NADH provides electrons for aerobic ATP production. In cells deprived of oxygen 
or with impaired electron transport chain activity, NADH accumulation can be 
toxic. To minimize such toxicity, elevated NADH inhibits the classical 
NADH-producing pathways: glucose, glutamine, and fat oxidation. Here, through 
deuterium-tracing studies in cultured cells and mice, we show that 
folate-dependent serine catabolism also produces substantial NADH. Strikingly, 
when respiration is impaired, serine catabolism through methylene 
tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD2) becomes a major NADH source. In cells 
whose respiration is slowed by hypoxia, metformin, or genetic lesions, 
mitochondrial serine catabolism inhibition partially normalizes NADH levels and 
facilitates cell growth. In mice with engineered mitochondrial complex I 
deficiency (NDUSF4-/-), serine's contribution to NADH is elevated, and 
progression of spasticity is modestly slowed by pharmacological blockade of 
serine degradation. Thus, when respiration is impaired, serine catabolism 
contributes to toxic NADH accumulation.
