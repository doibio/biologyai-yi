The renal hemodynamic effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin are caused by 
post-glomerular vasodilatation rather than pre-glomerular vasoconstriction in 
metformin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes in the randomized, double-blind 
RED trial.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) improve hard renal outcomes 
in type 2 diabetes. This is possibly explained by the fact that SGLT2i normalize 
the measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) by increasing renal vascular 
resistance, as was shown in young people with type 1 diabetes and glomerular 
hyperfiltration. Therefore, we compared the renal hemodynamic effects of 
dapagliflozin with gliclazide in type 2 diabetes. The mGFR and effective renal 
plasma flow were assessed using inulin and para-aminohippurate clearances in the 
fasted state, during clamped euglycemia (5 mmol/L) and during clamped 
hyperglycemia (15 mmol/L). Filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance 
were calculated. Additionally, factors known to modulate renal hemodynamics were 
measured. In 44 people with type 2 diabetes on metformin monotherapy (Hemoglobin 
A1c 7.4%, mGFR 113 mL/min), dapagliflozin versus gliclazide reduced mGFR by 5, 
10, and 12 mL/min in the consecutive phases while both agents similarly improved 
Hemoglobin A1c (-0.48% vs -0.65%). Dapagliflozin also reduced filtration 
fraction without increasing renal vascular resistance, and increased urinary 
adenosine and prostaglandin concentrations. Gliclazide did not consistently 
alter renal hemodynamic parameters. Thus, beyond glucose control, SGLT2i reduce 
mGFR and filtration fraction in type 2 diabetes. The fact that renal vascular 
resistance was not increased by dapagliflozin suggests that this is due to 
post-glomerular vasodilation rather than pre-glomerular vasoconstriction.
