PCOS is already a prevalent endocrinopathy in adolescent girls, and its 
prevalence is rising further since, in essence, it is the result of a mismatch 
between an energy-sparing (epi)genetic background and a (relatively) obesogenic 
environment. This mismatch results in an excess of fat storage in ectopic 
depots, notably in the liver and viscera (= hepato-visceral, or central fat). 
There is still no FDA-approved treatment for adolescent PCOS. The prime aim 
should be a preferential loss of central fat, through lifestyle measures. 
Failure to sustain these measures is frequent, and the standard approach is to 
add an estroprogestagen contraceptive, even for girls who do not need 
contraception. Treatment with SPIOMET, a low-dose combination of spironolactone 
(to antagonize androgen and mineralocorticoid effects, and to activate BAT 
thereby raising energy expenditure), pioglitazone (to raise circulating HMW 
adiponectin concentrations) and metformin, is an alternative approach that holds 
the potential to revert the PCOS phenotype.
