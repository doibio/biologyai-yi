In recent years, the incidence of diabetes mellitus and cancer has increased 
sharply; indeed, these have become the two most important diseases threatening 
health and survival. Head and neck (HN) tumors are the sixth most common 
malignancies in humans. Numerous studies have shown that there are many common 
risk factors for diabetes mellitus and HN squamous cell carcinoma, including 
advanced age, poor diet and lifestyle, and environmental factors. However, the 
mechanism linking the two diseases has not been identified. A number of studies 
have shown that diabetes affects the development, metastasis, and prognosis of 
HN cancer, potentially through the associated hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia 
and insulin resistance, or chronic inflammation. More recent studies show that 
metformin, the first-line drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, can 
significantly reduce the risk of HN tumor development and reduce mortality in 
diabetic patients. Here, we review recent progress in the study of the 
relationship between diabetes mellitus and HN carcinogenesis, and its potential 
mechanisms, in order to provide a scientific basis for the early diagnosis and 
effective treatment of these diseases.
