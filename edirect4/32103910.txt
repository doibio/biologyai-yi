INTRODUCTION: It is not possible to recover from chronic diseases; however, a 
healthy lifestyle and correct adherence to therapy can avoid complications and 
co-morbidities. The aim of this study was the cross-sectional evaluation, by 
means of a questionnaire, of real-world data on the prevalence of non-adherence 
to metformin and atorvastatin oral therapies in a sample of patients that attend 
community pharmacies in the Piedmont Region. The secondary aim was to evaluate 
the presence of correlations between non-adherence and a number of variables 
detected by the questionnaire.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were gathered from face-to-face interviews in six 
community pharmacies in Piedmont. The questionnaire was divided into two 
sections: the first included the Morisky, Green and Levine Medication Adherence 
Questionnaire (MAQ) (to assess therapy adherence); the second included questions 
on gender, age, level of education and the pharmacy in which the questionnaire 
was administered. Comparisons between proportions and mean values were performed 
using the χ2 test. Modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors was 
used for multivariate analysis. The level of significance was fixed at 0.05, CI 
at 95%.
RESULTS: The sample analysed was composed of 408 subjects (receiving either 
metformin or atorvastatin). According to MAQ, 62 patients were non-adherent (15% 
of the total cohort). Crude and multivariate analysis did not show any 
statistically significant correlation between gender, age, level of education 
and non-adherence. It emerged that there was a correlation between non-adherence 
and being a customer of two of the pharmacies involved [PR = 3.31 (p=0.028) and 
PR = 3.11 (p=0.027)].
CONCLUSIONS: Community pharmacies can be an appropriate setting to identify 
non-adherent patients. Therefore, healthcare professionals could realize an 
integrated and structured intervention to improve adherence. However, MAQ could 
underestimate the number of non-adherent patients. Further studies to test the 
association between non-adherence prevalence and being the customer of a 
specific pharmacy should be performed.
