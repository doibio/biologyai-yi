Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased levels of inflammation and 
oxidative stress in patients. The aim of the present study was to test the 
hypothesis that aqueous extract of Cichorium intybus seeds (AECIS) would have 
add-on beneficial effect in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this 
double-blind randomized clinical study, 150 subjects were enrolled to assess the 
add-on efficacy and safety of AECIS in T2DM patients. The subjects were 
randomized (1:1) to the AECIS (n = 51) and placebo (n = 49) groups. The subjects 
in both groups continued to take prescribed doses of metformin. The 
standardization of AECIS was carried out by liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry and phytochemical analysis. The mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level 
in the AECIS and placebo groups at baseline was 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. 
Mean values of HbA1c at the end of 12 weeks of intervention were 7.42% in the 
AECIS group (a reduction of 1.18% from baseline) and 8.4% in the placebo group 
(mean reduction of 0.1% from baseline). Besides, significant reduction in 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypertriglyceridemia was seen in the AECIS 
group (p < .05). The study shows for the first time that AECIS supplementation 
ameliorates the disease progression and it is beneficial as a potential adjunct 
dietary supplement for the management of T2DM.
