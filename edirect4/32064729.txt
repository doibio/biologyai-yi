OBJECTIVE: In treatment options for type 2 diabetes in adolescents and youth 
(TODAY), 4.5% of obese youth clinically diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) had 
genetic variants consistent with maturity onset diabetes of youth (MODY) 
diagnosis. The course of IS and β-cell function in obese youth with MODY remains 
unknown. In this secondary analysis, we examined IS and β-cell function in MODY 
vs. non-MODY obese youth at randomization and over time.
METHODS: Genetic data in TODAY included 426 non-MODY (T2D) and 22 MODY youth (7 
glucokinase MODY mutation positive [GCK-MODY], 12 hepatocyte nuclear factor MODY 
mutation positive [HNF-MODY], 2 Insulin gene mutation [insulin (INS)-MODY], and 
1 Kruppel-like factor 11 [KLF11-MODY]). Oral glucose tolerance test 
(OGTT)-derived IS, C-peptide index, and β-cell function relative to IS oral 
disposition index (oDI) was measured at randomization, and over 24 months in 
addition to total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMWA).
RESULTS: At randomization, IS, total adiponectin, and HMWA were significantly 
higher in the two MODY groups than in non-MODY. β-cell function measured by 
C-peptide oDI was 3-fold higher in GCK-MODY than in HNF-MODY and 1.5-fold higher 
than non-MODY (P for both <.05). Glycemic failure rate was 75.0% in HNF-MODY, 
46.9% in non-MODY, and zero in GCK-MODY youth. While the changes in IS and oDI 
were not different among the three groups in the first 6 months, IS improved 
from 6 to 24 months in HNF-MODY vs GCK-MODY youth.
CONCLUSIONS: In TODAY, β-cell function at randomization was worse in obese 
HNF-MODY youth compared with GCK-MODY youth, while insulin sensitivity was worse 
in non-MODY compared with the other two MODY groups. Over time, IS showed the 
greatest improvement in HNF-MODY youth. This raises the possibility that TODAY 
therapeutic modalities of insulin sensitization in these obese HNF-MODY youth 
may have played a beneficial role.
