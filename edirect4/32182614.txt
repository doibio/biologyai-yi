BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX® (ODX) is a genomic assay that provides clinicians 
with a prediction of benefit of chemotherapy in node-negative, tamoxifen-treated 
breast cancer. However, the relationship between ODX recurrence score (RS) and 
diabetes, a common comorbidity in breast cancer patients, has been inadequately 
described in the literature. Specifically, the association of diabetes treatment 
with metformin and RS is inconclusive, with different studies reporting 
conflicting results. Because diabetes has been associated with higher RS, it has 
been suggested that management of diabetes with metformin in breast cancer 
patients may be associated with a lower RS.
OBJECTIVES: We studied a large cohort of early-stage, hormone-positive breast 
cancer patients to determine if there is an association between RS and metformin 
treatment.
METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively examined the medical records of 514 
early-stage, hormone-positive breast cancer patients who had oncotype testing 
performed between 2007 and 2017. Number (%) or median were used to describe the 
patients' characteristics between groups and were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis 
test at a significance level of 5%.
RESULTS: Of this cohort, 67 (13%) had a diabetes diagnosis at the time of breast 
cancer diagnosis, including both diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes. The median 
RS for non-diabetic patients was 16 and the median RS for diabetic patients was 
15. This difference was not significant, nor was there a statistical difference 
in RS between diabetic patients taking metformin (median RS = 15) and diabetic 
patients not taking metformin (median RS = 15). These results held true even 
when controlling for BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that neither diabetes diagnosis nor metformin use is 
associated with a difference in oncotype RS in this population of diabetic 
patients.
