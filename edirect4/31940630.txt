INTRODUCTION: Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs), the most abundant of 
all intracranial tumors, entail severe comorbidities. First-line therapy is 
transsphenoidal surgery, but subsequent pharmacological therapy is often 
required. Unfortunately, many patients are/become unresponsive to available 
drugs (somatostatin analogues [SSAs]/dopamine agonists), underscoring the need 
for new therapies. Statins are well-known drugs commonly prescribed to treat 
hyperlipidemia/cardiovascular diseases, but can convey additional beneficial 
effects, including antitumor actions. The direct effects of statins on normal 
human pituitary or PitNETs are poorly known. Thus, we aimed to explore the 
direct effects of statins, especially simvastatin, on key functional parameters 
in normal and tumoral pituitary cells, and to evaluate the combined effects of 
simvastatin with metformin (MF) or SSAs.
METHODS: Effects of statins in cell proliferation/viability, hormone secretion, 
and signaling pathways were evaluated in normal pituitary cells from a primate 
model (Papio anubis), tumor cells from corticotropinomas, somatotropinomas, 
nonfunctioning pituitary tumors, and PitNET cell-lines (AtT20/GH3-cells).
RESULTS: All statins decreased AtT20-cell proliferation, simvastatin showing 
stronger effects. Indeed, simvastatin reduced cell viability and/or hormone 
secretion in all PitNETs subtypes and cell-lines, and ACTH/GH/PRL/FSH/LH 
secretion (but not expression), in primate cell cultures, by modulating 
MAPK/PI3K/mTOR pathways and expression of key receptors (GH-releasing 
hormone-receptor/ghrelin-R/Kiss1-R) regulating pituitary function. Addition of 
MF or SSAs did not enhance simvastatin antitumor effects.
CONCLUSION: Our data reveal direct antitumor effects of simvastatin on 
PitNET-cells, paving the way to explore these compounds as a possible tool to 
treat PitNETs.
