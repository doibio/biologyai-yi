BACKGROUND: Research has established the development of steroid-induced 
hyperglycemia as a glucometabolic side effect of high-dose prednisone therapy. 
Few studies, however, have demonstrated preventative measures that could 
effectively curtail this side effect in susceptible patients undergoing 
high-dose prednisone treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To assess metformin's prophylactic effectiveness of 
prednisone-induced hyperglycemia among hematological cancer patients.
SETTING: Prospective randomized controlled trial conducted at the Kenyatta 
National Hospital Oncology Clinic and Wards, Nairobi, Kenya.
METHOD: Non-hyperglycemic hematological cancer patients on current or newly 
initiated high-dose prednisone-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive 
metformin 850 mg once then 850 mg twice daily for two successive weeks each or 
to the control group receiving the standard care. Patients were subjected to 
once weekly fasting and 2-h postprandial glucose measurements for four weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome of measure was the development of 
hyperglycemia defined by fasting capillary blood glucose values >5.6 mmol/L or 
2-h postprandial capillary blood glucose values >7.8 mmol/L.
RESULTS: Eighteen of 24 randomized patients completed the study (11 control and 
7 treatment). The proportion of the control subjects that developed prediabetes 
was 72.7% (95% confidence interval 45.5-90.9%) using fasting glucose and 54.5% 
(95% confidence interval 27.3-81.8%) using 2-h postprandial glucose. One 
treatment group participant developed prediabetes using fasting glucose, 
representing 14.3% (95% confidence interval 0-42.9%). No prediabetes was 
detected using the 2-h postprandial glucose. Analysis of mean fasting glucose 
between the two arms found no significant difference. However, significant 
differences in mean 2-h postprandial glucose were noted in week 2 (p = 0.0144), 
week 3 (p = 0.0095), and week 4 (p = 0.0074) of the study. Double dose (1700 mg) 
metformin was more effective in lowering blood glucose than single dose (850 mg) 
(p = 1.0000 (fasting), p = 0.4531(2-h postprandial).
CONCLUSION: Metformin's prophylactic effectiveness was demonstrated in this 
randomized study on new and previously exposed non-diabetic cancer patients on 
high-dose prednisone-based chemotherapy.
