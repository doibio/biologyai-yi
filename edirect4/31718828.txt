OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of metformin, rosiglitazone, and their 
combination in obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with insulin 
resistance.
DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trail.
SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital.
PATIENT(S): Obese Chinese women (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m2) with insulin 
resistance who fulfilled the Rotterdam criteria of PCOS.
INTERVENTION(S): In group 1, 68 patients administered metformin (1,500 mg/day); 
in group 2, 67 patients administered rosiglitazone (4 mg/day); in group 3, 69 
patients administered metformin (1,000 mg/day) and rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) for 
6 months, all with the same diet and regular exercise lifestyle recommendation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Average menstrual interval, anthropometric 
measurements, androgen-related parameters, and metabolic features of insulin, 
carbohydrates, and lipids, with intention-to-treat analysis.
RESULT(S): The baseline parameters showed no statistically significant 
differences. After the 6-month treatment, most participants showed an improved 
menstrual pattern. There were statistically significant decreases in acne 
scores, weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and serum 
testosterone. The metabolic indexes of insulin, carbohydrates, and lipids were 
improved obviously compared with the baseline in each group. Among the three 
groups, the patients administered 1,500 mg/day metformin experienced greater 
reductions in weight. However, the rosiglitazone users (alone or combined with 
metformin) showed a more notable decline in total cholesterol and triglyceride 
levels.
CONCLUSION(S): Considering the benefits of metformin on weight loss, high-dose 
metformin (1,500 mg/day) along with lifestyle modification should be recommended 
for obese, insulin-resistant women with PCOS. Rosiglitazone alone or combined 
with low-dosage metformin plus lifestyle modification should be considered for 
the women with abnormal lipid profiles.
