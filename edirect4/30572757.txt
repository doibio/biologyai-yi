BACKGROUND: Data on trends of diabetes medications use are sparse, outdated, and 
limited to prescription data. We determined trends in diabetes medication use 
among US individuals with diabetes during 2008-2015.
METHODS: We used 2008-2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to examine diabetes 
medication utilization among individuals aged â‰¥18 years with diabetes. 
Prescription medications were classified based on therapeutic class and subclass 
using Multum Lexicon database.
RESULTS: From 2008 to 2015, use of any diabetes medication (81.4% vs. 87%), 
metformin (47.8% vs. 59.0%), and insulin (23.0% vs. 31.0%) increased, whereas, 
use of sulfonylurea (36.0% vs. 29.0%) and thiazolidinedione (21% vs. 9.0%) 
declined. A linear increase was observed in the uptake of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
(DPP-4) inhibitors from 6.2% in 2008 to 12.4% in 2015; glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) receptor agonists from 2.5% in 2008 to 4.4% in 2015 and sodium glucose 
transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors from 0.8% in 2014 (the first SGLT2 inhibitors 
approval year) to 4.4% in 2015. Monotherapy use increased from 50.6% to 56.4% 
during 2008-2015, while triple therapy use declined.
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin, insulin and sulfonylureas remained the top-three 
prescribed classes of diabetes medications. Increased use of DPP-4 inhibitors, 
GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors was offset by decline in TZDs use.
