BACKGROUND: Prediabetes is a highly prevalent health problem with a high risk of 
complications and progression to type 2 diabetes (T2D). The goals of this study 
were to evaluate the effect of the combination of 
lingaliptin + metformin + lifestyle on glucose tolerance, pancreatic β-cell 
function and T2D incidence in patients with prediabetes.
METHODS: A single center parallel double-blind randomized clinical trial with 
24 months of follow-up in patients with impaired glucose tolerance plus two T2D 
risk factors which were randomized to linagliptin 5 mg + metformin 1700 mg 
daily + lifestyle (LM group) or metformin 1700 mg daily + lifestyle (M group). 
Primary outcomes were regression to normoglycemia and T2D incidence; glucose 
levels and pancreatic β-cell function were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: Subjects were screened for eligibility by OGTT and 144 patients with 
prediabetes were randomized to LM group (n = 74) or M group (n = 70); 52 and 36 
participants in the LM group and 52 and 27 participants in the M group, 
completed the 12 and 24 months of treatment, respectively; average follow-up was 
17 ± 6 and 18 ± 7 months in M and LM group, respectively. Glucose levels during 
OGTT improved more in LM group. OGTT disposition index (DI) improved 
significantly better during the first months in LM group, increasing from 1·31 
(95% CI: 1·14-1·49) to 2·41 (95% CI: 2.10-2.72) and to 2.07 (95% CI: 1.82-2.31) 
at 6 and 24 months in LM group vs from 1.21 (95% CI: 0.98-1.34) to 1.56 (95% CI: 
1.17-1.95) and to 1.72 (95% CI: 1.45-1.98) at 6 and 24 months in M group 
(p < .05). T2D incidence was higher in M group in comparison to LM group (HR 
4.0, 95% CI: 1.24-13.04, p = .020). The probability of achieving normoglycemia 
was higher in LM group (OR 3.26 CI 95% 1.55-6.84). No major side effects were 
observed during the study.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of linagliptin, metformin and lifestyle improved 
significantly glucose metabolism and pancreatic β-cell function, and reduced T2D 
incidence in subjects with prediabetes as compared to metformin and lifestyle.
