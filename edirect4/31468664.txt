AIMS: To determine the effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, 
sitagliptin, on gastric emptying (GE) of a high-carbohydrate meal and associated 
glycaemic and blood pressure (BP) responses in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with T2DM (nine men, five women; age 
67.8 ± 1.5 years; body mass index 31.2 ± 0.9 kg/m2 ; T2DM duration: 
4.2 ± 0.9 years; glycated haemoglobin: 46 ± 1.8 mmol/mol [6.4% ± 0.2%]), managed 
by diet and/or metformin, underwent concurrent measurements of GE, BP and plasma 
glucose for 240 minutes after ingestion of a radiolabelled mashed potato meal 
after receiving sitagliptin (100 mg) or placebo in randomized, double-blind, 
crossover fashion on 2 consecutive days.
RESULTS: Sitagliptin reduced postprandial plasma glucose (P < .005) without 
affecting GE (P = .88). The magnitude of the glucose-lowering effect (change in 
incremental area under the curve0-240 min from placebo to sitagliptin) was 
related to GE (kcal/min) on placebo (r = 0.68, P = .008) There was a comparable 
fall in systolic BP (P = .80) following the meal, with no difference between the 
2 days.
CONCLUSIONS: In T2DM, while sitagliptin has no effect on either GE or 
postprandial BP, its ability to lower postprandial glucose are dependent on the 
basal rate of GE.
