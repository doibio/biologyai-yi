Objectives: Our aim was to systematically identify and appraise 
cost-effectiveness studies of metformin in prediabetic subjects.Methods: A 
systematic literature review was conducted and reported according to standard 
guidlines. The search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, International Society for 
Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) presentation database and the 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) and Center for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) 
registries. All cost-effectiveness studies assessing metformin in prediabetic 
patients were included.Results: Twenty-three reports were included. Metformin 
and intensive lifestyle changes (ILC) interventions were always cost-effective 
compared to placebo. ILC was cost-effective and sometimes dominant compared to 
metformin. Metformin was cost-saving compared to ILC in the short and 
medium-term. Although, in the long term, metformin was more expensive than ILC 
in terms of direct medical costs, when indirect non-medical costs are included, 
metformin less expensive than ILC. One study reported that for patients with 
Body Mass Index (BMI) higher than 30 kg/m2, metformin is a cost-effective 
strategy compared to placebo and ILC. However, this finding was not confirmed by 
other retrieved studies.Conclusion: ILC is cost-effective compared to metformin 
and, both of them are cost-effective compared to placebo. Metformin may be 
cost-saving in the short- to medium-term and possibly in the long-term.
