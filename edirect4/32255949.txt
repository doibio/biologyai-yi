INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes mellitus is one of the most common conditions 
complicating pregnancy. Vitamin D deficiency is closely associated with 
gestational diabetes mellitus.
OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on diabetic 
pregnant women with vitamin D deficiency.
METHODS: This randomized controlled study was conducted with 100 diabetic 
pregnant women. They were randomized into group A and group B. Group A were 
screened for vitamin D deficiency once diagnosed with GDM of which 40 were found 
to be deficient and allotted to group D (n = 40) and were supplemented with 
60,000 units of vitamin D3 per month. Group B were given routine antenatal care 
and were screened for vitamin D deficiency when they were admitted for delivery, 
and 39 of them were found to have vitamin D deficiency and were studied as 
control group C (n = 39). Ten women in both the groups had normal levels of 
vitamin D, and one of them was excluded from the study as she had molar 
pregnancy. The vitamin D supplemented group D and the control group C were 
matched for age and parity at the baseline.
RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the mean insulin and metformin 
requirements in both the supplemented and control groups. Vitamin D 
supplementation did not improve the glycaemic control in diabetic pregnant 
women.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation did not decrease insulin resistance or 
improve the glycaemic control in diabetic pregnant women with vitamin D 
deficiency.
