OBJECTIVE: Previous work has suggested that metformin may possess antineoplastic 
properties. This study aims to assess the effect of metformin on the growth of 
sporadic vestibular schwannomas.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed on patients presenting with 
radiologically confirmed vestibular schwannomas to Stanford medical center 
between January 1990 and October 2018. Patients who received metformin during 
the follow-up period were included and were compared with the control group who 
were not receiving metformin. Tumor progression and hearing loss are primary and 
secondary outcomes, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 149 patients were analyzed, with 42 patients receiving 
metformin. The mean age at presentation is 69.6 (±11.7) years. There are 69 
(46.3%) females and 80 (53.7%) males and there is no significant age difference 
between the groups. Tumor size at presentation is similar between both groups, 
8 mm (4-13) in control group and 7.5 mm (4-14) in metformin group. The average 
follow-up period is 34.2 months (18.3-57.8) and 30.3 months (13.6-69.8) in the 
metformin and control cohorts, respectively, and they are not significantly 
different. No significant differences between both groups were found in final 
American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery hearing outcome or 
poor audiogram outcome. Metformin users are significantly less likely to present 
with tumor growth at final follow-up compared with nonmetformin users (28.6 
versus 49.5%, respectively; p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary result suggests metformin may reduce vestibular 
schwannoma tumor growth rate and shows potential promise as a novel 
chemotherapeutic agent. Further studies are needed to validate this finding.
