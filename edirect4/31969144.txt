BACKGROUND: Although a variety of antidiabetic drugs have significant protective 
action on the cardiovascular system, it is still unclear which antidiabetic 
drugs can improve ventricular remodeling and fundamentally delay the process of 
heart failure. The purpose of this network meta-analysis is to compare the 
efficacy of sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, 
metformin (MET), sulfonylurea (SU) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in improving 
left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and/or 
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: We searched articles published before October 18, 2019, regardless of 
language or data, in 4 electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library 
and Web of Science. We included randomized controlled trials in this network 
meta-analysis, as well as a small number of cohort studies. The differences in 
the mean changes in left ventricular echocardiographic parameters between the 
treatment group and control group were evaluated.
RESULTS: The difference in the mean change in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) 
between GLP-1 agonists and placebo in treatment effect was greater than zero 
(MD = 2.04% [0.64%, 3.43%]); similar results were observed for the difference in 
the mean change in LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) between SGLT-2 inhibitors 
and placebo (MD = - 3.3 mm [5.31, - 5.29]), the difference in the mean change in 
LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) between GLP-1 agonists and placebo 
(MD = - 4.39 ml [- 8.09, - 0.7]); the difference in the mean change in E/e' 
between GLP-1 agonists and placebo (MD = - 1.05[- 1.78, - 0.32]); and the 
difference in the mean change in E/e' between SGLT-2 inhibitors and placebo 
(MD = - 1.91[- 3.39, - 0.43]).
CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1 agonists are more significantly associated with improved 
LVEF, LVESV and E/e', SGLT-2 inhibitors are more significantly associated with 
improved LVEDD and E/e', and DPP-4 inhibitors are more strongly associated with 
a negative impact on LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) than are placebos. SGLT-2 
inhibitors are superior to other drugs in pairwise comparisons.
