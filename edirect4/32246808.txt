The purpose was to determine the role of AMPK activation in the renal metabolic 
response to sepsis, the development of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) 
and on survival. In a prospective experimental study, 167 10- to 12-week-old 
C57BL/6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and human proximal 
tubule epithelial cells (TEC; HK2) were exposed to inflammatory mix (IM), a 
combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). 
Renal/TEC metabolic fitness was assessed by monitoring the expression of drivers 
of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the rates of utilization of 
OXPHOS/glycolysis in response to metabolic stress, and mitochondrial function by 
measuring O2 consumption rates (OCR) and the membrane potential (Δψm ). 
Sepsis/IM resulted in AKI, increased mortality, and in renal AMPK activation 
6-24 hours after CLP/IM. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK with 
5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) or metformin during sepsis 
improved the survival, while AMPK inhibition with Compound C increased 
mortality, impaired mitochondrial respiration, decreased OCR, and disrupted TEC 
metabolic fitness. AMPK-driven protection was associated with increased Sirt 3 
expression and restoration of metabolic fitness. Renal AMPK activation in 
response to sepsis/IM is an adaptive mechanism that protects TEC, organs, and 
the host by preserving mitochondrial function and metabolic fitness likely 
through Sirt3 signaling.
