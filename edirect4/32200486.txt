PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic value of IGF-1R expression on circulating 
tumor cells (CTCs) in a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing 
chemotherapy plus metformin with chemotherapy alone in metastatic breast cancer 
(MBC) patients.
METHODS: CTCs were collected at baseline and at the end of chemotherapy. An 
automated sample preparation and analysis system (CellSearch) were customized 
for detecting IGF-1R expression. The prognostic role of CTC count and IGF-1R was 
assessed for PFS and OS by univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: Seventy-two out of 126 randomized patients were evaluated: 57% had ≥ 1 
IGF-1R positive CTC and 37.5% ≥ 4 IGF-1R negative cells; 42% had CTC 
count ≥ 5/7.5 ml. At univariate analysis, the number of IGF-1R negative CTCs was 
strongly associated with risk of progression and death: HR 1.93 (P = 0.013) and 
3.65 (P = 0.001), respectively; no association was detected between number of 
IGF-1R positive CTCs and PFS or OS (P = 0.322 and P = 0.840). The prognostic 
role of CTC count was confirmed: HR 1.69, P = 0.042 for PFS and HR 2.80 for OS, 
P = 0.002. By multivariate analysis, the prognostic role of the number of IGF-1R 
negative CTCs was maintained, while no residual prognostic role of CTC count or 
number of IGF-1R positive cells was found.
CONCLUSION: Loss of IGF-1R in CTCs is associated with a significantly worse 
outcome in MBC patients. This finding supports further evaluation for the role 
of IGF-1R on CTCs to improve patient stratification and to implement new 
targeted strategies.
