BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the potential association of 
exposure to metformin therapy with the risk of hip fracture in adult patients 
with type II diabetes. We included patients with diabetes who were registered in 
the 2010 sample cohort database of the National Health Insurance Service in 
South Korea.
METHODS: The patients who had been prescribed continuous oral metformin therapy 
for a 1-year period in 2010 were defined as the metformin group, while those who 
were not prescribed metformin during the same period were classified as the 
control group. The primary endpoint of this study was the development of hip 
fracture between January 2011 and December 2015.
RESULTS: A total of 64,878 patients (31,300 patients in the metformin group and 
32,439 patients in the control group) were included in this study. Among those, 
1655 patients (2.6%) had experienced a hip fracture. After a propensity score 
matching, a total of 37,378 patients (18,689 patients in each group) were 
included in the analysis. Using a time-dependent Cox regression analysis on the 
propensity score-matched cohort, the exposure to metformin was not significantly 
associated with the development of hip fracture compared to the control group 
(hazard ratio: 1.00, 95% confidence interval: 0.86 to 1.16; P = 0.985). Similar 
results were observed using sensitivity analysis of a multivariable 
time-dependent Cox regression model of the entire cohort (hazard ratio: 0.78, 
95% confidence interval: 0.36 to 1.69; P = 0.525).
CONCLUSIONS: This population-based cohort study in South Korea showed that there 
was no significant association between the exposure to metformin therapy and hip 
fracture in patients with type II diabetes mellitus.
