An elevated intracellular NADH:NAD+ ratio, or 'reductive stress', has been 
associated with multiple diseases, including disorders of the mitochondrial 
electron transport chain. As the intracellular NADH:NAD+ ratio can be in near 
equilibrium with the circulating lactate:pyruvate ratio, we hypothesized that 
reductive stress could be alleviated by oxidizing extracellular lactate to 
pyruvate. We engineered LOXCAT, a fusion of bacterial lactate oxidase (LOX) and 
catalase (CAT), which irreversibly converts lactate and oxygen to pyruvate and 
water. Addition of purified LOXCAT to the medium of cultured human cells with a 
defective electron transport chain decreased the extracellular lactate:pyruvate 
ratio, normalized the intracellular NADH:NAD+ ratio, upregulated glycolytic ATP 
production and restored cellular proliferation. In mice, tail-vein-injected 
LOXCAT lowered the circulating lactate:pyruvate ratio, blunted a 
metformin-induced rise in blood lactate:pyruvate ratio and improved NADH:NAD+ 
balance in the heart and brain. Our study lays the groundwork for a class of 
injectable therapeutic enzymes that alleviates intracellular redox imbalances by 
directly targeting circulating redox-coupled metabolites.
