Metformin (Met) can improve atherosclerosis (As). Abnormal endothelin receptors 
[including endothelin type A (ETA) or type B (ETB) receptor] in vascular smooth 
muscle cells (VSMCs) are involved in As. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is an 
independent risk factor for As. The present study was designed to test our 
hypothesis that Met inhibits the upregulation of endothelin receptors induced by 
homocysteine (Hcy) in VSMCs. Rat superior mesenteric artery (SMA) without 
endothelium, as an in vitro model, was cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h in 
the presence of Hcy with or without Met or nicotinamide (Nic). In vivo, rats 
received subcutaneous injections of Hcy in the presence or absence of Met or Nic 
for 3 weeks. Levels of protein expression were determined by Western blotting. 
The contractile responses to sarafotoxin 6c (an ETB receptor agonist) or ET-1 
(an ETA/ ETB receptor agonist) were studied using a sensitive myograph. The 
blood pressure of rats was measured using a noninvasive tail-cuff 
plethysmography method. The results showed that Met could significantly inhibit 
the Hcy-induced upregulation of endothelin receptors (including ETA and ETB 
receptor) protein expression and endothelin receptor-mediated vasoconstriction, 
and it recovered the Hcy-induced decrease in silent information regulator 1 
(Sirt1) in a dosage-dependent manner in SMA. However, Nic (a Sirt1 inhibitor) 
recovered the levels of Met-inhibited endothelin receptors and acetylated p65. 
Furthermore, the in vivo results showed that Met not only significantly the 
inhibited HHcy-induced upregulation of endothelin receptors and acetylated p65 
but also recovered the HHcy-induced decrease in Sirt1 in a dosage-dependent 
manner in SMA. In addition, Met significantly inhibited the HHcy-induced blood 
pressure elevation. However, these effects were reverted by Nic. In conclusion, 
these data demonstrated that Met inhibited the Hcy-induced increase in 
endothelin receptor expression by activating Sirt1 and then inhibiting NF-κB in 
VSMCs. These findings may provide insights into the mechanism underlying of 
Met-treated cardiovascular diseases induced by Hcy.
