This study aims to verify in experimental models of hyperglycemia induced by 
streptozotocin (STZ-DM) to what degree the high competition between unlabeled 
glucose and metformin (MET) treatment might affect the accuracy of cancer FDG 
imaging. The study included 36 "control" and 36 "STZ-DM" Balb/c mice, undergoing 
intraperitoneal injection of saline or streptozotocin, respectively. Two-weeks 
later, mice were subcutaneously implanted with breast (4 T1) or colon (CT26) 
cancer cells and subdivided in three subgroups for treatment with water or with 
MET at 10 or 750 mg/Kg/day. Two weeks after, mice were submitted to micro-PET 
imaging. Enzymatic pathways and response to oxidative stress were evaluated in 
harvested tumors. Finally, competition by glucose, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and the 
fluorescent analog 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose 
(2-NBDG) on FDG uptake was studied in 4 T1 and CT26 cultured cells. STZ-DM 
slightly decreased cancer volume and FDG uptake rate (MRF). More importantly, it 
also abolished MET capability to decelerate lesion growth and MRF. This 
metabolic reprogramming closely agreed with the activity of hexose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase within the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, co-incubation with 2DG 
virtually abolished FDG and 2-NBDG uptake within the endoplasmic reticulum in 
cultured cells. These data challenge the current dogma linking FDG uptake to 
glycolytic flux and introduce a new model to explain the relation between 
glucose analogue uptake and hexoses reticular metabolism. This selective fate of 
FDG contributes to the preserved sensitivity of PET imaging in oncology even in 
chronic moderate hyperglycemic conditions.
