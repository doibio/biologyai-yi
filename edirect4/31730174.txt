CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent disorder in adolescent 
girls, purportedly driven by hepato-visceral fat excess, and often followed by 
subfertility and type 2 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: We studied the baseline microRNA (miRNA) profile of girls with PCOS, 
and the effects of a randomized treatment with an oral contraceptive (OC) or 
with spironolactone-pioglitazone-metformin (SPIOMET, aiming at loss of 
hepato-visceral fat excess) for 1 year.
DESIGN & PATIENTS: The miRNA profile was assessed by RNA sequencing in girls 
with PCOS who had participated in a randomized, open-label, single-center, pilot 
study (n = 31; age 15.7 years, body mass index (BMI) 23.1 kg/m2). Healthy age- 
and BMI-matched girls (n = 13) served as controls. Differentially expressed 
miRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR in the entire study population. Post-treatment 
ovulation rates were assessed by salivary progesterone in PCOS girls.
SETTING: Endocrinology Department, University Hospital.
RESULTS: Girls with PCOS, compared with controls, had markedly reduced 
concentrations of circulating miR-451a, miR-652-3p, miR-106b-5p, and miR-206; 
pathway enrichment analysis showed that these miRNAs target genes involved in 
energy homeostasis and cell cycle control. In the present study, miR-451a could 
diagnose PCOS with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. SPIOMET (but not OC) 
was accompanied by on-treatment normalization of the miRNA profile in girls with 
PCOS; miR-451a concentrations after 1 year on OC or SPIOMET treatment associated 
closely (r = 0.66; P < .0001) with post-treatment ovulation rates.
CONCLUSION: SPIOMET treatment for 1 year normalizes the miRNA profile of girls 
with PCOS. Circulating miR-451a may become a biomarker to guide the diagnosis 
and treatment of PCOS in adolescence.
