PURPOSE: The ovarian cancer risk factors of age and ovulation are curious 
because ovarian cancer incidence increases in postmenopausal women, long after 
ovulations have ceased. To determine how age and ovulation underlie ovarian 
cancer risk, we assessed the effects of these risk factors on the ovarian 
microenvironment.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Aged C57/lcrfa mice (0-33 months old) were generated to 
assess the aged ovarian microenvironment. To expand our findings into human 
aging, we assembled a cohort of normal human ovaries (n = 18, 21-71 years old). 
To validate our findings, an independent cohort of normal human ovaries was 
assembled (n = 9, 41-82 years old).
RESULTS: We first validated the presence of age-associated murine ovarian 
fibrosis. Using interdisciplinary methodologies, we provide novel evidence that 
ovarian fibrosis also develops in human postmenopausal ovaries across two 
independent cohorts (n = 27). Fibrotic ovaries have an increased CD206+:CD68+ 
cell ratio, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and profibrotic DPP4+αSMA+ fibroblasts. 
Metformin use was associated with attenuated CD8+ T-cell infiltration and 
reduced CD206+:CD68+ cell ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support a novel hypothesis that unifies the primary 
nonhereditary ovarian cancer risk factors through the development of ovarian 
fibrosis and the formation of a premetastatic niche, and suggests a potential 
use for metformin in ovarian cancer prophylaxis.See related commentary by
