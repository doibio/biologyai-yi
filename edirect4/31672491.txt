Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is an aggressive pediatric tumor treated with intensive 
cytotoxic chemotherapies. Overall survival for metastatic or relapsed disease is 
only 20-30%. Metformin has long been an attractive therapeutic option for EwS, 
but hypoxia limits its efficacy. Through a systematic integration of drug 
combination screening, bioinformatics analyses, functional and in vivo studies, 
and correlation with clinical outcome, we identified another known drug, 
imatinib that could augment the in vivo anti-tumor capacity of metformin by 
attenuating tumor hypoxic response. This drug combination regimen widely 
suppressed multiple dominant mechanisms in EwS genesis, growth, and metastasis, 
including key EWS-FLI1 downstream targets that converge into the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
signaling pathway. In addition, the combination significantly enhanced 
inhibition on tumor cell proliferation by standard EwS chemotherapy drugs, 
including cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. This suggests a potential clinical 
benefit of the metformin/imatinib combination by allowing the reduction in dose 
intensity of standard chemotherapy without compromising survival outcome and 
represents a potential faster track application for EwS patients.
