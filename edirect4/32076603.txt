The role of IR and metabolic disorders has become a crucial topic of study in 
the pathogenesis of PCOS. Adipose tissue is an important target organ of 
insulin, and adipose IR plays an important role in the occurrence and 
development of PCOS. This study seeks to investigate the role of adipose IR in 
the development of PCOS and to examine its relationship with circulating 
betatrophin levels in women with PCOS. A cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of 
women with PCOS and healthy women was performed in this study. Serum betatrophin 
concentrations were measured by ELISA. Adipose IR was calculated using the 
product of fasting insulin and FFA concentrations, and the relationship between 
adipose IR, circulating betatrophin, and other parameters was analyzed. Adipose 
IR in women with PCOS was significantly higher than that in controls. We found 
that women with PCOS who have adipose IR (adipose IR ≥ 55) have a higher BMI and 
higher blood glucose, insulin, PRL, FFA, TG, HOMA-IR, AUCglucose, AUCinsulin, 
VAIfemale, and BAI levels than PCOS-afflicted women without adipose IR, while 
M-values, and SHBG and LH levels were lower. In women with PCOS, serum 
betatrophin levels were significantly increased compared with controls. Adipose 
IR negatively correlated with M values and positively with circulating 
betatrophin levels in the study population. After metformin treatment, 
circulating betatrophin levels and adipose IR in women with PCOS were 
significantly decreased compared with pretreatment. Adipose IR is associated 
with betatrophin levels in women with PCOS. The combination of adipose IR and 
circulating betatrophin measurements may be significant for screening patients 
with PCOS.
