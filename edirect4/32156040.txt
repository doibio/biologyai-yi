Doxorubicin (DOX) is widely used to treat many types of cancer; however, it is 
associated with chemotherapy-related complications such as cognitive 
dysfunction, known as chemobrain. Chemobrain affects up to 75% of cancer 
survivors, and there are currently no available therapeutic options. This study 
aims to examine whether metformin (MET) can protect against the neurotoxicity 
caused by DOX treatment. Forty male rats were divided into four groups (10 
rats/group): control, DOX, DOX + MET, and MET. Rats treated with DOX received 
five doses of 4 mg/kg DOX weekly (cumulative dose: 20 mg/kg). For the DOX-MET 
and MET groups, MET (3 mg/mL) was dissolved in drinking water. Behavioral and 
glucose tests were performed one day after treatment was completed. We found DOX 
(4 mg/kg/week, 5 weeks) caused learning and memory impairment in the Y-maze, 
novel object recognition, and elevated plus maze behavioral tests. MET did not 
rescue these DOX-induced memory impairments. Neither DOX nor MET nor MET + DOX 
altered glucose levels following the treatment. In summary, DOX treatment is 
associated with memory impairment in rats, but MET does not rescue this 
cognitive dysfunction.
