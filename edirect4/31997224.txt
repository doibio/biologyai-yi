INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress plays a central role in the development and 
progression of vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM). We have previously shown that markers of glucose variability evaluated 
by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) are positively associated with oxidative 
stress in patients with T2DM. However, the evaluation of the glycemic 
variability by CGM remains a time- and money-consuming procedure. Therefore, 
this study investigated the independent correlates of oxidative stress among 
various other clinical markers routinely measured in primary care.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study with 234 T2DM patients 
to examine which clinical variables, including 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG) 
and glycated albumin (GA), were independently associated with oxidative stress. 
Oxidative stress was measured using the diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites 
(d-ROMs) test. The relationships between d-ROMs and clinical factors, such as 
blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 1,5-AG, GA, lipid parameters, and 
blood pressure, were examined.
RESULTS: Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that 1,5-AG (inversely), 
GA, triglycerides, use of metformin and being female were independently 
associated with d-ROMs. When patients with T2DM were stratified into two groups 
with HbA1c < 8.0% and HbA1c ≥ 8.0%, 1,5-AG (inversely), HbA1c, use of metformin 
and being female were independently associated with d-ROMs in diabetes patients 
with HbA1c < 8.0%, whereas GA, fasting plasma glucose and being female were 
independently associated with d-ROMs in patients with HbA1c ≥ 8.0%.
CONCLUSION: Our present study suggests that 1,5-AG and GA are the strongest 
correlates of oxidative stress in patients with well and poorly controlled T2DM, 
respectively.
