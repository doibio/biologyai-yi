BACKGROUND: Metformin reduces glucose uptake in physiologic tissues and has been 
shown to affect non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metabolism. We hypothesized 
that positron emission tomography (PET) scans could detect the impact of 
metformin on glucose uptake in NSCLC and we sought to test this hypothesis in a 
prospective clinical trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-blinded phase II clinical trial was performed 
with subjects randomized 6:1 to 3 to 4 weeks of metformin versus placebo for 
inoperable early-stage NSCLC. PET scans were performed at baseline, 
mid-treatment (after 2 wk study medication), and 6 months postradiation. The 
primary endpoint of the trial was tumor metabolic response to metformin by 
PERCIST before definitive radiation. Stereotactic body radiotherapy to 50 Gy in 
4 fractions was used for peripheral tumors and 70 Gy in 10 fractions for central 
tumors.
RESULTS: There were 14 subjects randomized to the metformin and 1 to placebo. 
Histologies were 60% adenocarcinoma, 33.3% squamous cell carcinoma, and 6.7% 
poorly differentiated carcinoma. At mid-treatment PET scan, 57% of subjects 
randomized to metformin met PERCIST criteria for metabolic response, of which 
75% had progressive metabolic disease and 25% had partial metabolic response, 
whereas the placebo subject had stable metabolic disease. At 6 months, the 
metformin arm had 69% complete metabolic response, 23% partial metabolic 
response and 1 progressive metabolic disease, and the subject treated with 
placebo had a complete metabolic response. There were no CTCAE grade ≥3 
toxicities.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite low accrual, majority of subjects treated with metformin 
had metabolic responses by PERCIST criteria on PET imaging. Contrary to the 
effect of metformin on most physiologic tissues, most tumors had increased 
metabolic activity in response to metformin.
