AIMS: Among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) hypomagnesaemia has 
been reported in 14-48% of patients. This may be of significance given the 
emerging associations of hypomagnesaemia with glucometabolic disturbances and 
possibly even complications. We assessed the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia and 
its determinants, in a well-defined cohort of persons with T2DM treated in 
primary care.
METHODS: Observational cohort study among persons with T2DM treated in primary 
care in the Northeast of the Netherlands. Magnesium was measured using a 
colorimetric endpoint assay (Roche). Hypomagnesaemia was defined as a serum 
magnesium level <0.70 mmol/L. Pearson correlations were performed to correlate 
variables with serum magnesium. Next, a stepwise backward regression model was 
made.
RESULTS: Data of 929 persons (55% male) with a mean age of 65 (± 10) years, 
diabetes duration 6.5 [3.0-10.1] years, and HbA1c concentration 6.7 (± 0.7)% (50 
(± 9) mmol/mol) were analysed. Serum magnesium was 0.79 (± 0.08) mmol/L. The 
percentage of persons with magnesium deficiency was 9.6%. Age, diabetes 
duration, BMI, HbA1c, use of metformin, sulfonylurea derivatives, and DPP4 
inhibitors were negatively associated with magnesium concentrations. In 
contrast, LDL cholesterol and serum creatinine were positively associated serum 
magnesium.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypomagnesaemia was present in 9.6% of T2DM patients treated in 
primary care. This percentage is remarkably lower than reported previously, 
possibly due to the unselected nature of our population. Concerning T2DM-related 
factors, only BMI, HbA1c and the use of metformin, sulfonylurea derivatives and 
DPP4 inhibitors correlated negatively with magnesium concentrations.
