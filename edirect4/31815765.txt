Gallbladder cancer is the most common biliary tract cancer with poor prognosis 
and wide variation in incidence rates worldwide, being very high in some 
countries in Latin America and Asia. Treatment of type 2 diabetes with metformin 
causes a reduction in the incidence of cancer. Till date, there are no reports 
on the anti-tumor effects of metformin in gall bladder cancer. Therefore, this 
study evaluated the effects of metformin on the proliferation of human 
gallbladder adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo, as well as explored the 
microRNAs associated with the anti-tumor effects of metformin. Metformin 
inhibited the proliferation in gallbladder adenocarcinoma cell lines NOZ, 
TGBC14TKB, and TGBC24TKB, and blocked the G0 to G1 transition in the cell cycle. 
This was accompanied by strong reduction in the expression of G1 cyclins, 
especially cyclin D1 and its catalytic subunits including cyclin-dependent 
kinase 4, and in retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. In addition, metformin 
reduced the phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases, especially Tie-2, ALK, 
PYK, EphA4, and EphA10, as well as angiogenesis-related proteins, including 
RANTES, TGF-Î², and TIMP-1. Moreover, metformin also markedly altered microRNA 
expression profile leading to an anti-tumor effect. Treatment of athymic nude 
mice bearing xenograft tumors with metformin inhibited tumor growth. These 
results suggest that metformin may be used clinically for the treatment of 
gallbladder adenocarcinoma.
