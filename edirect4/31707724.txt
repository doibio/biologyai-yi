Obesity and diabetes increase hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) risk, 
thus preventive interventions are heavily studied. How pregestational 
prediabetes and related interventions impact HDP risk is less characterized. 
Therefore, we searched and reviewed the literature to assess the impact on HDP 
risk of prediabetes and varied interventions. We identified 297 citations 
related to pregnancy, prediabetes, and early pregnancy interventions. We also 
reviewed the references and citations of included articles. We included five 
studies assessing HDP outcomes in women with first trimester hemoglobin A1c in 
the prediabetes range (5.7-6.4%). One prospective observational study 
demonstrated first trimester hemoglobin A1c (5.9-6.4%) is associated with 
increased HDP risk, while another prospective observational study and one 
retrospective observational study had similar trends without statistical 
significance. A small and underpowered randomized controlled trial demonstrated 
initiating gestational diabetes mellitus treatment (i.e., diet, 
monitoring, ± insulin) in response to first trimester hemoglobin A1c (5.7-6.4%) 
did not statistically reduce HDP compared with standard care. One retrospective 
observational study suggested metformin, when started early, may reduce HDP risk 
in patients with prediabetes. Pregestational prediabetes appears to increase HDP 
risk. Interventions (i.e., metformin, diet/glucose monitoring, and/or exercise) 
to reduce HDP risk require additional study with long-term follow-up.
