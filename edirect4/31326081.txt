BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Elderly patients with type 2 diabetes represent a 
growing and heterogeneous group of subjects where treatment targets and 
antihyperglycemic drugs prescriptions should be tailored according to coexisting 
illnesses, functional and social domains.
METHODS: We carried-out a national cross-sectional study (from February 2014 to 
December 2014) to assess prescription patterns and treatment inadequacy in 
patients with type 2 diabetes older than 65 years with at least 6 months of 
treatment with antihyperglycemic drugs.
RESULTS: We included a total of 4,917 patients cared by 2,100 family physicians 
and 450 specialists. Diabetes prescriptions were monotherapy (21.2%), dual 
therapy (58.1%) and triple therapy (20.6%). The most common prescription 
patterns were metformin in monotherapy (66.5%), metformin plus DPP4 inhibitors 
in dual therapy (77.3%) and, in triple therapy, oral drugs (45.5%) and oral 
drugs plus insulin (45.8%). A total of 1,272 (25.9%) patients were at risk of 
serious hypoglycemia, 643 of them due to treatment with secretagogues (25%) or 
treatment with human insulin types (25.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with type 2 diabetes often receive 
antihyperglycemic therapy with higher risk of hypoglycemia. Substitution of 
secretagogues and human insulin therapy for safer medication could significantly 
reduce the adverse effects of diabetes treatment in this population.
