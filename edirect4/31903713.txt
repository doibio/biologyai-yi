We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using a database from commercial health 
plans in the United States to describe trends in the use of antidiabetic 
medications among patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure (HF) from 2006 
through 2017. We used loop diuretic dose as a surrogate for HF severity (mild HF 
0-40 mg/day, moderate-severe HF >40 mg/day). We assessed antidiabetic medication 
dispensing in the 90 days following HF diagnosis. Over the 12-year period, we 
identified an increase in the use of metformin (39.2% vs. 62.6%), dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) (0.5% vs. 17.1%) and sodium-glucose 
co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) (0.0% vs. 9.0%), but a decrease in the use 
of sulphonylureas (47.8% vs. 27.8%) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) (31.7% vs. 
5.3%). In 2017, patients with moderate-severe HF more commonly used insulin 
(43.1%); a majority of mild HF patients used metformin (62.8%). A proportion of 
patients with moderate-severe HF used TZDs (4.4%). Among patients with diabetes 
and HF, the use of metformin and DPP-4i rapidly increased, but a proportion of 
patients with moderate-severe HF continued to use TZDs. Despite their promising 
cardiovascular safety profile, SGLT-2i use remains limited.
