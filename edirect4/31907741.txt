OBJECTIVES: Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) may occur after acute 
metformin overdose, or from therapeutic use in patients with renal compromise. 
The mortality is high, historically 50% and more recently 25%. In many disease 
states, lactate concentration is strongly associated with mortality. The aim of 
this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the utility of pH and 
lactate concentration in predicting mortality in patients with MALA.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from their inception to 
April 2019 for case reports, case series, prospective, and retrospective studies 
investigating mortality in patients with MALA. Cases and studies were reviewed 
by all authors and included if they reported data on pH, lactate, and outcome. 
Where necessary, authors of studies were contacted for patient-level data. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for pH and lactate 
for predicting mortality in patients with MALA.
RESULTS: Forty-four studies were included encompassing 170 cases of MALA with 
median age of 68.5 years old. Median pH and lactate were 7.02 mmol/L and 
14.45 mmol/L, respectively. Overall mortality was 36.2% (95% CI 29.6-43.94). 
Neither lactate nor pH was a good predictor of mortality among patients with 
MALA. The area under the ROC curve for lactate and pH were 0.59 (0.51-0.68) and 
0.43 (0.34-0.52), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our review found higher mortality from MALA than seen in recent 
studies. This may be due to variation in standard medical practice both 
geographically and across the study interval, sample size, misidentification of 
MALA for another disease process and vice versa, confounding by selection and 
reporting biases, and treatment intensity (e.g., hemodialysis) influenced by 
degree of pH and lactate derangement. The ROC curves showed poor predictive 
power of either lactate or pH for mortality in MALA. With the exception of 
patients with acute metformin overdose, patients with MALA usually have 
coexisting precipitating illnesses such as sepsis or renal failure, though 
lactate from MALA is generally higher than would be considered survivable for 
those disease states on their own. It is possible that mortality is more related 
to that coexisting illness than MALA itself, and many patients die with MALA 
rather than from MALA. Additional work looking solely at MALA in healthy 
patients with acute metformin overdose may show a closer relationship between 
lactate, pH, and mortality.
