Lactate, the main contributor to the acidic tumor microenvironment, not only 
promotes the proliferation of tumor cells, but also closely relates to tumor 
invasion and metastasis. Here, a tumor targeting nanoplatform, designated as 
Me&Flu@MSN@MnO2-FA, was fabricated for effective tumor suppression and 
anti-metastasis by interfering with lactate metabolism of tumor cells. Metformin 
(Me) and fluvastatin sodium (Flu) were incorporated into MnO2-coated mesoporous 
silicon nanoparticles (MSNs), the synergism between Me and Flu can modulate the 
pyruvate metabolic pathway to produce more lactate, and concurrently inhibit 
lactate efflux to induce intracellular acidosis to kill tumor cells. As a result 
of the restricted lactate efflux, the extracellular lactate concentration is 
reduced, and the ability of the tumor cells to migrate is also weakened. This 
ingenious strategy based on Me&Flu@MSN@MnO2-FA showed an obvious inhibitory 
effect on tumor growth and resistance to metastasis.
