Metformin is widely used as an oral hypoglycemic drug in the management of type 
2 diabetes mellitus. This study evaluated the possible protective effects of 
metformin against cisplatin-induced genotoxicity and apoptosis in rat bone 
marrow cells. Two different doses of metformin (50 and 100 mg/kg b.w.) were 
administered orally to experimental animals for seven consecutive days. On the 
seventh day, the rats were exposed to cisplatin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h after the 
last oral metformin administration. Rats in the control group were treated 
orally with 10 ml/kg PBS for 7 consecutive days and a single intraperitoneal 
injection of saline (0.9%) on the 7th day. The antagonistic effects of metformin 
against cisplatin were evaluated using micronucleus assay, reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) level analysis, hematological analysis, and flow cytometry. 
Treatment with 50 and 100 mg/kg metformin before cisplatin injection produced a 
significant reduction in the frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic 
erythrocytes (MnPCEs) and micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes (MnNCEs) 
24 h after cisplatin treatment with a corresponding increase in the 
PCE/(PCE + NCE) ratio. Moreover, metformin markedly elevated the levels of both 
red and white blood cells in peripheral blood and decreased the percentage of 
apoptotic cells and the ROS level in bone marrow cells of rats treated with 
cisplatin. The data suggest that metformin has potential chemoprotective 
properties in rat bone marrow after cisplatin treatment, which support its 
candidature as a potential chemoprotective agent for cancer patients undergoing 
chemotherapy.
