BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin 
condition that has a substantial impact on patients' quality of life. As the 
exact pathogenesis remains unclear, treatment is complex and not yet 
standardized.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe patient characteristics and to 
broadly examine trends in treatment response of various therapeutic strategies 
in patients with HS in a single academic referral center in the southern USA.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of a cohort of HS patients 
seen in a faculty general dermatology practice with academic affiliation to 
Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, TX, between February 2015 and 
February 2018. Patient demographics, clinical features, prescribed treatments, 
and response to treatment were analyzed using the Pearson χ2 test or Fisher 
exact test, and by the Mann-Whitney U test for categorical and continuous 
variables, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 149 patients (113 females, 36 males) were included. Hurley 
stages I, II, and III were diagnosed in 29.6, 36.5, and 33.9% of patients, 
respectively. 44.2% of patients had a positive family history of HS, 39.5% of 
patients were current or former smokers, and 52.8% reported alcohol use. 80.9% 
of patients were overweight or obese (BMI ≥25), compared to 68.5% in Texas in 
2016 (p = 0.0012). The most frequently prescribed treatments were oral 
antibiotic therapy (83.9%), topical antibiotic therapy (74.5%), metabolic 
medications such as metformin/zinc (67.1%), intralesional Kenalog (63.1%), and 
biologic therapies (tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors; TNF-α inhibitors; 49%). 
In examining the response rate, patients with disease localized to the buttocks 
had significantly higher response rates (60.4 vs. 25%, p = 0.043) and approached 
statistical significance in responders versus nonresponders in treatment with 
biologics (p = 0.0632) when compared against all other treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: HS is a complex inflammatory skin condition associated with obesity 
and smoking. In this cohort, the most frequently prescribed therapies were oral 
and topical antibiotics. However, the use of biologic agents (TNF-α inhibitors) 
appears to be associated with the most significant treatment response.
KEY POINTS: This is the first study to evaluate trends in treatment response of 
various therapeutic strategies in HS patients at an academic referral center in 
Dallas, TX, a unique geographic region of the southern USA. Biologic therapy 
(TNF-α inhibitor) appears to be associated with the most significant treatment 
response.
