BACKGROUND: The study investigated the risk of newly developed bipolar disorder 
(BD) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and examined the 
relationship between PCOS treatment (hormone therapy (clomiphene or cyproterone) 
or metformin) and risk of BD development.
METHODS: In all, 7175 PCOS patients and 28,697 non-PCOS controls matched by age, 
index year, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score were included between 
2000 and 2012, then followed until the end of 2013. Participants newly diagnosed 
as BD by board-certified psychiatrists were defined as incidents. Cox regression 
analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of the BD incidence rate between two studied groups.
RESULTS: PCOS patients had a significantly increased risk of developing BD 
compared to unaffected controls after adjusting for age, CCI score, and 
different treatment options (1.05 vs. 0.12 per 1,000 person-years, HR: 8.29, 95% 
CI: 4.65-14.7). Also, the use of metformin in PCOS patients showed a 
significantly reduced risk of developing BD compared to non-users after 
adjusting for the above-mentioned variables (HR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16-0.81). 
Although hormone therapy in PCOS patients showed a lower incidence rate of BD 
development compared to non-users, the risk estimate was not statistically 
significant (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.35-1.32).
LIMITATIONS: This study didn't assess the PCOS severity, which reduced the 
chances of showing the effects of PCOS severity on BD development.
CONCLUSION: This study shows PCOS patients have an increased risk of developing 
BD, and the use of metformin may reduce its risk.
