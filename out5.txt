However, recent studies have shown that it may also have potential benefits for neural health. The article indicates that ART can improve symptoms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a common complication of diabetes that affects nerve function. This suggests that ART may have broader applications in maintaining neurological health and potentially slowing down age-related cognitive decline.\\n\\n2. **Apoptosis Inhibition**: The study found that ART treatment reduced cell death (apoptosis) in Schwann cells, which are important for nerve function. By inhibiting apoptosis, ART may help preserve nerve integrity and prevent further damage, which is crucial for maintaining healthy nerves over time.\\n\\n3. **Promotion of Cell Survival**: Not only does ART inhibit apoptosis, but it also promotes the survival of Schwann cells. This means that ART not only prevents damage but may also support the growth and maintenance of these cells, which could contribute to better nerve regeneration and overall health.\\n\\n4. **PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway**: The abstract highlights the involvement of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis in the beneficial effects of ART. This signaling pathway is critical for cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Activation of this pathway by ART may explain how it enhances cellular health and protects against degenerative processes.\\n\\n5. **Potential Life Extension Implications**: While the study focuses on diabetic neuropathy, the findings suggest that ART could potentially have wider implications for life extension by preserving nerve health and function. Since nerve degeneration is a hallmark of aging, any intervention that can protect or enhance nervous system function could contribute to a longer and healthier life.\\n\\nIn summary, this research provides evidence that ART may be a promising therapeutic agent for preventing and treating DPN by modulating apoptosis and promoting cell survival through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. For someone interested in life extension, this suggests that understanding and potentially utilizing compounds like ART could be part of a comprehensive strategy to maintain neurological health and potentially slow down the aging process.<|im_end|>\""}

High levels of HCY have been linked to endothelial dysfunction, which can lead to various cardiovascular issues.\\n\\n2. **Endothelial Cell Senescence**: The article demonstrates that HCY can induce senescence in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), as evidenced by decreased cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and an increase in SA-β-Gal positive cells.\\n\\n3. **Autophagy and Senescence**: Autophagy, a cellular process involved in the recycling of damaged or unnecessary proteins and organelles, appears to play a role in HCY-induced senescence.

Epidemiologic studies in humans parallel these findings, indicating \\nfavorable effects of metformin on longevity and on reducing the incidence and \\nmorbidity associated with aging-related diseases. Despite this promise, the full \\nspectrum of molecular effectors responsible for these health benefits remains \\nelusive. Through unbiased screening in Caenorhabditis elegans, we uncovered a \\nrole for genes necessary for ether lipid biosynthesis in the favorable effects \\nof biguanides. We demonstrate that biguanides prompt lifespan extension by \\nstimulating ether lipid biogenesis. Loss of the ether lipid biosynthetic \\nmachinery also mitigates lifespan extension attributable to dietary restriction, \\ntarget of rapamycin (TOR) inhibition, and mitochondrial electron transport chain \\ninhibition. A possible mechanistic explanation for this finding is that ether \\nlipids are required for activation of longevity-promoting, metabolic stress \\ndefenses downstream of the conserved transcription factor skn-1/Nrf. In \\nalignment with these findings, overexpression of a single, key, ether lipid \\nbiosynthetic enzyme, fard-1/FAR1, is sufficient to promote lifespan extension. \\nThese findings illuminate the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery as a novel \\ntherapeutic target to promote healthy aging.\\n\\nPlain Language Summary: Metformin is the drug most prescribed to treat type 2 \\ndiabetes around the world and has been in clinical use since 1950. The drug \\nbelongs to a family of compounds known as biguanides which reduce blood sugar, \\nmaking them an effective treatment against type 2 diabetes. More recently, \\nbiguanides have been found to have other health benefits, including limiting the \\ngrowth of various cancer cells and improving the lifespan and long-term health \\nof several model organisms. Epidemiologic studies also suggest that metformin \\nmay increase the lifespan of humans and reduce the incidence of age-related \\nillnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and dementia. Given the safety \\nand effectiveness of metformin, understanding how it exerts these desirable \\neffects may allow scientists to discover new mechanisms to promote healthy \\naging. The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is an ideal organism for studying \\nthe lifespan-extending effects of metformin. It has an average lifespan of two \\nweeks, a genome that is relatively easy to manipulate, and a transparent body \\nthat enables scientists to observe cellular and molecular events in living \\nworms. To discover the genes that enable metformin’s lifespan-extending \\nproperties, Cedillo, Ahsan et al. systematically switched off the expression of \\nabout 1,000 genes involved in C. elegans metabolism. They then screened for \\ngenes which impaired the action of biguanides when inactivated. This ultimately \\nled to the identification of a set of genes involved in promoting a longer \\nlifespan. Cedillo, Ahsan et al. then evaluated how these genes impacted other \\nwell-described pathways involved in longevity and stress responses. The analysis \\nindicated that a biguanide drug called phenformin (which is similar to \\nmetformin) increases the synthesis of ether lipids, a class of fats that are \\ncritical components of cellular membranes. Indeed, genetically mutating the \\nthree major enzymes required for ether lipid production stopped the biguanide \\nfrom extending the worms’ lifespans. Critically, inactivating these genes also \\nprevented lifespan extension through other known strategies, such as dietary \\nrestriction and inhibiting the cellular organelle responsible for producing \\nenergy. Cedillo, Ahsan et al. also showed that increasing ether lipid production \\nalters the activity of a well-known longevity and stress response factor called \\nSKN-1, and this change alone is enough to extend the lifespan of worms. These \\nfindings suggest that promoting the production of ether lipids could lead to \\nhealthier aging. However, further studies, including clinical trials, will be \\nrequired to determine whether this is a viable approach to promote longevity and \\nhealth in humans.\\n\\n© 2023, Cedillo, Ahsan et al.\\n\\nDOI: 10.7554/eLife.82210\\nPMCID: PMC10444025\\nPMID: 37606250 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: LC, FA, SL, NS, YZ, YZ, AA, LM, AY, SE, KD, ZL, \\nNP, JW, MJ, SD, RP, SC, AS No competing interests declared\\n<|im_end|> \\n        <|im_start|> assistant\\n        Thank you for sharing this detailed scientific article summary. For someone who is well-educated about life extension methods and interested in the latest research, this summary provides valuable insights into the potential role of ether lipid biosynthesis in promoting lifespan extension and the interplay between biguanides like metformin and various pro-longevity paradigms.

Here's a summary of the findings presented:\\n\\n1. **Ginsenoside Rg1 (G-Rg1)**: The study suggests that G-Rg1, a compound derived from ginseng, has protective effects against various types of cellular stress, including those induced by alcohol consumption. This supports previous research indicating that ginseng and its constituents may have health benefits, particularly related to cardiovascular health.\\n\\n2. **Alcohol-Induced Myocardial Injury**: Ethanol exposure can lead to heart muscle damage, which the study indicates G-Rg1 can help mitigate. By doing so, it suggests that G-Rg1 may have potential in preventing or treating alcohol-related cardiotoxicity.\\n\\n3. **Autophagy Regulation**: Autophagy is a process by which cells break down and recycle damaged or unnecessary components. The study found that G-Rg1 can regulate autophagy, potentially helping to maintain cellular health and prevent dysfunction associated with aging.\\n\\n4. **Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress (ERS)**: ERS occurs when the endoplasmic reticulum (a cellular organelle involved in protein folding) becomes overwhelmed, leading to cellular stress. G-Rg1 appears to reduce ERS, which could be beneficial in maintaining overall cellular homeostasis and preventing damage that accumulates with age.\\n\\n5. **AMPK/mTOR Pathway**: The AMPK/mTOR pathway plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism, growth, and survival. The study shows that G-Rg1 can influence this pathway, suggesting that it may contribute to metabolic balance and possibly delay the onset of age-related diseases.\\n\\n6. **PERK/ATF4/CHOP Pathway**: The PERK/ATF4/CHOP pathway is another stress response pathway that G-Rg1 affects. Modulating this pathway could help protect against cell death and support cellular resilience.\\n\\nOverall, the study provides evidence that G-Rg1 may exert pleiotropic effects on cellular processes, including autophagy regulation, ERS reduction, and modulation of key signaling pathways. These effects could contribute to a healthier cellular environment and potentially slower the progression of age-\""}

The study focuses on lysosomal enzymes called cathepsins, which play a role in cellular degradation and are upregulated in stressed tissues. Specifically, the article investigates the role of cathepsin S (CTSS) in skeletal muscle mass loss and dysfunction due to chronic stress.\\n\\n**Methods:**\\nResearchers used two groups of mice - wildtype (CTSS+/+) and CTSS-knockout (CTSS-/-) - and subjected them to either non-stress or variable-stress conditions. They measured muscle mass, function, and fiber area, as well as markers of mitochondrial damage. Additionally, they studied the effects of pharmacological CTSS inhibition.\\n\\n**Results:**\\nStressed CTSS+/+ mice experienced significant muscle mass loss, dysfunction, and fiber area reductions, along with mitochondrial damage. These effects were associated with altered levels of proteins involved in insulin signaling, protein synthesis, and apoptosis. Conversely, CTSS-/- mice did not show these negative effects. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of CTSS had similar beneficial effects on muscle health as genetic CTSS deletion.\\n\\n**Implications for Life Extension:**\\nThis study suggests that targeting CTSS activity may be a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing or reversing muscle wasting and related health issues caused by chronic stress. By understanding how CTSS affects muscle protein balance and cell survival, researchers may be able to develop new treatments to protect against stress-induced muscle degeneration. This could potentially lead to interventions that help maintain muscle health and function, which is important for overall healthspan and quality of life.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\nThe study provides evidence that CTSS plays a role in the mechanisms underlying stress-induced muscle atrophy and dysfunction. Modulating CTSS activity might offer a novel approach to mitigate the detrimental effects of chronic stress on muscle health, which could have implications for developing life extension therapies aimed at preserving muscle mass and function.<|im_end|>\""}

Differences in the kinetics and \\nmolecular mechanisms by which rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 suggest that \\na therapeutic window for rapamycin could be exploited using intermittent dosing \\nschedules or alternative rapalogs that may enable more selective inhibition of \\nmTORC1. However, the optimal dosing schedules and the long-term efficacy of such \\ninterventions in humans are unknown. Here, we highlight ongoing or upcoming \\nclinical trials that will address outstanding questions regarding the safety, \\npharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of rapamycin and rapalogs on \\nseveral clinically oriented outcomes.

It highlights recent research suggesting that rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs) may offer therapeutic benefits by selectively inhibiting mTORC1, while avoiding the unwanted side effects associated with broader mTORC2 inhibition.\\n\\n        The authors point out that intermittent dosing schedules or the use of alternative rapalogs with greater specificity for mTORC1 might minimize off-target effects and open up a therapeutic window for the safe use of these compounds in humans. They emphasize the importance of ongoing and future clinical trials to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and effectiveness of rapamycin and rapalogs on a range of clinical outcomes.\\n\\n        For someone well-educated about life extension methods, this article would likely serve as an informative update on the current state of research into rapamycin and its potential role in human healthspan extension.

During the trial, we noted body weight loss in some \\npatients, particularly in women. We hypothesized that everolimus causes body \\nweight reduction by reduced food intake and/or metabolic changes, which could \\nlead to cachexia.\\nMETHODS: Within a sub-analysis of the CRAD001ADE12 trial, body weight course was \\ninvestigated regarding sex-specific differences in 433 adult ADPKD patients \\n(everolimus, n = 215; placebo, n = 218). One hundred four out of 111 patients \\nwho participated in the clinical trial centre in Berlin were evaluated under \\neverolimus/placebo therapy (on drug: everolimus, n = 48; placebo, n = 56) and \\nafter therapy (off drug: everolimus, n = 15; placebo, n = 18). Eating habits and \\nnutrient/caloric intake were evaluated by validated questionnaires. Systemic and \\nlocal metabolism was evaluated in four patients after an oral glucose load (OGL) \\nby using calorimetry and adipose/muscle tissue microdialysis.\\nRESULTS: Within the 2-year CRAD001ADE12 trial, a significant body weight loss \\nwas observed in female patients on everolimus versus placebo (P = 0.0029). Data \\nof the Berlin Cohort revealed that weight loss was greater in women on \\neverolimus versus men (P < 0.01). After 9 months, women and men had lost \\n2.6 ± 3.8 and 0.8 ± 1.5 kg (P < 0.05) in body weight, respectively, and after \\n21 months, they had lost 4.1 ± 6.6 and 1.0 ± 3.3 kg (P < 0.05), respectively. On \\neverolimus, caloric intake was significantly lower in women versus men \\n(1510 ± 128 vs. 2264 ± 216 kcal/day, P < 0.05), caused mainly by a lower fat and \\nprotein intake in women versus men. Cognitive restraints, disinhibition and \\nhunger remained unchanged. In a subgroup of patients resting metabolic rate was \\nunchanged whereas OGL-induced thermogenesis was reduced (7 ± 2 vs. 11 ± 2 kcal, \\nP < 0.05). Fasting and OGL-induced fat oxidation was increased (P < 0.05) on \\nversus off everolimus. In adipose tissue, fasting lipolytic activity was \\nincreased, but lipolytic activity was inhibited similarly after the OGL on \\nversus off everolimus, respectively. In skeletal muscle, postprandial glucose \\nuptake and aerobic glycolysis was reduced in patients on everolimus.\\nCONCLUSIONS: mTOR inhibition by everolimus induces body weight reduction, \\nspecifically in female patients. This effect is possibly caused by a centrally \\nmediated reduced food (fat and protein) intake and by centrally/peripherally \\nmediated increased fat oxidation (systemic) and mobilization (adipose tissue). \\nGlucose uptake and oxidation might be reduced in skeletal muscle.

The study found that women on everolimus experienced a greater decrease in body weight compared to men, potentially due to a lower intake of calories, fat, and protein. The mechanism behind this weight loss appears to involve both central and peripheral effects, including reduced food consumption and increased fat oxidation. Additionally, the study found evidence of altered glucose metabolism, with reduced glucose uptake and oxidation in skeletal muscle. These findings have implications for understanding the potential side effects of mTOR inhibitors, such as everolimus, on body weight and metabolism, particularly in long-term treatment scenarios.<|im_end|>\""}

Since transcription factor \\nEB (TFEB) is a master regulator of ALP, TFEB-mediated ALP activation might have \\na therapeutic effect on DE, but this has yet to be investigated.\\nMETHODS: We established T2DM mouse models and cultured HT22 cells under \\nhigh-glucose (HG) conditions to confirm the role of ALP in DE. To further \\ninvestigate this, both mice and HT22 cells were treated with 3-methyladenine \\n(3-MA). We also analyzed the content of TFEB in the nucleus and cytoplasm to \\nevaluate its role in ALP. To confirm the effect of TFEB activation at the \\npost-translational level in DE, we used rapamycin to inhibit the mechanistic \\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR). We transduced both mice and cells with TFEB \\nvector to evaluate the therapeutic effect of TFEB overexpression on DE. \\nConversely, we conducted TFEB knockdown to verify its role in DE in another \\ndirection.\\nRESULTS: We found that T2DM mice experienced compromised cognitive function, \\nwhile HG-cultured HT22 cells exhibited increased cell apoptosis. Additionally, \\nboth T2DM mice and HG-cultured HT22 cells showed impaired ALP and heavier \\nAD-like pathology. This pathology worsened after treatment with 3-MA. We also \\nobserved decreased TFEB nuclear translocation in both T2DM mice and HG-cultured \\nHT22 cells. However, inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin or overexpressing TFEB \\nincreased TFEB nuclear translocation, enhancing the clearance of ALP-targeted \\nAD-like pathology. This contributed to protection against neuronal apoptosis and \\nalleviation of cognitive impairment. Conversely, TFEB knockdown lessened \\nALP-targeted AD-like pathology clearance and had a negative impact on DE.\\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that impaired ALP is responsible for the \\naggravation of AD-like pathology in T2DM.

Here's a breakdown of the key points from the study:\\n\\n1. **Link Between Diabetes and Alzheimer's**: The study suggests that DE, a complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is characterized by AD-like pathology. This includes cognitive decline and an accumulation of misfolded proteins, similar to what is observed in AD patients.\\n\\n2. **Role of Autophagy**: The ALP plays a critical role in degrading these misfolded proteins. When this pathway is impaired, it leads to the aggravation of AD-like pathology in T2DM patients.\\n\\n3. **Transcription Factor EB (TFEB)**: TFEB is a key regulator of the ALP. The study found that TFEB activity is reduced in both T2DM mouse models and cells exposed to high glucose levels, indicating that TFEB may play a role in the pathogenesis of DE.\\n\\n4. **mTOR Signaling**: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism. The study shows that inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin can activate TFEB, leading to improved ALP function and reduced AD-like pathology.\\n\\n5. **TFEB Overexpression**: Transducing cells with TFEB vectors increases TFEB expression, which enhances the clearance of ALP-targeted AD-like pathology, reduces neuronal apoptosis, and improves cognitive function in T2DM mouse models.\\n\\n6. **Potential Therapeutic Target**: The study proposes that activating TFEB through mTOR inhibition or directly overexpressing TFEB could be effective therapies for DE, potentially slowing down or reversing the progression of AD-like pathology in T2DM patients.\\n\\nIn summary, the study highlights the importance of ALP dysfunction in the development of DE and AD-like pathology in T2DM.

The study suggests that DJ-1 acts as an RNA-binding protein that binds to the mRNA of key components of L-VGCCs (alpha and auxiliary Ca2+ channel subunits CaV1.2 and α2δ2), which leads to reduced translation of these proteins in dendrites. This mechanism appears to be specific to disease states characterized by mTORC1 overactivation.\\n\\nThe implications of this research include identifying a novel molecular pathway that may contribute to the pathophysiology of TSC and AD, as well as potentially other neurological conditions.

Organoids are three-dimensional cultures derived from stem cells or tissues that can recapitulate the structure and function of organs. By creating NICH organoids, researchers can better understand the biology of this rare vascular tumor and develop more targeted treatment strategies.\\n\\nThe study describes the successful construction and optimization of NICH organoids, which exhibit characteristics similar to those seen in NICH tissue. This includes the expression of specific proteins and genes as evidenced by immunohistological staining and transcriptome analysis. The authors also report that the organoids have high proliferative capacity and can give rise to new cells that retain the characteristics of NICH.\\n\\nDrug validation experiments with trametinib, sirolimus, and propranolol revealed that these agents did not inhibit the growth of NICH organoids. This suggests that alternative drugs may need to be explored for the treatment of NICH.\\n\\nOverall, this research provides a valuable tool for investigating the mechanisms underlying NICH and could lead to improved therapies for patients suffering from this condition. Additionally, the development of NICH organoids opens up new avenues for personalized medicine and drug discovery, as it allows for the testing of potential treatments directly on patient-specific tumor models.<|im_end|>\""}

These pathways play key roles in regulating cellular growth, proliferation, and survival. The study focuses on canagliflozin, a drug that has been shown to extend lifespan in male mice, and how it affects these signaling cascades. The research suggests that canagliflozin works by reducing activity in the mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) and ERK1-2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2) pathways, which are also targeted by other known longevity-promoting treatments like rapamycin, acarbose, and estrogen. The findings highlight the potential of canagliflozin as a pharmacological intervention for extending lifespan and provide insights into the shared mechanisms behind various anti-aging strategies. Additionally, the study reveals differences in these pathways between male and female mice, which may explain why some treatments affect one sex more than the other.<|im_end|>\""}

Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), \\nalleviated premature cellular senescence, rescued the decrease in insulin \\nsignaling, and extended the lifespan of WS model of C. elegans. To the best of \\nour knowledge, this study is the first to reveal the critical role of cellular \\nsenescence in subcutaneous lipoatrophy and severe insulin resistance in WS, \\nhighlighting the therapeutic potential of rapamycin for this disease.\\n\\nDOI: 10.18632/aging.205078\\nPMCID: PMC10599740\\nPMID: 37793000 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: The authors declare no \\nconflicts of interest.\\n<|im_end|> \\n        <|im_start|> assistant\\n        This article published in \\\"Aging\\\" provides insights into the mechanisms behind Werner syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that leads to premature aging, including metabolic abnormalities such as visceral fat accumulation and subcutaneous lipoatrophy. The research suggests that cellular senescence and the associated inflammatory response contribute to these changes, leading to insulin resistance. The study also demonstrates that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, can alleviate cellular senescence and improve insulin signaling in vitro and extend the lifespan of a WS model organism, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for Werner syndrome.<|im_end|>\""}
