BACKGROUND: Major antihypertensive drug classes (but not Imidazoline Receptor 
Agonists) have been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality. In 2017, Latvia and Lithuania had the highest cardiovascular 
mortality among the Eastern, Central, Northern, and Western Member States of the 
European Union (EU). Cardiovascular mortality in Estonia is much lower than in 
Lithuania and Latvia.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the consumption of Imidazoline Receptor Agonists in the 
Baltic States and its potential implications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included data on the sales of Imidazoline 
Receptor Agonists in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia; the marketing authorization 
databases of the competent authorities; the guidelines on the treatment of 
hypertension, and the reimbursement conditions.
RESULTS: The study showed a very high consumption of the Imidazoline Receptor 
Agonists in Lithuania and Latvia. From 2016 to 2019, the average consumption of 
Imidazoline Receptor Agonists in Lithuania was 15.5 times higher than in 
Estonia; in Latvia, it was 8.9 times higher than in Estonia. The guidelines 
recommend the use of the Imidazoline Receptors Agonists as one of the last 
options in hypertension therapy, but the marketing authorizations do not 
restrict their line of therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of IRAs in Lithuania and Latvia is very high. The 
authorized use of the IRAs in the EU Member States is not in line with the 
guidelines on the management of arterial hypertension and therefore patients 
might be deprived of therapies that reduce the cardiovascular risk. The drug 
regulatory authorities of the EU should review the data on the safety and 
efficacy of the IRAs and restrict their therapeutic indications if necessary.
