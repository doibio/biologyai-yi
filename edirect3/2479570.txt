The muscarinic agonist McN-A-343 did not affect the tone or 
nitroprusside-induced relaxations of the rat anococcygeus, but inhibited 
non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) relaxations. Atropine, pirenzepine and 
gallamine blocked the McN-A-343 inhibition of NANC relaxations. Agonists of 
alpha 1-(methoxamine) or alpha 2-adrenoceptors (clonidine, rilmenidine) 
increased tone and reduced NANC relaxations. Carbachol also increased tone but 
produced a greater reduction of NANC relaxations. The findings suggest that 
activation of prejunctional muscarinic receptors on NANC terminals inhibits 
transmitter release, but there is no evidence for prejunctional 
alpha-adrenoceptors.
