The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of rilmenidine (1-2 
mg/day) and atenolol (50-100 mg/day) on tests of mental arithmetic, bicycle 
exercise, and autonomic function. Twelve male patients with mild-to-moderate 
hypertension (blood pressure, 160/95 +/- 15/7 mm Hg; age range, 32 to 60 years) 
completed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Both drugs were well 
tolerated and, after 4 weeks of monotherapy, were associated with significant 
reductions in supine and erect BP. Hemodynamic responses to mental arithmetic 
were similar for both drugs, and neither agent affected mental performance as 
judged by psychomotor testing. The increase in heart rate during bicycle 
exercise was significantly greater with rilmenidine (50 vs. 41 beats/min, p = 
0.04), and during the postexercise recovery phase, areas under the curve for 
diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were smaller after atenolol than after 
rilmenidine: 46,450 versus 51,400 mm Hg.s (p = 0.02) and 49,445 versus 63,597 
beats/min.s (p = 0.001), respectively. In conclusion, rilmenidine and atenolol 
exert comparable antihypertensive effects both at rest and during mental and 
dynamic exercise. Although atenolol blunted the heart rate responses to dynamic 
exercise and the Valsalva maneuver, rilmenidine showed no interference with 
physiological hemodynamic responses of blood pressure and heart rate during 
tests of sympathetic and parasympathetic function.
