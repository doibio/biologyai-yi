receptors be a therapeutic target?

A sympathetic overactivity plays a major role in the pathogenesis of 
cardiovascular diseases in Westernized affluent societies. Of importance is an 
increased caloric intake and psychosocial stress which are associated with a 
raised central sympathetic outflow and unfavourable changes in metabolic 
parameters. Normalization of central sympathetic outflow could thus be a major 
therapeutic target. The newly developed antihypertensive drugs moxonidine and 
rilmenidine reduce the excitatory activity of neurons of the rostral 
ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) via binding to imidazoline receptors. Using radio 
telemetry, it is shown that, in contrast to the first generation centrally 
acting drug clonidine, moxonidine did not result in rebound of blood pressure 
after drug withdrawal in rats with spontaneous hypertension. In accordance, 
moxonidine is characterized by a low affinity for alpha-adrenoceptors and 
exhibits few side-effects. It is proposed that normalization of central 
sympathetic outflow represents a causal approach for improving crucial features 
of the metabolic syndrome.
