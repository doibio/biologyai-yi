1. In anaesthetized, fluid expanded rats rilmenidine has diuretic and 
natriuretic effects. There is strong evidence that the natriuresis is mediated 
by putative imidazoline receptors. In contrast, in conscious euvolaemic dogs 
rilmenidine has a diuretic effect that is entirely attributable to activation of 
alpha 2-adrenoceptors, but no natriuretic effect. To determine whether the 
effects of rilmenidine are truly species dependent, or merely dependent upon the 
influences of anaesthesia and volume status, we tested the effects of 
rilmenidine in pentobarbitone anaesthetized, volume-loaded dogs. 2. The effects 
of rilmenidine in anaesthetized, volume-loaded dogs were similar to those found 
in conscious euvolaemic dogs. Compared with vehicle treatment, levels of 
glomerular filtration rate, urine flow and haematocrit were increased following 
rilmenidine treatment. No effect of rilmenidine on sodium excretion was 
observed. 3. We conclude that the renal responses to rilmenidine in dogs are 
largely unaffected by anaesthesia and plasma volume status. In particular, the 
natriuretic effect seen in rats was not observed. We conclude that putative 
imidazoline receptors do not have a major influence on sodium excretion in dogs.
