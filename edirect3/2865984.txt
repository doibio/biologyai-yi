Gas chromatographic negative ion mass spectrometric assay of 
2-dicyclopropylmethylamino-2-oxazoline (S-3341), a new antihypertensive drug.

Ehrhardt JD.

The quantification in plasma and urine of 2-dicyclopropylmethylamino-2-oxazoline 
(S-3341), a new antihypertensive drug is described using a sensitive gas 
chromatographic negative ion mass spectrometric method with ammonia as 
moderating gas. After a two-step extraction, derivatization is carried out with 
3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl chloride and the abundance of the molecular ion 
(m/z 420) obtained is compared with that of the tetradeuterated standard (m/z 
424). The low background due to the high mass and negative ion detection 
provides a detection limit of about 1 pg per injection. Oral administration of 1 
or 2 mg S-3341 to patients gives a maximum concentration of 3.3 +/- 0.7 ng ml-1 
and 7.6 +/- 2.0 ng ml-1 at 1.8 +/- 0.6 h and 1.4 +/- 0.7 h and an average 
elimination half-life of 6.7 h.
