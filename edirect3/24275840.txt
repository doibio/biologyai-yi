OBJECTIVE: BPH/2J hypertensive mice have an exaggerated sympathetic contribution 
to blood pressure (BP). Premotor sympathetic neurons within the 
rostroventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are a major source of sympathetic vasomotor 
tone and major site of action of the centrally acting sympatholytic agent, 
rilmenidine. The relative cardiovascular effect of rilmenidine in BPH/2J versus 
normotensive BPN/3J mice was used as an indicator of the involvement of the RVLM 
in the sympathetic contribution to hypertension in BPH/2J mice.
METHODS: BPH/2J and BPN/3J mice were pre-implanted with telemetry devices to 
measure BP in conscious unrestrained mice. Rilmenidine was administered acutely 
(n=7-9/group), orally for 14 days, at a wide range of doses (n=5/group), and 
also infused intracerebroventricularly for 7 days (n=6/group).
RESULTS: Acute intraperitoneal rilmenidine induced greater depressor and 
bradycardic responses in BPH/2J than BPN/3J mice (Pstrain<0.01). Both responses 
were reduced by atropine pre-treatment, with the remaining hypotensive effect 
being small and comparable between strains (Pstrain=1.0). This suggests that 
vagally induced reductions in cardiac output were responsible for the 
hypotension. Chronic intracerebroventricularly infused rilmenidine reduced BP 
from baseline marginally in BPH/2J mice during the dark (active) period (-6.5 Â± 
2 mmHg; P=0.006). Chronic orally administered rilmenidine (1-12 mg/kg per day) 
also had minimal effect on 24-h BP in both strains (P>0.16).
CONCLUSION: The sympathetic vasomotor inhibitory effect of rilmenidine is 
minimal in both strains and similar in hypertensive BPH/2J and BPN/3J mice. 
Thus, hypertension in BPH/2J mice is not likely mediated by greater neuronal 
activity in the RVLM, and agents such as rilmenidine would be an ineffective 
treatment for this form of neurogenic hypertension.
