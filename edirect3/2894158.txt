Rilmenidine is a novel alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, used in the treatment of 
mild or moderate hypertension at the oral dose of 1 mg once or twice daily. The 
pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated after single or repeated 
administration in healthy subjects, using labeled and unlabeled compounds. 
Rilmenidine was rapidly and extensively absorbed, with an absolute 
bioavailability factor close to 1 and a maximal plasma concentration achieved 
within 2 hours. Rilmenidine was not subject to presystemic metabolism. 
Distribution was independent of the free fraction because rilmenidine was weakly 
bound to plasma proteins (less than 10%). The volume of distribution was 
approximately 5 l.kg-1 (315 liters). Elimination was rapid with a total body 
plasma clearance of approximately 450 ml.min-1 and an elimination half-life of 
approximately 8 hours. Renal excretion was the major elimination process 
(two-thirds of the total clearance). Metabolism was very poor, with a renal 
elimination of rilmenidine as the parent drug (urinary fraction of rilmenidine 
was about 65% and no metabolite plasma levels were detected). Linear 
pharmacokinetics were demonstrated for rilmenidine from 0.5 to 2 mg but, at 3 
mg, a slight deviation from linearity was observed. In repeated administration, 
the linear disposition of rilmenidine with dose was confirmed.
