The efficacy of antihypertensive agents was compared when given at different 
time points in the circadian rhythm. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were 
kept on a 12/12-h cycle with lights on/off at 07:00/19:00 h. A computerized 
system was used to measure intraarterial blood pressure and heart rate 
continuously. Agents or vehicle were intravenously injected at two time points. 
One at the beginning of the sleeping period, at which low efficacy was expected 
(T = 10), and one at T = 16, which is 3 h before the circadian peaks in blood 
pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), aimed at reducing the rise in BP and HR at 
awakening. The hypotensive effect of propranolol, metoprolol, labetalol, 
prazosin, clonidine, and rilmenidine was greater when injected at T = 16 than at 
T = 10 (p < 0.05 for propranolol, metoprolol, and rilmenidine). In contrast, the 
renal vasodilators captopril and tertatolol were more potent after injection at 
T = 10. Felodipine was equally effective at both time points. Thus, the effects 
of antihypertensive agents are related to the phase of the circadian rhythm. The 
data on the sympatholytic agents in general and beta-blockers and centrally 
acting agents in particular support antihypertensive regimens with timed 
administrations.
