The effects of rilmenidine, a new centrally acting antihypertensive agent, on a 
number of tests of autonomic function were investigated in six healthy male 
volunteers. Baroreflex function (delta RR interval [in milliseconds] with each 
millimeter of mercury change in systolic blood pressure) was determined in 
response to changes in pressure after injections of phenylephrine and 
nitroglycerin. Reflex cardiovascular responses to handgrip and standing, as well 
as during deep breathing and the Valsalva maneuver, were also investigated. 
Rilmenidine produced a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure that was not 
accompanied by an increase in heart rate. Under conditions of low basal 
sympathetic activity, rilmenidine enhanced parasympathetic tone during the early 
reflex heart rate changes that occur immediately after standing and during deep 
breathing, as well as baroreflex heart rate responses to phenylephrine. During a 
test of sympathetic function, standing blood pressure, and heart rate after 3 
minutes, rilmenidine reduced sympathetic tone.
