OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the possible role of MK-801, 
an NMDA antagonist, in analgesia induced by rilmenidine, an imidazoline (I(1)) 
agonist, in mice in the formalin test.
METHODS: 25 microl of formalin 2.5% was injected into the dorsal surface of the 
right hind paw of the mouse. Pain response was scored after formalin injection 
for a period of 50 min. A weighted average of nociceptive score, ranging from 0 
to 3, was calculated. The mean +/-SEM of scores between 0-5 and 15-40 min after 
formalin injection was presented.
RESULTS: The study showed that rilmenidine (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) 
produced analgesia dose-dependently (p<0.001) in formalin test. In addition, the 
results demonstrated that efaroxan (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) could reduce the 
antinociceptive effect of rilmenidine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) (p<0.01) in animals, 
however, yohimbine (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) could not block the analgesia 
induced by rilmenidine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) (p>0.05). On the other hand, MK-801 
(0.05 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the pain related behaviors in mice (p>0.05). 
Moreover, our findings demonstrated that MK-801 (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.) could 
potentiate the analgesic effect of rilmenidine (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly 
(p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that imidazoline (I(1)) receptors play 
an important role in mediating the antinociception induced by rilmenidine in 
formalin test. Furthermore, it may be concluded that there is an interaction 
between NMDA receptors and imidazoline (I(1)) binding sites.
