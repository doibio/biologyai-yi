The blood pressure is maintained by the tonic vasomotor activity of efferent 
sympathetic neurons which are tonically regulated by the rostral ventrolateral 
medulla (RVLM) in the brain. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist such as clonidine, 
guanabenz and guanfacine, acts on RVLM to decrease sympathetic neuron activity 
and lower blood pressure. Drug such as alpha-methyldopa, through its metabolite 
alpha-methylnoradrenaline, acts like clonidine as an alpha 2-adrenoceptor 
agonist in the brain. Clonidine and allied drugs except for alpha-methyldopa 
also bind to imidazoline receptors, which is believed to mediate the hypotensive 
action. The centrally acting antihypertensive drugs are used for treatment of 
moderate to severe forms of hypertension and are effective in patients with 
renal failure. The treatment with these drugs induces central nervous system 
side effect of sedation and drowsiness, which limits the clinical usefulness and 
are believed to be mediated by central alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The new 
imidazoline compounds, rilmenidine and moxonidine, which selectively act on 
imidazoline receptors, may be a useful antihypertensive drug without such 
central side effects.
