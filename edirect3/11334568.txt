Synthesis and biological evaluation of pyrrolinic isosteres of rilmenidine. 
Discovery of 
cis-/trans-dicyclopropylmethyl-(4,5-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)-amine 
(LNP 509), an I1 imidazoline receptor selective ligand with hypotensive 
activity.

To find new compounds selective for purported I1 imidazoline receptors (I1Rs) 
over I2 imidazoline binding sites (I2BS) and alpha2-adrenoceptors (alpha2ARs), a 
series of pyrrolinic isosteres of rilmenidine has been prepared and their 
biological activity at I1Rs, I2BS, and alpha2ARs evaluated. This isosteric 
replacement provided us with compounds which still bound to I1Rs but not to I2BS 
nor to alpha2ARs. A limited structure-affinity relationship was generated around 
the heterocyclic moiety of these ligands. One compound in this series, LNP 509 
(1e) 
[cis-/trans-dicyclopropylmethyl-(4,5-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)-amine], 
had no detectable affinity at alpha2ARs yet was capable of lowering blood 
pressure after central administration. These pyrrolinic analogues constitute a 
new chemical class of imidazoline related compounds with high selectivity for 
the I1Rs. They could be used as new tools in the study of I1Rs and in the 
conception of new centrally acting hypotensive drugs.
