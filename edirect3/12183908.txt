Conformational analysis of five I1-receptor agonists in the neutral form 
(clonidine, moxonidine, rilmenidine, phentolamine, and phencyclidine) and one 
antagonist of I1-receptors (idazoxane) was carried out by means of the MM2 
method. Structures of stable conformations of individual compounds were fully 
optimised. Degree of similarity of stable conformations was visualized. The 
proton affinities and lipophilicities of title compounds were also computed. It 
is obvious that all studied drugs except phencyclidine are able to occupy the 
same space. An important role for affinity of studied drugs towards I1-receptors 
can be played by their different hydrophobicity (logP = 1 az 2).
