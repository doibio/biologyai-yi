PURPOSE: To examine ocular actions by rilmenidine, an imidazoline1 and alpha 2 
adrenoceptor agonist.
METHODS: Intraocular pressure was measured in normal and sympathetically 
denervated rabbits by pneumatonometry. Electrically stimulated 3H-norepinephrine 
release from sympathetic nerves was determined in isolated, perfused rabbit 
iris-ciliary bodies. cAMP levels were evaluated in rabbit iris-ciliary bodies by 
radioimmunoassay. Ca2+ concentrations were measured in rabbit transformed 
nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells by fluorescence ratio microscopy.
RESULTS: Topical, unilateral administration of rilmenidine produced hypotensive 
responses in normal rabbits which were antagonized by either bilaterally 
administered efaroxan, an imidazoline receptor antagonist or rauwolscine, an 
alpha 2 receptor antagonist. Sympathectomy also eliminated the ocular 
hypotensive response. Rilmenidine (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 microM) caused 5 +/- 1%, 
18 +/- 5%, 35 +/- 10%, and 48 +/- 9% inhibition, respectively, of 
3H-norepinephrine overflow whereas 10 microM efaroxan or rauwolscine caused 
enhancement of norepinephrine release by 102 +/- 23% or 86 +/- 25%, 
respectively. Furthermore, pretreatment with efaroxan or rauwolscine partially 
antagonized the inhibition of norepinephrine release induced by rilmenidine. In 
other experiments, rilmenidine (1 microM) inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated 
cAMP accumulation in rabbit iris-ciliary bodies by 43 +/- 9% which was 
antagonized by 10 microM efaroxan or rauwolscine. Rilmenidine induced large 
increases in [Ca2+]i in rabbit nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells which were 
effectively antagonized by efaroxan or rauwolscine.
CONCLUSIONS: These in vivo and in vitro data suggest that the ocular hypotensive 
activity induced by rilmenidine is due, in part, to suppression of sympathetic 
neuroeffector function in the rabbit ciliary body and that alpha 2 adrenergic 
receptors and/or imidazoline1 receptors are involved.
