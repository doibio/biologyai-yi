Rilmenidine is a novel antihypertensive agent related to alpha 2-agonists. 
Pharmacologic and clinical data concerning efficacy and acceptability of 
rilmenidine, its effects on physiologic functions, and hypothesis of mechanism 
of action are described in this report. The dominant aspect of rilmenidine is 
the observed dissociation at therapeutic doses between antihypertensive and 
central effects. In this respect, several findings resulting from fundamental 
pharmacology, clinical pharmacology, and therapeutics differentiate rilmenidine 
from clonidine and related drugs. Hypotheses to explain the results observed 
with rilmenidine involve unknown properties that could counteract with the alpha 
2-adrenoceptor-mediated sedation, respective contribution of central and 
peripheral components to the activity of rilmenidine, and possible contribution 
of imidazoline receptors.
