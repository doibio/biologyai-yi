Changes in hemodynamic parameters in intravenous infusion of drugs of the 
clonidine group were studied in Wistar rats by means of the radio-telemetry and 
catheter systems of arterial pressure (AP) recording. Clonidine (5 
micrograms/kg), rilmenidine (300 micrograms/kg), and moxonidine (100 
micrograms/kg) were found to cause significant decrease in AD and bradycardia 
whatever the method of AD measurement used. However, the degree of the 
hypotensive and negative cardiochronotropic effects of the central action drugs 
was higher in rats with radio-telemetry transmitters. The results provide 
evidence that the radio-telemetry system of monitoring of the hemodynamic 
parameters is more sensitive and accurate for evaluating the effect of the drugs 
under study.
