Since Bousquet et al. discovered the imidazoline binding sites (IBS) two decades 
ago, when they realized that the antihypertensive drug clonidine interacts not 
only with the alpha2-adrenenoceptors (alpha2-AR) but also with a distinct 
imidazoline preferring binding site, these receptors have been paid a great deal 
of attention. At least two subtypes, I1 and I2, have been characterised based on 
their binding affinity for different radioligands, but their structures still 
remain unknown. The pharmacological profile of these IBSs has been the objective 
of several and very thorough reviews. However, a medicinal chemistry overview of 
the different IBS ligands prepared to date has never been attempted. In this 
study, we attempt to compile all the different chemical structures reported to 
date as IBS ligands and classify them in function of their chemical structure 
and binding affinity for the different IBS subtypes. Thus, we comment on the 
different endogenous IBS ligands known as well as the drugs described to 
interact with the I1-IBS which have found application as antihypertensive drugs. 
Then, we review those compounds described in the literature to interact with the 
I2-IBS, classifying them by their chemical families (imidazolines, guanidines, 
2-aminoimidazolines, beta-carbolines). Finally, some conclusions are drawn.
