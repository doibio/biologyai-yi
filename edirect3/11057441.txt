OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of rilmenidine with those of amlodipine on 
blood pressure, glucose metabolism, plasma lipid concentration and fibrinolysis 
parameters.
DESIGN: A four-month randomized double-blind, parallel group study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Obese hypertensive patients with hypertriglyceridaemia (> 
or = 2.3 mmol/l) and impaired glucose tolerance (OMS-ADA) were included (n = 
52). A placebo run-in period of 2 weeks was followed by 4 months of double-blind 
treatment with either rilmenidine or amlodipine. Blood pressure was recorded 
using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Glucose metabolism was evaluated by an oral 
glucose tolerance test
RESULTS: Of the 52 patients recruited, 47 (21 rilmenidine and 26 amlodipine) 
completed the 4-month treatment period. The intention-to-treat analysis showed a 
comparable reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) with 
the two anti-hypertensive treatments (rilmenidine -13.9/-13.5 mmHg; amlodipine - 
17.6/-15.0 mmHg). Insulin concentrations under basal conditions and 2 h after a 
standard oral glucose load did not change significantly after treatment in both 
groups. Plasma glucose under basal conditions and 2 h after a standard oral 
glucose load as well as the area under the plasma glucose concentration curve 
tended to decrease in the rilmenidine group and to increase in the amlodipine 
group so that the changes in these parameters were significantly different 
between the two study groups (P= 0.041, P = 0.042 and P = 0.015, respectively). 
Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen and PAI-1 activity were 
only decreased in the rilmenidine group (not statistically significant).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that rilmenidine and amlodipine have a 
comparable anti-hypertensive effect but only rilmenidine is able to improve 
glucose metabolism.
