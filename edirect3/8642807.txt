The centrally acting, antihypertensive drug rilmenidine has activity at both 
imidazoline-preferring receptors (IPRs) and alpha 2-adrenoceptors: the IPR has 
been proposed to be the predominant receptor responsible for the hypotensive 
effects of rilmenidine. In the present study, the neuroanatomic regions of the 
brain involved in mediating the hypotensive response to rilmenidine were 
investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats with the use of 
[14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography. The selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist 
B-HT 933 was also studied for comparison. Rilmenidine (1 mg/kg s.c.) and B-HT 
933 (2 mg/kg s.c.) induced significant and similar reductions in mean arterial 
pressure (-24 +/- 2 and -18 +/- 5 mm Hg. respectively) and in heart rate (-62 
+/- 29 and -69 +/- 14 beats/min. respectively), whereas the vehicle had no 
significant hemodynamic effects. [14C]2-Deoxyglucose autoradiography revealed 
significant reductions in glucose use in the following structures of 
rilmenidine-treated rats: intermediolateral cell column of the thoracic spinal 
cord, area postrema, ventrolateral medulla, nucleus tractus solitarius, and 
cuneate nucleus, B-HT 933 did not significantly influence glucose use in any 
neuroanatomic structure examined. These results provide support for the 
functional involvement of brainstem cardiovascular control centres and the 
involvement of IPRs in the hypotensive response to rilmenidine.
