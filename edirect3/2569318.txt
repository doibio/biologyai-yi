It has recently been shown that imidazoline alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, such as 
clonidine and UK 14,304, selectively bind to both alpha 2- and imidazoline 
receptors in basolateral membranes from rabbit renal proximal tubule. In order 
to define the relative affinity of three antihypertensive alpha 2-agonists for 
the two classes of receptors, we performed competition studies of imidazoline 
alpha 2-antagonist 3H-RX 781094 and nonimidazoline antagonist 3H-rauwolscine 
binding to basolateral membranes from rabbit proximal tubule. The order of 
potency for inhibition of radioligand binding to basolateral membranes was 
rilmenidine greater than clonidine greater than guanfacine and clonidine greater 
than guanfacine greater than rilmenidine for 3H-RX 781094 and 3H-rauwolscine 
binding, respectively. These data show that not only clonidine, but also 
rilmenidine and guanfacine, drugs usually used as specific alpha 2-agonists, 
bind to both alpha 2- and imidazoline receptors. The higher affinity of these 
molecules for one or the other class of receptors could explain their different 
capacity to induce hypotension and side effects.
