The bioavailability of two rilmenidine tablet formulations was compared in 
healthy male (17) and female (8) subjects, aged 18 to 36 years, during a 
laboratory-blind, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, cross-over study under 
fasting conditions. In each treatment phase subjects received a single dose of 
1.544 mg rilmenidine dihydrogen phosphate (CAS 85409-38-7), equivalent to 1 mg 
rilmenidine (CAS 54187-04-1). Consecutive dosing was separated by a drug-free 
wash-out period of 7 d. Following each dosing, serial venous blood samples were 
collected over a period of 48 h for the determination of plasma rilmenidine 
concentrations by means of a validated LCMS/MS method. The most frequently 
reported drug-related adverse events were dizziness and headache ranging from 
mild to moderate in intensity. The geometric mean C(max) of rilmenidine for the 
reference and test products was 3.73 and 3.97 ng/ml, respectively. The 
corresponding geometric mean AUC(0-infinity)) was 34.0 and 35.1 ng x h/ml. 
T(max) for both products under investigation appeared at 1.33 h. The test 
product was shown to be bioequivalent to the reference product with respect to 
all pharmacokinetic variables investigated.
