The effects of acute and chronic administration of rilmenidine on blood 
pressure, heart rate and baroreflex function were assessed in two groups of six 
conscious dogs. Baroreflex function was evaluated using increasing doses of 
glyceryl trinitrate and phenylephrine to decrease and increase blood pressure 
respectfully. Acute administration of rilmenidine (1 mg/kg p.o.) reduced (P less 
than 0.05) blood pressure and heart rate, and enhanced (P less than 0.05) 
baroreflex function to increases in blood pressure with phenylephrine, but not 
to decreases in blood pressure by glyceryl trinitrate. Following chronic 
administration of rilmenidine, blood pressure remained lowered while heart rate 
and baroreflex function returned to control values.
