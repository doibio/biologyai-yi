The effect of rilmenidine (S 3341) and clonidine on the firing rate of locus 
ceruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe (DR) cells was studied in vivo after systemic and 
microiontophoretic administration. The effect of the 2 drugs was also studied in 
vitro on brain slices containing LC cells. Rilmenidine and clonidine inhibited 
the firing of LC and DR neurons. Complementary experiments performed with 
yohimbine and prazosin demonstrated that the effect of LC is related to an 
agonistic action on alpha 2 somatodendritic receptors, whereas the effect 
observed on DR cells is indirect. On LC cells, clonidine is 30 to 60 times as 
potent as rilmenidine. These observations may be related to less sedative 
effects of rilmenidine than of clonidine.
