The present paper summarizes our studies concerning the involvement of 
imidazoline and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the cardiovascular actions of centrally 
acting drugs rilmenidine, clonidine and methyldopa. We have found that they 
produce very similar cardiovascular autonomic effects which relate directly to 
the function of central monoamine neurotransmitters. They mimic certain elements 
of the noradrenergic neuron system in the central nervous system, in particular 
the brainstem actions which involve hypotension, bradycardia and resetting of 
the baroreceptor heart rate reflex. By contrast they turn off serotonergic 
pathways that are pressor, produce tachycardia and inhibit the baroreceptor 
heart rate reflex. Recent studies using specific receptors antagonist drugs 
idazoxan and 2-methoxy-idazoxan indicate that in conscious rabbits the 
imidazoline receptor actions of rilmenidine is of primary importance at doses 
which would be considered clinically relevant. We further conclude that the 
alpha 2-adrenoceptors and the imidazoline receptors are likely to be located in 
series i.e. along the same cardiovascular autonomic pathways in the brainstem 
but presumably at different sites.
