The imidazoline receptors have recently been discovered to be involved in 
central nervous system control of blood pressure (I-1 receptor) and in 
neuroprotection for cerebral ischemia (I-2 receptor). A new class of 
central-acting antihypertensive agents has been developed, the imidazoline 
receptor agonists (rilmenidine and moxonidine), which control blood pressure 
effectively without the adverse effects of sedation and mental depression that 
are usually associated with central-acting antihypertensives. This new 
generation of central-acting antihypertensive agents are highly selective for 
the imidazoline receptor, while having a low affinity for alpha 2-adrenergic 
receptors.
