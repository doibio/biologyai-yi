Previously, changes in position and slope of the pressure-natriuresis 
relationship have been used to characterize antihypertensive drugs in basic 
research. Rilmenidine may chronically reduce arterial pressure via central 
nervous system and renal imidazoline receptors. The present experiments were 
used to examine the shift in the pressure-natriuresis relationship during 
rilmenidine administration. We examined the effects of twice daily doses (1 and 
3 mg/kg) for 6 days on the pressure-natriuresis relationship determined for 
control and treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) drinking tap water or 
1% NaCl. The pressure-natriuresis relationship was shifted to the left for the 3 
mg/kg dose and the slope was no different from the control. These experiments 
also indicated that rilmenidine might have an effect on sodium preference which 
was confirmed in a third series of experiments by permitting control and treated 
(3 mg/kg) SHR access to both tap water and 1% NaCl. This lack of change in slope 
indicates that, during rilmenidine treatment, the arterial pressure is 
relatively insensitive to sodium intake. The shift to the left indicates a 
restoration of the pressure-natriuresis relationship after chronic treatment 
with rilmenidine and a resetting of the long-term blood pressure control. 
Rilmenidine also reduces salt appetite in the SHR.
