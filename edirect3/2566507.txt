The selectivity of three centrally acting antihypertensive agents for the 
medullary imidazoline-preferring receptors (IPR) versus cortical 
alpha-adrenoceptors was investigated in human brain. [3H]Clonidine binding was 
studied in various membrane preparations. Competition experiments were 
performed. Cortical membrane preparations were used as they mainly contained 
classical alpha-adrenoceptors whereas medullary membrane preparations from the 
nucleus reticularis lateralis contained only IPR insensitive to catecholamines. 
Rilmenidine, a new antihypertensive agent, appeared 2.5 and 3.5 times more 
selective than clonidine and guanfacine, respectively, for medullary IPR sites 
than for cortical alpha-adrenoceptors, thus providing a possible explanation for 
the low sedative effects of this new molecule.
