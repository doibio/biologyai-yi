Comparative autoradiography revealed that the imidazolines [3H]p-aminoclonidine 
and [3H]idazoxan labelled high densities of alpha 2A-adrenoceptor sites in the 
inner medulla and inner stripe of the outer medulla of rat kidney. In contrast, 
the oxazoline [3H]rilmenidine labelled a high density of non-adrenergic sites in 
the cortex and outer stripe of the outer medulla, a lower density in the inner 
stripe and inner medulla and a low density of alpha 2A-adrenoceptor sites in 
inner medulla. The existence of novel, non-adrenergic oxazoline sites of 
potential functional importance in rat kidney has important implications for the 
classification of imidazoline receptors.
