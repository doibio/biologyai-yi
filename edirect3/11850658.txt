The central antihypertensive drugs such as methyldopa or clonidine have been 
agents of importance in the therapy of hypertension. Due to the side effects and 
the rebound hypertensive phenomenon in the case of clonidine, the use of these 
agents have been clearly diminished. There are several evidences that a new type 
of receptor, imidazoline receptor, is present in the central nervous system and 
in the periphery. A specific agonist for these receptors, rilmenidine, has been 
studied in experimental animals and in hypertensive patients. Clinical studies 
have shown that rilmenidine exhibits similar efficacy but a better tolerability 
compared to clonidine. Rilmenidine may represent a good alternative in the 
therapy of hypertension.
