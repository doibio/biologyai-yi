We review three new classes of antihypertensive drugs: imidazolines, monatepil, 
and neutral endopeptidase inhibitors. Imidazolines are a new generation of 
central acting drugs. Because of their greater affinity for imidazoline 
receptors rather than alpha 2-adrenoreceptors, they cause less fatigue and dry 
mouth than the older central acting drugs. Monatepil is a single drug with both 
calcium antagonist and peripheral alpha 1-antagonist properties. This agent not 
only lowers blood pressure but also lowers serum cholesterol, an effect mediated 
by its alpha-antagonism, and has anti-lipid peroxidation properties. Monatepil 
might become an effective antiatherosclerosis drug. Neutral endopeptidase 
inhibitors lower blood pressure by inhibiting the metabolism of atrial 
natriuretic peptide and other vasoactive peptides.
