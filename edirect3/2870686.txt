The effects on blood pressure and heart rate of S 3341 
[(N-dicyclopropylmethyl)-amino-2-oxazoline] were investigated in rats and cats. 
Upon i.v. injection in pithed rats, S 3341 produced pressor responses which were 
antagonized by prazosin as well as by yohimbine. In pentobarbitone-anesthetized 
rats S 3341 produced a short-lasting increase in mean arterial pressure, 
followed by a long-lasting reduction. During a 12-day, continuous subcutaneous 
infusion in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, S 3341 reduced blood 
pressure and heart rate. Upon cessation of treatment, an overshoot of heart rate 
and blood pressure lability occurred. The hypotensive effect was abolished by 
reserpinization of the rats. S 3341 was more potent in reducing mean arterial 
pressure upon infusion via the vertebral artery than after infusion via the 
femoral artery of chloralose-anesthetized cats. S 3341 did not prolong the 
hexobarbitone-induced loss of righting reflex in mice. S 3341 was more potent in 
displacing [3H]clonidine than [3H]prazosin from their specific binding sites in 
rat brain membranes. These data characterize S 3341 as a clonidine-like, 
centrally acting antihypertensive drug. The lack of sedative effect, as assessed 
by the prolongation of hexobarbitone-induced sleeping in mice, remains to be 
clarified.
