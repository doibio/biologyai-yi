Beta-endorphin, deltorphin II, [D-Ala2, Phe4, Gly5-ol-enkephalin (DAGO) as well 
as endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2 injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) 
induced gastroprotective action. It has been raised that endogenous opioids may 
have a central role in maintaining gastric mucosal integrity. Therefore we aimed 
to study the role of endogenous opioid system in the gastroprotective action 
induced by activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors, nociceptin- and 
cannabinoid-receptors. Our results suggest that the non-selective opioid 
receptor antagonist naloxone (27 nmol i.c.v.) and the delta-opioid receptor 
antagonist naltrindole (5 nmol i.c.v.) abolished the mucosal protective effect 
of alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine (470 pmol i.c.v.) and rilmenidine (45 
pmol i.c.v.), nociceptin (1 nmol i.c.v.) and the cannabinoid receptor agonist 
anandamide (110 nmol i.c.v.). Based on our findings it can be raised that opioid 
system besides its well known regulatory functions might be involved in 
maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity.
