Noradrenaline release evoked by electrical stimulation was recorded in the rat 
hypothalamus by in vivo electrochemistry. Rilmenidine (0.3-10 mg kg-1 i.v.) did 
not diminish this evoked release while clonidine induced a dose-dependent 
decrease. These results further suggest that the antihypertensive action of 
rilmenidine is not mediated by central alpha 2-adrenoceptors and might explain 
why, unlike clonidine, rilmenidine does not have sedative effects.
