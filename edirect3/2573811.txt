Evidence gathered over the past ten years supports the existence of subtypes of 
alpha 2-adrenoceptors. A receptor which resembles the alpha 2-adrenoceptor, 
called the imidazoline-preferring receptor (IPR), is virtually insensitive to 
catecholamines but binds selectively imidazolines and oxazolines such as 
idazoxan and rilmenidine. In contrast, the catecholamine-preferring alpha 
2-adrenoceptor is preferentially activated by catecholamines including 
alpha-methylnorepinephrine and epinephrine and is antagonized selectively by 
rauwolscine. In addition to different pharmacological profiles to agonists and 
antagonists, the IPR and alpha 2-adrenoceptors show differences in anatomical 
distribution and molecular properties. The evidence has been drawn primarily 
from in vitro physiological and radioligand binding studies, but is gradually 
extending into in vivo and even clinical studies.
