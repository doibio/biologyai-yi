Agonists of I1 imidazolin receptors are a new drug groups which was registered 
for the treatment of hypertension. Their antihypertensive action is comparable 
with current antihypertensives (hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril, atenolol, 
nifedipine retard) and causes a drop of the systolic BP by cca 15-20 mm Hg and a 
drop of the diastolic BP by 10-15 mm Hg with a probable normalization of the 
blood pressure in cca 60% patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Agonists 
of I1 imidazoline receptors are suitable in particular for the treatment of 
hypertension associated with metabolic syndrome. Their effect in patients with 
ischaemic heart disease or after a cerebrovascular attack is not known and 
despite very promising theoretical prerequisites they are not indicated in 
patients with chronic heart failure.
