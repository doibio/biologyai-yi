OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the hypotensive and sympathetic baroreflex 
inhibition by rilmenidine administered systemically are mediated via imidazoline 
receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM).
METHODS: Initial dose-response curves to rilmenidine were determined in urethane 
anaesthetized rabbits. Effects of a single intravenous dose of rilmenidine (445 
microg/kg) on the renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) baroreflex were 
examined before and after microinjection into the RVLM of the mixed 
imidazoline/alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan and the alpha2-adrenoceptor 
antagonist 2-methoxyidazoxan (2-MI).
RESULTS: Intravenous administration of rilmenidine lowered mean arterial 
pressure and RSNA, inhibited the RSNA baroreflex range by 33% and shifted the 
baroreflex curve to the left. Idazoxan injected into the RVLM reversed the 
hypotension and completely restored the baroreflex curve at doses that did not 
affect the hypotension produced by the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist 
alpha-methylnoradrenaline. The alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 2-MI also 
reversed the rilmenidine sympatho-inhibition suggesting that 
alpha2-adrenoceptors are activated as well.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that the hypotensive and 
sympatho-inhibitory actions of systemic rilmenidine are primarily mediated via 
imidazoline receptors in the RVLM. However, alpha2-adrenoceptors are also 
involved, probably as a direct result of the imidazoline receptor action.
