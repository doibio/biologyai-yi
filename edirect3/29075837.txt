Preclinical data have shown that rilmenidine can regulate autophagy in models of 
Huntington's disease (HD), providing a potential route to alter the disease 
course in patients. Consequently, a 2-year open-label study examining the 
tolerability and feasibility of rilmenidine in mild-moderate HD was undertaken. 
18 non-demented patients with mild to moderate HD took daily doses of 1 mg 
Rilmenidine for 6 months and 2 mg for a further 18 months followed by a 3-month 
washout period. The primary outcome was the number of withdrawals and serious 
adverse events. Secondary outcomes included safety parameters and changes in 
disease-specific variables, such as motor, cognitive and functional performance, 
structural MRI and serum metabolomic analysis. 12 patients completed the study; 
reasons for withdrawal included problems tolerating study procedures (MRI, and 
venepuncture), depression requiring hospital admission and logistical reasons. 
Three serious adverse events were recorded, including hospitalisation for 
depression, but none were thought to be drug-related. Changes in secondary 
outcomes were analysed as the annual rate of change in the study group. The 
overall change was comparable to changes seen in recent large observational 
studies in HD patients, though direct statistical comparisons to these studies 
were not made. Chronic oral administration of rilmenidine is feasible and 
well-tolerated and future, larger, placebo-controlled, studies in HD are 
warranted.
