PURPOSE: Glaucoma is the main cause of blindness in the developed countries. Its 
progress can be diminished by decreasing intraocular pressure (IOP) using 
pharmacological or surgical treatment. Antiglaucoma agents, alpha 2-adrenergic's 
receptor agonists have been known for several years as IOP lowering. Due to the 
fact that the majority of them turned out to be imidazoline receptor agonists, 
it is worth checking if selective imidazoline receptor (l1) agonists alter IOP. 
Preliminary animal experiments show that they lower IOP. In our study we 
examined the influence of rilmenidine, a potent l1 receptor agonist, on IOP in 
rabbits. Furthermore, we tried to find out whether l1 and alpha 2 receptor 
antagonists (efaroxan and rauwolscine) counteract the pharmacological effect of 
rilmenidine.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted on adult male White New Zealand 
rabbits. All the substances were administered topically, and IOP was measured by 
applanation tonometry after topical anaesthesia before and 1, 3 and 5 hours 
after drug instillation.
RESULTS: Rilmenidine showed the lowering effect on IOP at the concentration of 
0.4%. Efaroxan and rauwolscine partly inhibited rilmenidine effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Rilmenidine is a potential antiglaucoma agent, though further 
studies are necessary.
