We investigated whether inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis with 
N-omega-nitro-L-arginine (NNA), a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), 
would modify the volume of the focal ischemic infarction produced by occlusion 
of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in spontaneously hypertensive rats. NNA was 
infused for 1 h (2.4 mg/kg/h) immediately following occlusion of the MCA. NNA 
increased lesion volume 24 h later by 32% over controls (150.8 +/- 16.6 to 199.2 
+/- 17.4 mm3; p less than 0.001, n = 6). This effect was antagonized by 
co-infusion of L- but not D-arginine. The antihypertensive rilmenidine (0.75 
mg/kg) reduced the lesion by 27% (p less than 0.05, n = 4). Changes in lesion 
size were confined to the penumbra. NNA increased arterial pressure (AP) (118 
+/- 8.9 to 149 +/- 16.0 mm Hg; p less than 0.01, n = 3) but did not change 
regional CBF. However, elevation of AP did not change the lesion volume or 
distribution. We conclude that inhibition of the constitutive form of NOS in 
vivo increases the volume of focal ischemic infarction as a consequence of 
reduced NO biosynthesis. The absence of NO availability may extend lesion 
formation by inhibition of reactive hyperemia, platelet disaggregation, and/or 
release of neuroprotective neuromodulators in the penumbra, which may counteract 
and override any of its neurotoxic actions.
