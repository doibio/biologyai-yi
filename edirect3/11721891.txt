Rilmenidine is an imidazoline derivative that appears to lower blood pressure 
(BP) by an interaction with imidazoline (I1) receptors in the brainstem (and 
kidneys). Rilmenidine is as effective in monotherapy as all other first-line 
classes of drugs, including diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists. It is well tolerated and can 
be taken in combination for greater efficacy. Sedation and dry mouth are not 
prominent side effects and withdrawal hypertension is not seen when treatment is 
stopped abruptly. Recently, in addition to a reduction in BP, this agent has 
been shown to improve glucose tolerance, lipid risk factors, and insulin 
sensitivity. These changes would be consistent with a reduction in long-term 
cardiovascular risk, as would recently described actions on the heart (reducing 
left ventricular hypertrophy) and the kidney (reducing microalbuminuria). 
Although no data are yet available from prospective long-term outcome studies, 
rilmenidine could represent an important new development in antihypertensive 
therapy and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
