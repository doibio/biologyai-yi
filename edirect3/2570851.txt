Studies were carried out to determine whether rilmenidine, a recently introduced 
antihypertensive agent with a similar mechanism of action of clonidine, 
possesses histamine-like activity on tissues responding to histamine H2-receptor 
agonists. In guinea-pig isolated atria, both histamine and clonidine caused 
concentration-dependent positive chronotropic effects which were blocked by the 
histamine H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine (5 microM); in contrast, rilmenidine 
produced a concentration-dependent negative chronotropic effect which was not 
altered by cimetidine. In stilboestrol-treated rat isolated uterus contracted by 
KCl, histamine and clonidine produces concentration-dependent relaxations which 
were blocked by cimetidine (5 microM); rilmenidine also produced relaxation, but 
this was not affected by cimetidine (5 microM). These findings suggest that 
rilmenidine, unlike clonidine, does not activate histamine H2-receptors in 
either guinea-pig atria or rat uterus.
