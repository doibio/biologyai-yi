2-Aminothiazolines share an isosteric relationship with imidazolines and 
oxazolines with antihypertensive activity mainly mediated by the imidazoline 
I1-receptor. In the present work, we have prepared five aminothiazolines, 
following a previously described synthetic pathway. Aminothiazolines derived 
from dicyclopropylmethylamine (ATZ1) and cyclohexylamine (3) are unprecedented 
in the literature. Competitive radioligand assay was carried out with all 
synthetic compounds, and the I1 receptor affinity in comparison to rilmenidine 
in PC12 cells was determined. Surprisingly, the rilmenidine isoster (ATZ1) 
showed no I1-receptor interaction. Diethyl (ATZ4) and 2-ethyl-hexylamine (ATZ5) 
derivatives bind to the receptor with 11.98 and 10.94nmol/l, respectively. These 
compounds were selected for in vivo experiments. Both compounds reduced the 
blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The hypotensive effect 
of these compounds was abrogated in the presence of α2 adrenergic (yohimbine) 
and I1 (efaroxan) receptor antagonists suggesting that both aminothiazolines 
bind to the adrenergic and imidazoline receptors. Lipinski's descriptors of the 
synthesized aminothiazolines were calculated and are similar to the known 
imidazoline I1 receptor ligands. 3D-Similarity between ATZ5 and agmatine, the 
natural imidazoline receptor ligand, was also observed.
