OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the SNS 
on hemodynamic, metabolic, and microvascular alterations in a rat model of 
HFD-induced MS with salt supplementation.
METHODS: In total, 40 adult male Wistar rats were fed normal chow (n = 10) or a 
HFD (n = 30) for 20 weeks. Thereafter, the HFD group received the centrally 
acting sympatho-modulatory drugs clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) or rilmenidine (1 mg/kg) 
or vehicle (n = 10/group) orally by gavage. FCD was evaluated using intravital 
video microscopy, and the SCD was evaluated using histochemical analysis.
RESULTS: The pharmacological modulation of the SNS induced concomitant 
reductions in SBP, HR and plasma catecholamine levels. These effects were 
accompanied by a reversal of functional and structural capillary rarefaction in 
the skeletal muscle in both treated groups and an increase in SCD in the left 
ventricle only in the rilmenidine group. Improvement of the lipid profile and of 
glucose intolerance was also obtained only with rilmenidine treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Modulation of sympathetic overactivity results in the reversal of 
microvascular rarefaction in the skeletal muscle and left ventricle and improves 
metabolic parameters in an experimental model of MS in rats.
