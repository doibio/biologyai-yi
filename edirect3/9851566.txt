In the present study we investigated the chronopharmacological dependence of 
dose-dependent hypotensive and cardiochronotropic effects of the 
imidazoline-like drugs (clonidine, rilmenidine and moxonidine) in stroke-prone 
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP), using radio-telemetric system (Data 
Sciences, USA). The 24-h blood pressure, heart rate and locomotor activity 
profiles showed peak values during the rats' active phase during the night 
period. The degree of hypotensive and bradycardic effects of all drugs were most 
evident at this time and occurred in the absence of a change in locomotor 
activity. These studies show that clonidine, rilmenidine and moxonidine decrease 
blood pressure and heart rate in a time-dependent manner in SHR-SP. It was 
demonstrated that the degree and duration of hypotensive action of 
imidazoline-like drugs vary with the time of drug administration.
