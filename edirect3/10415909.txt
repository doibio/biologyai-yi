The alpha 2-adrenergic agonist [3H]clonidine and antagonist [3H]idazoxan also 
label I1 and I2 imidazoline receptors in striatum membranes. They are 
investigated here in striata from the dog, rat, mouse, rabbit, calf, monkey, and 
human. I1 receptors were barely detected in the dog, rat, and mouse and only 
further examined by competition binding experiments in calf, rabbit, and human. 
I2 receptors were further examined in all species. The centrally acting 
vasodilators clonidine and rilmenidine were more potent than moxonidine at the 
I1 receptors. They displayed low potency for the I2 receptors in all species 
except the rat. In all species examined, the nonsubstituted imidazoline 
derivatives idazoxan and RX801077 displayed high affinity for the I1 and I2 
receptors. Conversely, both stereoisomers of the alkoxy-substituted 
imidazoline-derivative efaroxan displayed low affinity. The matching binding 
characteristics of these compounds further stress the structural similarity of 
the ligand binding sites of I1 and I2 receptors.
