The imidazoline receptors recently have been discovered to be involved in the 
central nervous system control of sympathetic outflow. A new class of centrally 
acting antihypertensive agents, the imidazoline receptor agonists (rilmenidine 
and moxonidine), have been developed to control blood pressure effectively 
without the adverse effects of sedation and mental depression that usually are 
associated with centrally acting antihypertensive agents. This new generation of 
centrally acting antihypertensive agents is highly selective for the imidazoline 
receptor but has a low affinity for alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors. The 
usefulness of these agents in the treatment of congestive heart failure has not 
been demonstrated.
