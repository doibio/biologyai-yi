Rilmenidine is an antihypertensive agent with selectivity for I1 imidazoline 
receptors that acts both centrally by reducing sympathetic overactivity and in 
the kidney by inhibiting the Na+/H+ antiport. Rilmenidine provides 
antihypertensive efficacy comparable with that of diuretics, beta-blockers, 
calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. 
Experience from trials and clinical practice highlights rilmenidine's clinical 
and metabolic acceptability in hypertensive populations, including those at 
special risk because of old age, renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, or 
dyslipidemia. In the at-risk hypertensive, rilmenidine reduces left ventricular 
hypertrophy to a similar degree to other reference agents. New studies show a 
significant improvement in glucose metabolism in metabolic syndrome patients 
treated with rilmenidine, and a significant reduction in microalbuminuria during 
rilmenidine treatment of hypertensive type 2 diabetics. Thus the 
efficacy/tolerance ratio of rilmenidine supports its role as a first-line 
antihypertensive option for all groups of hypertensive patient, with specific 
advantages in some at-risk populations.
