Alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists stimulate growth hormone secretion but have no 
acute effects on plasma cortisol under basal conditions.

Ten normal male subjects were administered clonidine (0.1 and 0.2 mg) or a 
highly-selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist S 3341 (1 and 2 mg) on separate 
occasions in a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled study; blood samples 
were obtained for measurement of serum GH and plasma cortisol via an indwelling 
venous cannula for 4 h after each drug administration. Both clonidine and S 3341 
were equally effective at lowering supine, and particularly standing BP; both 
also caused mild sedation, although this was slightly less marked for S 3341. 
High doses of both clonidine and S 3341 significantly increased serum GH (peak 
increment after clonidine: 18.8 +/- 5.5 mU/l (mean +/- SEM); peak increment 
after S 3341: 21.1 +/- 4.8 mU/l). Neither drug affected plasma cortisol. It is 
concluded that GH release may be stimulated by alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonism. As 
S 3341 has slightly less central activity than clonidine at the doses employed, 
but is at least equally potent at stimulating GH release, it is probable that 
the alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation of GH release occurs outside the 
blood-brain barrier. The pituitary-adrenal axis appears resistant to 
manipulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors under basal conditions.
