Central imidazoline (I(1))-receptors have been recognised as targets of a new 
class of centrally acting antihypertensives. The stimulation of these 
I(1)-receptors induces peripheral sympatho-inhibition and a reduction of 
(elevated) blood pressure. Moxonidine and rilmenidine are the prototypes of this 
new class of centrally acting antihypertensives. These imidazoline receptor 
stimulants are effective antihypertensives with a haemodynamic profile which is 
attractive from a pathophysiological point of view. Since both moxonidine and 
rilmenidine have a much weaker affinity for central (2)-adrenoceptors than 
classic centrally acting drugs, for example, clonidine and alpha-methyl-DOPA, 
the side-effects profile of the I(1)-receptor stimulants is significantly 
better. The imidazoline (I(1))-receptor stimulants are the subject of the 
current survey. They appear to offer the possibility of developing centrally 
acting antihypertensives with the same attractive haemodynamic characteristics 
as the classic alpha(2)-adrenoceptor stimulants, but with clearly better 
tolerability. Their potential use in the treatment of congestive heart failure 
and the metabolic syndrome is subject to clinical investigation.
