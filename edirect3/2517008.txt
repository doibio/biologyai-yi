The efficacy and acceptability of Rilmenidine (RIL) were assessed in a 
multicentre, controlled, double-blind trial versus hydrochlorothiazide (HCZ) in 
patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After an initial 4 week washout 
period on placebo, patients with diastolic BP of between 90 and 110 mmHg were 
administered in monotherapy either RIL 1 mg or HCZ 25 mg for four weeks (Day 
0-Day 28). In the following four weeks (Day 28-Day 56), those with diastolic BP 
of over 90 mmHg were given, in association, the antihypertensive agent that they 
had not received initially. The other patients continued the trial with single 
daily doses of monotherapy. Two hundred and fourty four patients (48.4 +/- 0.6 
years) with supine systolic and diastolic BP of 155.86 +/- 0.96 mmHg and 101.02 
+/- 0.28 mmHg respectively were randomly allocated to two comparable treatment 
groups (RIL, n = 120 and HCZ, n = 124). The systolic and diastolic BP decreased 
significantly between Day 0 and Day 28, as much at Day 14 as at Day 28 in both 
treatment groups. The antihypertensive effect was comparable: at Day 28 the mean 
fall in systolic/diastolic BP was 16/10 mmHg in the RIL group and 15/9 mmHg in 
the HCZ group (NS). The clinical acceptability was equivalent in the two groups: 
secondary effects were responsible for one patient's withdrawal in each group 
and their incidence was 5% on average, 10% for the most common.(ABSTRACT
