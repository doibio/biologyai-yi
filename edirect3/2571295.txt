The acute renal excretory actions of several antihypertensive agents were 
assessed in healthy volunteers. Rilmenidine (1 mg) did not affect water and 
electrolyte balance. Beta-adrenergic blockers had little effect upon urinary 
composition, whereas diuretics caused significant urinary losses of fluid, 
sodium, potassium, and magnesium as expected. The vasodilators ketanserin and 
flosequinan did not affect water and electrolyte excretion. Ketanserin increased 
urate output in common with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which may 
act as facultative diuretics. Combining the angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor captopril (100 mg) or rilmenidine (1 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (25 
mg) had little influence upon the known actions of the diuretic. When the 
beta-blocker pindolol (10 mg) was given with the diuretic clopamide (5 mg), 
beneficial effects were noted; potassium and magnesium losses were markedly 
reduced, whereas the natriuretic and diuretic effects of clopamide were 
unchanged. These short-term studies in healthy volunteers provide useful 
pointers to some possible pharmacodynamic effects of antihypertensive drugs in 
patients.
