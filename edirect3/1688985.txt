Adaptations to the effects of clonidine (CL) and rilmenidine (R) were studied 
during a 12-week training program (swimming) in spontaneously hypertensive rats 
(SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was regularly 
measured during this period. Body weight (BW) was determined at the beginning 
and at the 12th week. Plasma parameters, cardiac determinations, vasopressin 
(pAVP), and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured only at the end of the 
experiment. Both SBP and ponderal benefit were reduced by CL, R, and training. 
Contrary to beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, we found no inhibition of the 
beneficial effect on SBP of training in combination with CL or R. Plasma and 
hypothalamic vasopressin were reduced by both drugs but only CL increased plasma 
renin activity (PRA) although its mechanisms of action are still not clearly 
understood. Our results suggest that CL and R as well as swim training can be 
considered as an effective countermeasure in SHR. Moreover, the heterogeneity of 
action of CL and R on some of the parameters tested is in favor of different 
pharmacological properties for these drugs.
