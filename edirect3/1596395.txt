Clonidine, idazoxan, rilmenidine, and comparable agents bind to imidazol(in)e 
(IR), as well as alpha 2-adrenergic, receptors. Interaction with IRs mediates 
the hypotension elicited by these drugs at their site of action in the rostral 
ventrolateral medulla oblongata (RVL) and probably the neuroprotection in focal 
ischemic cerebral infarction. Unlike alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, IRs are not 
coupled to G-proteins. Their native ligand may be clonidine-displacing substance 
(CDS), a potent, partially purified adrenomedullary secretagogue, distributed 
regionally in brain and some peripheral organs. IRs and CDS may be important in 
the genesis, expression, and/or therapy of hypertension and stroke.
