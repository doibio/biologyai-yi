OBJECTIVE: To determine the involvement of central imidazoline receptors in the 
cardiovascular actions of the chronically administered antihypertensive agents 
moxonidine, rilmenidine and clonidine.
DESIGN AND METHODS: In 21 rabbits with implanted fourth-ventricular catheters, 
we investigated the central effects of three cumulative doses of an 
I(1)-imidazoline/alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, efaroxan, and of an 
alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 2-methoxyidazoxan (2-MI), on the changes in 
blood pressure and heart rate (HR) elicited by chronic subcutaneous 
administration of moxonidine, rilmenidine and clonidine, after 1 and 3 weeks of 
treatment. A low, medium and high dose of 2-MI was matched to three doses of 
efaroxan, such that each produced equal reversal of the hypotension induced by 
fourth-ventricular alpha-methyldopa and hence produced a similar degree of 
alpha(2)-adrenoceptor blockade.
RESULTS: Clonidine and moxonidine, at doses of 1 mg/kg per day, and rilmenidine 
at 5 mg/kg per day, produced sustained reductions in mean arterial pressure of 
13 +/- 3, 15 +/- 2 and 13 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively over the 3-week treatment 
period, but did not alter HR. Central administration of efaroxan on day 9 and 
day 23 of treatment produced a greater increase in blood pressure than did 2-MI 
with all three antihypertensive agents. Blood pressure reached levels that were 
significantly above the original control values. By contrast, the 
alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist 2-MI only induced a rebound blood pressure 
effect in clonidine- and to a lesser extent in rilmenidine-treated rabbits. Both 
efaroxan and 2-MI produced a similar degree of tachycardia in moxonidine-, 
rilmenidine- and clonidine-treated animals.(2)
CONCLUSIONS: The greater effect of efaroxan compared to the 
alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist 2-MI suggests that the hypotension induced by 
chronic subcutaneous administration of moxonidine, rilmenidine and clonidine is 
mediated predominantly via an action on central imidazoline receptors. 
Furthermore, all agents showed a propensity to produce rebound hypertension with 
imidazoline receptor blockade. However, only clonidine showed a rebound 
phenomenon when challenged by acute central alpha(2)-adrenoceptor blockade
