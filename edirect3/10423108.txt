The classic centrally acting antihypertensives such as clonidine, guanfacine and 
alpha-methyl-DOPA (via its active metabolite alpha-methyl-noradrenaline) induce 
peripheral sympathoinhibition and a fall in blood pressure as a result of 
alpha2-adrenoceptor stimulation in the brain stem. These drugs have lost much of 
their clinical importance because of their unfavourable side-effects (sedation, 
dry mouth, impotence), which are also mediated by alpha2-adrenoceptors, although 
in other anatomical regions. Moxonidine and rilmenidine are the examples of a 
new class of centrally acting antihypertensives, which cause peripheral 
sympathoinhibition mediated by imidazoline (I1)-receptors in the rostral 
ventromedulla (RVLM). Their side-effect profile appears to be better than that 
of clonidine and alpha-methyl-DOPA, probably because of a weaker affinity for 
alpha2-adrenoceptors. The mode of action, haemodynamic profile, antihypertensive 
efficacy and adverse reactions of the classic and newer centrally acting 
antihypertensives are the subject of the present survey. Attention is also paid 
to other therapeutic applications of centrally acting antihypertensives, such as 
congestive heart failure and the metabolic syndrome.
