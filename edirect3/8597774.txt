Imidazoline (I1)-receptors in the central nervous system play a role in the 
central regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. Stimulation of these 
receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla induces peripheral 
sympathoinhibition, and hence a reduction of elevated blood pressure. The 
imidazoline derivatives moxonidine and rilmenidine are moderately selective I1 
receptor stimulants which have been introduced as centrally acting 
antihypertensives. Since they have little affinity for alpha 2-adrenoceptors, 
they may be expected to cause less sedation and dry mouth than the alpha 
2-adrenoceptor agonists clonidine and methyldopa. The concept of I1 receptors 
and their agonists therefore offers the possibility to develop centrally acting 
antihypertensives with a more favourable profile of adverse reactions than the 
classical alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulants such as clonidine and methyldopa.
