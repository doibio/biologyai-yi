"Non-adrenoceptor'-binding sites for [3H]clonidine (I1-sites) and [3H]idazoxan 
(I2-sites) are identified in calf striatum membranes. The pharmacological 
profile of both subtypes was investigated by competition binding with the 
imidazolines idazoxan, cirazoline, Bu 224 (2-(4,5-dihydroimidaz-2-yl)-quinoline) 
and Bu 239 (2-(4,5-dihydroimidaz-2-yl)-quinoxaline); the guanidino derivatives 
clonidine, moxonidine, guanabenz, amiloride and agmatine; the oxazoline 
rilmenidine and the imidazole histamine. The competition experiments indicate 
that both populations of imidazoline-binding sites in calf striatum consist of a 
high- (H) and a low-affinity (L) compartment. The monoamine oxidase (MAO) 
inhibitors pargyline (non-selective) and deprenyl (MAO-B-selective) have 
micromolar affinity for the I1-sites and much lower affinity for the I2-sites. 
The venom of the marine snail Conus geographus is the most potent of the 13 
tested Conus venom preparations. None of the tested venoms is able to 
discriminate between both sites.
