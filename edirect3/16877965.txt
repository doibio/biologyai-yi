OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of the centrally acting imidazoline-like 
compound rilmenidine on the circadian and short-term cardiovascular rhythms 
derived from continuous blood pressure (BP) recordings in patients with mild 
essential hypertension.
METHODS: This was a single-center, open study. Recordings were obtained from 
eight subjects, using a Portapres during two 24-h hospitalizations: the first 
after the inclusion visit and the second 4 weeks after starting rilmenidine 
treatment (1 or 2 mg/day). For circadian analysis of cardiovascular variables, 
10 min were selected every hour to obtain 24 periods per subject for each 
session. Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was estimated using the 
sequence technique and the cross-spectral analysis between systolic BP and 
interbeat intervals.
RESULTS: Rilmenidine significantly reduced the overall systolic and diastolic BP 
and heart rate (P < 0.001). The effects of rilmenidine on BP and heart rhythm 
were marked during the daytime. Rilmenidine reduced the low-frequency (LF) 
component of systolic BP variability throughout the 24 h. The highest values of 
spontaneous BRS were observed at night. Rilmenidine increased the BRS obtained 
by the slope of the sequence method throughout the 24-h period (P < 0.001). The 
LF gain was significantly increased with rilmenidine during the day and the 
night.
CONCLUSIONS: Rilmenidine may differentially affect the baroreflex-dependent 
(phasic or reflex) and the baroreflex-independent (tonic) autonomic outflow. The 
24-h approach reinforced this concept, since indexes of BRS were increased 
throughout the 24-h period while BP was reduced during the daytime.
