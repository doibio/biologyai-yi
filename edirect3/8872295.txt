A group of clinically useful antihypertensive agents, including clonidine, 
moxonidine, and rilmenidine, are all ligands at alpha(2)-adrenergic and 
imidazoline (I-) receptors, the latter principally of the I1-subclass. These 
agents all lower blood pressure by reducing the activity of tonically active 
sympathoexcitatory reticulospinal neurons of the C1 area of the 
rostroventrolateral medulla (RVL). They tonically excite preganglionic 
sympathetic neurons in the spinal cord by release of L-glutamate and mediate 
most reflexes influencing blood pressure. The RVL contains alpha(2)-adrenergic 
and I1-receptors, and there is evidence to suggest that both receptors may 
participate in the hypotensive actions of the drugs. However, because only 
activation of the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors appears responsible for 
somnolence, the imidazoline-receptor agonists moxonidine and rilmenidine, both 
relatively selective for I-receptors, may have superior clinical utility in 
antihypertensive therapy, since they are sympatholytic and also suppress the 
generation of angiotensin II.
