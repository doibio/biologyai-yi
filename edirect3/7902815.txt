The effects of 6 days treatment with guanabenz, clonidine, rilmenidine and 
idazoxan on [3H]idazoxan and [3H]clonidine binding to imidazoline sites on 
rabbit kidney membranes were compared. Guanabenz and rilmenidine treatment 
resulted in a decrease in Bmax for [3H]clonidine binding and guanabenz treatment 
for [3H]idazoxan binding consistent with the compounds in vitro affinities for 
the imidazoline binding sites. [3H]Idazoxan binding was also decreased by 
idazoxan treatment suggesting that idazoxan may act as an agonist at this site. 
These results show that imidazoline sites in kidney may be modified during 
chronic drug treatment and provide further evidence for differences between the 
sites labelled by the two ligands.
