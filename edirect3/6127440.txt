1. The radioreceptor assay for S 3341, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, is based 
on the ability of the S 3341 to compete with the specific binding of [3H] 
clonidine to alpha-receptors of rat cerebral cortex membranes. The technique 
described was used for S 3341 plasma determination. 2. S 3341 levels in plasma 
and blood pressure were measured in hypertensive subjects 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24 and 
48 hours after ingestion of the drug. 3. The s 3341 plasma level rose to a 
maximum between the first and the third hours after ingestion and then declined, 
with a mean half-life of 14 hours. There were substantial inter-individual 
variations, ranging from 3 to 24 hours. 4. The fall in blood pressure mirrored 
the increase in the s 3341 plasma level during the three hours following the 
ingestion of the drug.
