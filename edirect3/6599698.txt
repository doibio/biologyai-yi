Rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep during and after continuous infusion of the 
oxazoline derivate S3341: a comparison with clonidine.

Lewis SJ, Jarrott B, Doyle AE.

The frequency and duration of rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep episodes were 
examined in normotensive rats during and after cessation of continuous infusion 
of either clonidine (10 micrograms/kg/h) or the oxazoline derivative S3341 (50 
micrograms/kg/h) for 10 days. Both compounds abolished REM-sleep during the 
infusion. On cessation of the clonidine infusion there was a rebound increase in 
the frequency and duration of REM-sleep episodes. These episodes were associated 
with markedly exaggerated blood pressure fluctuations. On cessation of the S3341 
infusion, the frequency and duration of REM-sleep episodes returned to control 
levels. Blood pressure responses were not different from controls. These 
post-infusion differences may be related to the greater degree of selectivity of 
S3341 for the alpha 2-adrenoceptor rather than the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtype.
