1. Experiments were undertaken to determine if the 
imidazoline/alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, rilmenidine, would produce mydriasis in 
cats and, if so, to delineate its site of action and determine if this effect is 
mediated by imidazoline receptors or alpha2-adrenoceptors. 2. Rilmenidine 
produced dose-related pupillary dilator responses in pentobarbital anaesthetized 
cats that were independent of sympathetic innervation to the iris but were 
dependent upon intact parasympathetic neuronal tone. The ED50 for 
rilmenidine-induced pupillary dilation was approximately 200 microg kg(-1), 
i.v., and was sustained for at least 1 h. 3. The highly selective 
alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, RS-79948, administered either before or after 
rilmenidine, antagonized rilmenidine-induced mydriasis. Neuronally induced 
reflex inhibition of parasympathetic nerve activity was also inhibited by 
administration of RS-79948. 4. These results suggest that rilmenidine acts like 
clonidine to produce pupillary dilation by inhibition of parasympathetic tone to 
the iris sphincter and that this central nervous system parasympatho-inhibition 
is mediated by alpha2-adrenoceptors, rather than imidazoline receptors.
