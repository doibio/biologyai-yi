OBJECTIVE: To determine the involvement of central imidazoline receptors in the 
cardiovascular actions of the antihypertensive agents moxonidine, rilmenidine 
and clonidine administered systemically.
DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined the relative potency of these drugs with 
respect to their effects on mean arterial pressure and heart rate by performing 
cumulative intravenous dose-response relationship studies in six conscious 
rabbits. In another eight rabbits with implanted fourth-ventricular catheters, 
we investigated the central effects of three cumulative doses of an 
l1-imidazoline/ alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, efaroxan, and of an alpha 
2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 2-methoxyidazoxan (2-Ml), on the hypotension and 
bradycardia elicited by a single intravenous dose of the above agents. The doses 
of antagonists were matched for an equal reversal of the hypotension induced by 
fourth-ventricular alpha-methyldopa (an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist) and hence 
for similar alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade.
RESULTS: Moxonidine and rilmenidine were sevenfold and eightfold less potent, 
respectively, than was clonidine in eliciting hypotension. By comparison, 
moxonidine and clonidine were more potent than was rilmenidine in producing 
bradycardia. Efaroxan and 2-Ml reversed the hypotension and bradycardia induced 
by a single dose of all three agents dose-dependently. However, efaroxan was 
more effective than was 2-Ml at reversing the effects of rilmenidine and 
moxonidine. Complete reversal of their hypotensive effect was observed with the 
highest dose of efaroxan but the highest dose of 2-Ml reversed approximately 50% 
of that effect. In contrast, the two antagonists were equally effective at 
reversing the responses to clonidine.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the hypotension and bradycardia induced 
by intravenous administration of moxonidine and rilmenidine were mediated mainly 
by actions on central imidazoline receptors whereas clonidine appears to act 
predominantly on central alpha 2-adrenoceptors.
