OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to ascertain whether rilmenidine, a second 
generation imidazoline-alpha-2-adrenoreceptor agonist, is able to increase 
analgesic effects of ibuprofen in the writhing test in mice. Experimental 
studies combining these agents have not yet been published.
METHODS: An acetic acid (0.7%) solution was injected into the peritoneal cavity 
and the number of writhes was counted. The influence on locomotor performance 
was tested using the rotarod test.
RESULTS: Rilmenidine, ibuprofen, and rilmenidine-ibuprofen fixed-ratio 
combinations produced dose-dependent antinociceptive effects. ED50 values were 
estimated for the individual drugs and an isobologram was constructed. The 
derived theoretical additive ED50 value for the rilmenidine-ibuprofen 
combination was 34.00 +/- 9.39 mg/kg. This value was significantly greater than 
the observed ED50 value which was 18.07 +/- 5.41 mg/kg, indicating a synergistic 
interaction. Rilmenidine did not impair motor coordination, as measured by the 
rotarod test, at antinociceptive and higher doses.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that rilmenidine enhances the analgesic 
activity of ibuprofen. If rilmenidine produces antinociception in humans, then 
the synergistic antinociception of rilmenidine with ibuprofen could offer 
therapeutic advantage for clinical treatment of pain.
