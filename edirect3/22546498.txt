In the present study, we investigated how increased sympathetic tone during 
middle-age affects the splenic sympathetic neurotransmission. Fifteen-month-old 
(M) F344 rats received rilmenidine (0, 0.5 or 1.5mg/kg/day, i.p. for 90 days) to 
lower sympathetic tone. Controls for age were untreated 3 or 18M rats. We report 
that rilmenidine (1) reduced plasma and splenic norepinephrine concentrations 
and splenic norepinephrine turnover, and partially reversed the sympathetic 
nerve loss; and (2) increased β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) density and 
β-AR-stimulated cAMP production. Collectively, these findings suggest a 
protective effect of lowering sympathetic tone on sympathetic nerve integrity, 
and enhanced sympathetic neurotransmission in secondary immune organs.
