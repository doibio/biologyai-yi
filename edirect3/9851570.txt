Earlier findings have shown that hypotensive effects of centrally acting drugs, 
such as clonidine, are enhanced in animals after denervation of arterial 
baroreceptors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamic of 
changes in arterial pressure, heart rate and hypotensive effects of clonidine, 
rilmenidine and moxonidine in Wistar rats after sino-aortic denervation (SAD) 
using radio-telemetry. SAD was followed by significant elevation of arterial 
pressure lability (the standard deviation of the mean arterial pressure), while 
the baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate in barodenervated rats 
(12 days after SAD) was similar to intact rats. The hypotension produced by 
clonidine, rilmenidine and moxonidine was much greater in SAD rats than in 
intact rats. The study suggests that baroreflex mechanisms are not only 
important for maintaining levels of blood pressure in the very short term, but 
also for buffering the effects of centrally acting antihypertensive drugs.
