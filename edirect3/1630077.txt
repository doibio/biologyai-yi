This review discusses the cardiovascular actions of central noradrenergic and 
serotonergic neurons, particularly with respect to the mechanism of action of 
the centrally acting antihypertensive agents clonidine, methyldopa (alpha-MD) 
and rilmenidine. The predominant actions of the noradrenergic neurons in the 
brainstem are to inhibit vasomotor and cardiac sympathetic activity and to 
facilitate cardiac vagal responses. By contrast the serotonergic neurons in the 
brainstem increase blood pressure and heart rate through excitation of cardiac 
and vasomotor sympathetic pathways and inhibition of the cardiac vagus nerve. 
The centrally acting antihypertensive drugs clonidine, rilmenidine and alpha-MD 
activate these noradrenergic pathways and inhibit the serotonergic pathways. 
Noradrenergic projections to the spinal cord tonically inhibit while the 
serotonergic neurons facilitate sympathetic vasomotor tone. In combination with 
other spinally projecting pathways, these monoamine fibers form part of a high 
gain control system for responding to changes in specific afferent information. 
However, the spinal pathways do not contribute to the actions of clonidine or 
alpha-MD. The forebrain noradrenergic projections are important for the 
noradrenergic baroreflex vagal facilitation produced by acute 6-OHDA and 
methyldopa, but not clonidine. By activating this forebrain pathway methyldopa 
minimises the baroreflex compensation that might normally be expected following 
a reduction in blood pressure.
