The aim of this study was to assess the influence of 3 hypotensive drugs on the 
metabolic disorders: dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hyperuricemia. There were 
39 patients aged 20-55, with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. The 
patients with other serious diseases or treated earlier with cholesterol or uric 
acid lowering drugs were excluded. Patients were divided into 3 groups, each was 
treated during 8 weeks with one drug: gr 1--trandolapril (T), gr 2--felodipine 
ER (F), gr 3--rilmenidine (R). Glucose and insulin in oral glucose tolerance 
test, I/G proportion, serum lipids and uric acid were tested before and after 
therapy. The therapy did not influence lipid parameters: LDL, HDL, triglyceride. 
In the T group there could be observed a significant reduction of total 
cholesterol value. Examined drugs did not induce changes in serum carbohydrate. 
The significant reduction of serum uric acid could be observed only after F 
therapy. Analysed drugs are very useful in therapy of hypertension with 
metabolic disorders.
