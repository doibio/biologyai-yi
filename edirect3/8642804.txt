Stimulation of central alpha 2-adrenoceptors has been known to prevent 
epinephrine-induced arrhythmias in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Because recent 
studies suggested that several physiological processes that were traditionally 
attributed to activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors, such as hypotensive action, 
are mediated through imidazoline receptors (IRs), it may be likely that IRs are 
involved in the antiarrhythmic action. We investigated the hypotensive effect of 
rilmenidine, a selective IR agonist (1, 3, and 10 micrograms/kg i.v.), and the 
antiarrhythmic effects of the drug on epinephrine-induced arrhythmias during 
halothane anesthesia in dogs. Although the hypotensive effect of rilmenidine was 
not remarkable in the dose range we tested, rilmenidine increased the 
arrhythmogenic threshold for epinephrine in a dose-dependent manner during 
halothane anesthesia, achieving statistical significance at 10 micrograms/kg, 
the highest dose we examined. These results suggest that rilmenidine prevents 
epinephrine-induced arrhythmias during halothane anesthesia and that this effect 
is more potent than its hypotensive action.
