AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the effect profiles of i.v. 
administered rilmenidine aimed at the same target plasma concentration, but 
attained with different rates.
METHODS: The study was placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 
double-dummy, three-way, cross-over in nine healthy volunteers. All subjects 
randomly received either a fast infusion, a slow infusion or a placebo infusion. 
The target concentration was set at 8 ng ml-1 with a fivefold difference in the 
time to reach the maximum concentration. Saccadic eye movements, 
electroencephalography (EEG), blood pressure and heart rate were measured every 
half hour. Drug plasma concentrations, adverse events, salivary flow and visual 
analogue scales were obtained every hour.
RESULTS: Changes in systolic/diastolic blood pressure at the end of the infusion 
were (mean +/- s.d.) 13.3 +/- 16.4/7.9 +/- 7.5 mmHg with the fast infusion and 
16.3 +/- 12.7/10.2 +/- 7.9 mmHg during the slow infusion, compared with 0.0 +/- 
13.2/1.3 +/- 8.3 mmHg for the placebo occasion. Decrease of saccadic peak 
velocity (SPV) at the end of the infusion was 18.0 +/- 5.2% during the fast 
infusion, 23.0 +/- 7.0% with the slow infusion, and 6.1 +/- 5.2% with placebo. 
PK/PD analysis showed similar concentration-dependent linear reduction in SPV 
and blood pressure up to the maximum observed rilmenidine plasma level for both 
the fast and the slow infusion.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of infusion of rilmenidine in healthy volunteers does not 
influence the PK/PD relationship of saccadic eye movements and blood pressure up 
to the maximum observed rilmenidine plasma concentrations. Rilmenidine causes 
clear concentration-dependent blood pressure reductions in healthy volunteers.
