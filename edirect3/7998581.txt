Rilmenidine and idazoxan reduce the volume of focal ischemic infarctions 
produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in the rat by 33% and 29%, 
respectively, by preserving neurons within the ischemic penumbra. In contrast, 
the alpha 2-selective antagonist SKF-86466 is without effect. The 
neuroprotective action of rilmenidine is dose dependent and parallels its 
antihypertensive actions. Neuroprotection cannot be attributed to changes in 
cerebral blood flow. We conclude that the neuroprotection produced by 
rilmenidine is attributable to an interaction with imidazoline receptors (IRs). 
However, the mechanism of action is not obvious. If it results from an action 
within the penumbra (direct), it is mediated by mitochondrial I-2 receptors on 
astrocytes, since cortical neurons are devoid of IRs. Neuroprotection might 
occur by selectively stimulating Ca2+ uptake into astrocytes, and thereby 
reducing Ca2+ uptake into neurons. Alternatively, rilmenidine may act indirectly 
to activate pathways in the brain that are neuroprotective. Neuroprotection may 
be a therapeutic target for rilmenidine and allied agents that act at central 
IRs.
