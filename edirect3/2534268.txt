The hypertensive heart is an example of myocardial adaptation to a chronic 
mechanical overload. In this model, the myocardium adapts by quantitative 
mechanisms such as hypertrophy and by qualitative processes at sarcomere and 
cell membrane level. Cardiac failure occurs when these mechanisms become 
inadequate although other phenomena such as collagen, coronary resistances, 
adverse hormonal effects and associated pathologies also play a role. This 
report describes an experimental model: uninephrectomised rats were made 
hypertensive by administering a DOCA-salt diet. The resulting cardiac 
hypertrophy was reduced and the hypertension corrected by propranolol. 
Rilmenidine, a new antihypertensive agent, has no effect on cardiac hypertrophy 
but it does reduce myocardial collagen concentrations significantly which has 
potentially important beneficial consequences.
