The effects of imidazolines and derivatives were studied on insulin secretion 
and vascular resistance in the isolated perfused rat pancreas. On insulin 
secretion, two imidazoline alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, efaroxan (1-100 
microM) and RX821002 (10 microM), had a stimulating response; however, idazoxan, 
like the non-imidazoline alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, was 
ineffective at 10 microM. The oxazoline rilmenidine with alpha 2-adrenergic 
activity at 10 microM), an imidazoline devoid of alpha 2-adrenergic activity, 
also had an insulin-releasing effect. On pancreatic vessels, all imidazolines 
tested (efaroxan, RX821002, antazoline and idazoxan), in contrast to yohimbine, 
induced vasoconstriction. Rilmenidine did not have a vasoconstrictor effect 
after blockade of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, the efaroxan-induced 
insulin release or vasoconstriction was not affected by the blockade of alpha 2- 
and alpha 1-adrenoceptors. This study shows that imidazolines and derivatives 
are able to stimulate insulin release and induce vasoconstriction in the rat 
pancreas. These effects cannot be ascribed to an interaction with 
alpha-adrenoceptors but may involve different types of imidazoline sites.
