The function of presynaptic imidazoline-1 receptors (I1-R) in the heart remains 
unclear. In rat hearts, UK14.304 and moxonidine reduced norepinephrine (NE) 
release. AGN192403 had no influence on NE, whereas rilmenidine, agmatine, 
rauwolscine, and efaroxan increased NE. These effects of moxonidine and 
rilmenidine were not affected by AGN192403 adminstration. Conversely, after 
pretreatment with UK14.304, only moxonidine displayed a pronounced inhibitory 
action on NE release (sensitive to AGN192403), indicating a synergistic 
inhibitory action at I1-R under conditions of a stimulated alpha2-adrenergic 
autoinhibition.
