Imidazoline I1 receptor signaling is associated with pathways that regulate cell 
viability leading to varied cell-type specific phenotypes. We demonstrated that 
the antihypertensive drug rilmenidine, a selective imidazoline I1 receptor 
agonist, modulates proliferation and stimulates the proapoptotic protein Bax 
thus inducing the perturbation of the mitochondrial pathway and apoptosis in 
human leukemic K562 cells. Rilmenidine acts through a mechanism which involves 
deactivation of Ras/MAP kinases ERK, p38 and JNK. Moreover, rilmenidine renders 
K562 cells, which are particularly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, 
susceptible to the DNA damaging drug doxorubicin. The rilmenidine co-treatment 
with doxorubicin reverses G2/M arrest and triggers apoptotic response to DNA 
damage. Our data offer new insights into the pathways associated with 
imidazoline I1 receptor activation in K562 cells suggesting rilmenidine as a 
valuable tool to deepen our understanding of imidazoline I1 receptor signaling 
in hematologic malignancies and to search for medicinally active agents.
