CONTEXT: Despite the constant enrichment of the pharmacopoeia, the normalizing 
of blood pressure in hypertensive diabetic patients remains difficult.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of rilmenidine in first 
intention in hypertensive diabetics.
METHODS: In a population of 18 235 hypertensive patients, the sub-population of 
diabetic patients was followed-up in an open study over one year. These patients 
were initially treated with 1 mg/day of rilmenidine with the possibility of 
adapting the dose - increasing to 2 mg/d and association with a second or even 
third anti-hypertensor, left to the discretion of the physician - when the 
diastolic blood pressure remained strictly greater than 90 mmHg.
RESULTS: The complete blood pressure data over a period of 12 months were 
obtained in 2 311 patients out of 2 738 (84.4%). After 12 months' treatment, 
75.9% of the 2 311 patients were normalized by the monotherapy with rilmenidine 
(diastolic blood pressure<90 mmHg according to the recommendations in force at 
the time of the study). The clinical acceptability was good and comparable to 
that obtained in the general population of 18 235 hypertensive patients. The 
biological parameters remained stable.
CONCLUSION: This pharmaco-epidemiological assessment demonstrates, in conditions 
of current practice, the anti-hypertensive efficacy and acceptability of 
rilmenidine in hypertensive diabetics, therefore confirming its place in the 
therapeutic arsenal of these patients.
