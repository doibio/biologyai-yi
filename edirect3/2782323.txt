Rilmenidine is a novel antihypertensive agent related to alpha 2-adrenoceptor 
agonist, used in the treatment of mild or moderate hypertension at the oral dose 
of 1 mg once a day or 1 mg twice a day. The pharmacokinetic parameters were 
investigated after single or repeated administration in healthy subjects, using 
labeled and unlabeled compounds. Rilmenidine was rapidly and extensively 
absorbed, with an absolute bioavailability close to one and a time to peak 
plasma concentration of two hours. Rilmenidine was not subjected to presystemic 
metabolism. Distribution was independent of the free fraction since rilmenidine 
was weakly bound to plasma proteins (less than 10 percent). The volume of 
distribution was approximately 5 liters/kg (315 liters). Elimination was rapid, 
with a total body plasma clearance of approximately 450 ml/minute and an 
elimination half-life of approximately eight hours. Renal excretion was the 
major elimination process (two thirds of the total clearance); the parent drug 
in urine accounted for about 65 percent of the dose administered. Metabolism was 
very poor; few metabolites were found in urine and no metabolites were detected 
in plasma. Linear pharmacokinetics was demonstrated for rilmenidine from 0.5 to 
2 mg; at 3 mg, a slight deviation from linearity was observed. In repeated 
administration, the linearity with dose of the pharmacokinetics of rilmenidine 
was confirmed.
