The actions of the imidazoline derivatives clonidine, moxonidine, and 
rilmenidine and of the recently discovered clonidine-displacing substance 
agmatine on stimulation-induced norepinephrine overflow and epinephrine release 
were studied in pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats. All three imidazolines 
dose-dependently decreased norepinephrine overflow and led to an increase in 
epinephrine release when the highest dose of each compound was injected. The 
alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine shifted the dose-response curves of 
plasma norepinephrine concentrations to higher levels. Agmatine did not change 
norepinephrine overflow but increased epinephrine release into plasma after the 
highest dose administered. It is concluded that the investigated imidazolines 
decrease norepinephrine overflow via presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors, whereas 
epinephrine release is mediated through putative imidazoline receptors on the 
adrenal medulla.
