Alpha 2 agonists including rilmenidine, clonidine and alpha methylnoradrenaline 
all seem to have a predominantly central action in lowering blood pressure. 
Studies using the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor alpha-methyldopa hydrazine 
in both experimental animals and humans support the predominant central action 
of the active metabolite of methyldopa, alpha methylnoradrenaline. Comparative 
studies on the antihypertensive potency of selective alpha 2 agonists like 
rilmenidine, guanfacine, clonidine and lofexidine suggest that the relative 
ability to bind to alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenoceptors is not critical but the 
ability to enter the central nervous system is essential for antihypertensive 
efficacy.
