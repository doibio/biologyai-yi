Ten patients (44 y), 6 with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and none with 
hypertensive disease, underwent electrophysiological studies before and after 
intravenous infusion of a single dose of 1 mg rilmenidine administered over 15 
min. The regimen produced a mean plasma rilmenidine concentration of 3.16 
ng.ml-1 at the end of the infusion. There was no significant change in sinus 
cycle length, PR interval, QRS, QT duration or in PA, AH and HV intervals. 
Estimated sinoatrial conduction time and corrected sinus node recovery time did 
not significantly change. In one patient, however, an abnormal pause was noted 
after termination of rapid atrial pacing. The right atrial effective refractory 
period decreased from 209 to 194 ms. There was no significant change in the 
anterograde and retrograde block cycle length or in the refractoriness of the 
nodal, ventricular and accessory pathways. The cycle length of induced 
reciprocating tachycardia decreased slightly from 374 to 351 ms. No patient 
exhibited an abnormal response to the carotid sinus massage. The findings 
indicate that intravenous administration of 1 mg rilmenidine exerts modest 
effects on the electrophysiological parameters of the human heart.
