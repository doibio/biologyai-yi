rat drug discrimination paradigm.

Clonidine produces an interoceptive discriminative stimulus or "cue" in rat drug 
discrimination studies. This cue may be mediated by its alpha-2 adrenoceptor 
agonist properties and/or its affinity for the non-adrenoceptor imidazoline 
preferring receptor. Six rats were trained to respond differentially after 
receiving clonidine (0.02 mg kg-1, IP) or a saline vehicle. The alpha-2 
adrenoceptor agonists clonidine, UK14, 304 and rilmenidine, which bind to the 
imidazoline preferring receptor, and guanabenz which does not, dose-dependently 
substituted for (i.e. > 80% total responding was clonidine associated) the 
clonidine-induced cue in doses up to 0.02, 0.16, 1.25 and 0.32 mg kg-1, 
respectively. Furthermore, the cue was blocked when clonidine was given in 
combination with 30-min pretreatments of the highly selective alpha-2 
adrenoceptor antagonists RX811059 (2.5 mg kg-1) and fluparoxan (3 mg kg-1). 
Since the clonidine-induced cue was substituted for by guanabenz, which does not 
act at the imidazoline-preferring receptor, and antagonised by RX811059 and 
fluparoxan it appears to be mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Moreover, 
abolition of the clonidine-induced cue did not occur with the peripherally 
acting alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist L659, 066 suggesting it involves central 
as opposed to peripheral sites.
