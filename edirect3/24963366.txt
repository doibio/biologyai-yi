BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the effects of treatment with chronic 
antihypertensive drugs (clonidine, methyldopa, amlodipine, ramipril and 
rilmenidine) on oxidant-antioxidant parameters and toxic effects on DNA in rat 
uterus tissue. In addition, uterus tissues were examined histopathologically.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 albino Wistar rats were divided into the 
following six groups: 0.075 mg/kg clonidine group; 100 mg/kg methyldopa group; 2 
mg/kg amlodipine group; 2.5 mg/kg ramipril group; 0.5 mg/kg rilmenidine group; 
and the healthy group. Rats underwent chronic drug administration for 30 days 
and at the end, biochemical and histopathological examinations were performed. 
All data were subjected to one-way ANOVA test.
RESULTS: We divided these drugs into the following three groups according to 
their effects on rat uteri: (I) mild negative effects (clonidine), (II) moderate 
negative effects (rilmenidine, methyldopa) and (III) drugs which had severe 
negative effects (amlodipine, ramipril).
CONCLUSION: These data may help with selection of antihypertensive drugs, in 
order to determine which drugs have the lowest toxicity in pregnant and 
non-pregnant (pre-pregnancy) women.
