Clonidine, guanfacine, guanabenz and alpha-methyl-dioxyphenylalanine (DOPA), the 
prototypes of centrally acting antihypertensives, are assumed to induce 
peripheral sympathoinhibition and a reduction in blood pressure via the 
stimulation of alpha2-adrenoceptors in the brain stem. More recently, central 
imidazoline (I1)-receptors have been recognized to be another target of 
centrally acting antihypertensive drugs. Clonidine is considered to be a mixed 
agonist that stimulates both alpha2- and I1-receptors. Moxonidine and 
rilmenidine are considered to be moderately selective I1-receptor stimulants, 
although it still remains unknown whether these agents act directly on the 
receptor as genuine agonists. A survey is given on the location, characteristics 
and functional aspects of imidazoline I1-receptors as targets of centrally 
acting antihypertensives. Furthermore, the pharmacology and clinical potential 
of selective I1-receptor agonists such as moxonidine and rilmenidine are 
discussed. Although far from perfect, these compounds have shown that it may 
potentially be possible to develop agents with which the well-known side effects 
caused by alpha2-receptor agonists can be separated from the central 
antihypertensive mechanism.
