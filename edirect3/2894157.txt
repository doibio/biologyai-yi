This study compares the effects of 2 alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, rilmenidine (S 
3341) and clonidine, on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction (HIB) in guinea 
pigs. Clonidine has previously been shown to potentiate HIB in guinea pigs. The 
study was conducted in anesthetized, paralyzed and ventilated guinea pigs. Six 
groups of at least 6 guinea pigs were pretreated with saline, rilmenidine (0.1, 
0.3 and 1 mg/kg intravenously) or clonidine (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg intravenously), 
respectively. Conductance, dynamic compliance and static compliance of the 
respiratory system were measured before and during histamine infusion (80 
ng/kg/s) and expressed as percent variation. Clonidine potentiated HIB as 
previously reported. In contrast, rilmenidine potentiated HIB only at the dose 
of 1 mg/kg. As it is well known that HIB is influenced by adrenergic outflow, 
these results suggest that rilmenidine has less inhibitory effect than clonidine 
on adrenal secretion.
