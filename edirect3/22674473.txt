Imidazoline I1-receptors (I1R) are known to regulate blood pressure and 
rilmenidine, an agonist, is widely used as antihypertensive agent in clinic. 
However, the role of I1R in feeding behavior is still unclear. In the present 
study, we used the agonist of I1R to investigate the effect on hyperphagia in 
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Rilmenidine decreased the food 
intake of STZ-diabetic mice in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction of food 
intake was abolished by pretreatment with efaroxan at the dose sufficient to 
block I1R. Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of rilmenidine into 
STZ-diabetic mice also significantly reduced hyperphagia, which was reversed by 
icv administration of efaroxan. In addition, similar results were observed in 
STZ-diabetic mice, which received chronic treatment with rilmenidine 3 times 
daily (t.i.d.) for 7 days. Moreover, the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) level 
was reduced by rilmenidine that was also reversed by pretreatment with efaroxan. 
In conclusion, the obtained results suggest that rilmenidine can decrease food 
intake in STZ-diabetic mice through an activation of I1R to lower hypothalamic 
NPY level.
