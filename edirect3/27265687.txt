The clonidine-like central antihypertensive agent rilmenidine, which has high 
affinity for I1-type imidazoline receptors (I1-IR) was recently found to have 
cytotoxic effects on cultured cancer cell lines. However, due to its 
pharmacological effects resulting also from α2-adrenoceptor activation, 
rilmenidine cannot be considered a suitable anticancer drug candidate. Here, we 
report the identification of novel rilmenidine-derived compounds with anticancer 
potential and devoid of α2-adrenoceptor effects by means of ligand- and 
structure-based drug design approaches. Starting from a large virtual library, 
eleven compounds were selected, synthesized and submitted to biological 
evaluation. The most active compound 5 exhibited a cytotoxic profile similar to 
that of rilmenidine, but without appreciable affinity to α2-adrenoceptors. In 
addition, compound 5 significantly enhanced the apoptotic response to 
doxorubicin, and may thus represent an important tool for the development of 
better adjuvant chemotherapeutic strategies for doxorubicin-insensitive cancers.
