BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently 
present comorbidities that put them at risk of polypharmacy and 
medication-related problems. This study aims to describe the overall medication 
profile of patients aged ≥75 years with advanced CKD from a multicenter French 
study and specifically the renally (RIMs) and potentially 
inappropriate-for-the-elderly medications (PIMs) that they take.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of medication profiles of 
individuals aged ≥75 years with eGFR < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 followed by a 
nephrologist, who collected their active prescriptions at the study inclusion 
visit. Medication profiles were first analyzed according to route of 
administration, therapeutic classification. Second, patients were classified 
according to their risk of potential medication-related problems, based on 
whether the prescription was a RIM or a PIM. RIMs and PIMs have been defined 
according to renal appropriateness guidelines and to Beer's criteria in the 
elderly. RIMs were subclassified by 4 types of category: (a) contraindication; 
(b) dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance (CrCl); (c) 
dose modification based on CrCl is not recommended but a maximum daily dose is 
mentioned, (d) no specific recommendations based on CrCl: "use with caution", 
"avoid in severe impairment", "careful monitoring of dose is required" "reduce 
the dose".
RESULTS: We collected 5196 individual medication prescriptions for 556 patients, 
for a median of 9 daily medications [7-11]. Antihypertensive agents, 
antithrombotics, and antianemics were the classes most frequently prescribed. 
Moreover, 77.0% of patients had at least 1 medication classified as a RIM. They 
accounted 31.3% of the drugs prescribed and 9.25% was contraindicated drugs. At 
least 1 PIM was taken by 57.6 and 45.5% of patients had at least one medication 
classified as RIM and PIM. The prescriptions most frequently requiring 
reassessment due to potential adverse effects were for proton pump inhibitors 
and allopurinol. The PIMs for which deprescription is especially important in 
this population are rilmenidine, long-term benzodiazepines, and anticholinergic 
drugs such as hydroxyzine.
CONCLUSION: We showed potential drug-related problems in elderly patients with 
advanced CKD. Healthcare providers must reassess each medication prescribed for 
this population, particularly the specific medications identified here.
