1. The cardiac vagal effects of rilmenidine (5 micrograms kg-1 min-1) and 
clonidine (0.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1) were studied in chloralose anaesthetized 
dogs. 2. Rilmenidine and clonidine progressively reduced the vagal 
stimulation-induced bradycardia. As indicated by the ED70, rilmenidine was about 
23 times less potent than clonidine in this respect. Concomitantly, both drugs 
dose-relatedly decreased heart rate and mean blood pressure with potency ratios 
of rilmenidne to clonidine of about 1:23 and 1:12, respectively. 3. Importantly, 
the heart rate values observed under vagal stimulation during drug infusion 
never exceeded the values under basal vagal stimulation, and with both drugs 
large interindividual variations occurred under vagal stimulation. 4. These 
results show that the vagal bradycardia inhibition produced by rilmenidine and 
clonidine results from their true bradycardic effects and not from actual 
cardiac vagolytic properties.
