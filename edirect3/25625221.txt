Harmane is an active component of clonidine displacing substance and a candidate 
endogenous ligand for imidazoline binding sites. The neurochemistry of tritiated 
harmane was investigated in the present study examining its uptake and release 
properties in the rat brain central nervous system (CNS) in vitro. At 
physiological temperature, [(3)H]harmane was shown to be taken up in rat brain 
cortex. Further investigations demonstrated that treatment with monoamine uptake 
blockers (citalopram, nomifensine and nisoxetine) did not alter [(3)H]harmane 
uptake implicating that the route of [(3)H]harmane transport was distinct from 
the monoamine uptake systems. Furthermore, imidazoline ligands (rilmenidine, 
efaroxan, 2-BFI and idazoxan) showed no prominent effect on [(3)H]harmane uptake 
suggesting the lack of involvement of imidazoline binding sites. Subsequent 
analyses showed that disruption of the Na(+) gradient using ouabain or choline 
chloride did not block [(3)H]harmane uptake suggesting a Na(+)-independent 
transport mechanism. Moreover, higher temperatures (50°C) failed to impede 
[(3)H]harmane uptake implying a non-physiological transporter. The failure of 
potassium to evoke the release of preloaded [(3)H]harmane from rat brain cortex 
indicates that the properties of this putative endogenous ligand for imidazoline 
binding sites do not resemble that of a conventional neurotransmitter.
