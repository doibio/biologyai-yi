The aim of the study was to ascertain antinociceptive effects of rilmenidine, a 
second-generation imidazoline-alpha-2-adrenoreceptor agonist, and to see whether 
rilmenidine was able to increase the analgesic effects of paracetamol in the 
writhing test in mice. An acetic acid (0.7%) solution was injected into the 
peritoneal cavity and the number of writhes was counted. The influence on 
locomotor performance was tested using the rotarod test. Rilmenidine, 
paracetamol, and rilmenidine-paracetamol fixed-ratio combinations produced 
dose-dependent antinociceptive effects. ED(50) values were estimated for the 
individual drugs and an isobologram was constructed. The derived theoretical 
additive ED(50) value for the rilmenidine-paracetamol combination was 109.23 +/- 
35.05 mg/kg. This value was significantly greater than the observed ED(50) value 
which was 56.35 +/- 20.86 mg/kg, indicating a synergistic interaction. 
Rilmenidine did not impair motor coordination, as measured by the rotarod test, 
at antinociceptive and higher doses.
