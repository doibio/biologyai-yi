Rabbits were treated with intravenous clonidine (8 mumol kg-1 day-1), guanabenz 
(20 mumol kg-1 day-1), rilmenidine (80 mumol kg-1 day-1) or vehicle via osmotic 
minipumps. After 6 days treatment mean arterial pressure (MAP), pressor 
responses to intravenous alpha-methyl noradrenaline and depressor responses to 
intracisternal clonidine were studied, and [3H]-yohimbine binding to forebrain 
and hindbrain examined in vitro. Clonidine, guanabenz and rilmenidine had 
similar effects on MAP and caused a similar attenuation of the depressor 
response to intracisternal clonidine, but only guanabenz attenuated pressor 
responses to intravenous alpha-methyl noradrenaline. Rilmenidine had no effect 
on [3H]-yohimbine binding to brain membranes. Clonidine treatment decreased 
binding in hindbrain while guanabenz treatment decreased binding in both fore- 
and hindbrain. Thus, the depressor effects of chronic treatment did not 
correlate with the effects on [3H]-yohimbine binding sites in rabbit brain 
suggesting that the blood pressure lowering effects of many centrally acting 
antihypertensive drugs are not necessarily dependent on binding to the alpha 
2-adrenoceptor site labelled by [3H]-yohimbine.
