Clonidine, moxonidine, and rilmenidine are centrally acting antihypertensive 
agents that lower arterial pressure by inhibiting the tonic activity of 
sympathoexcitatory neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Competing 
hypotheses have been put forward by different investigators to explain the 
sympathoinhibition evoked by "imidazoline drugs": either via central actions at 
alpha 2-adrenergic receptors or novel I1-imidazoline receptors. These different 
perspectives are presented in the accompanying reviews.
