Administration (3 to 100 microg/kg IV) of clonidine, rilmenidine, and an 
imidazoline derivative, 2-(2-chlorophenylamino)imidazoline, in pithed 
nonstimulated rabbits caused a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure 
without affecting heart rate. Prazosin (0.1 mg/kg IV) almost abolished the 
pressor responses to 2-(2-chlorophenylamino)imidazoline, partially inhibited 
those induced by clonidine, but failed to affect those elicited by rilmenidine. 
In contrast, yohimbine (1 mg/kg IV) blunted the pressor responses of the 3 
drugs. In sympathetically stimulated pithed rabbits, 
2-(2-chlorophenylamino)imidazoline induced only pressor effects, whereas 
clonidine and rilmenidine caused a transient pressure increase followed by a 
dose-dependent depressor effect. Yohimbine abolished the depressor effect of 
both drugs, which may have involved presynaptic alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. In 
conclusion, peripheral effects of 2-(2-chlorophenylamino)imidazoline and 
clonidine involved at least alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor activation, 
whereas pressor and depressor effects of rilmenidine were mediated by 
alpha(2)-adrenoceptors.
