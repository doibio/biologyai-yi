Autophagy is a degradation pathway for long-lived cytoplasmic proteins, protein 
complexes, or damaged organelles. The accumulation and aggregation of misfolded 
proteins are hallmarks of several neurodegenerative diseases. Many researchers 
have reported that autophagy degrades disease-causing misfolded and aggregated 
proteins, including mutant huntingtin (Htt) in Huntington's disease, mutant 
synuclein in familial Parkingson's disease, mutant Cu, Zn-Superoxide dismutase 
(SOD1) in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we will bring 
up new evidence to elucidate the involvement of autophagy in degradation of 
mutant Htt, discuss the mechanisms regulating the degradation of mutant Htt by 
autophagy and the therapeutic effects of drugs that enhance autophagy to improve 
clearance of mutant Htt. We propose that enhancement of autophagy by drugs may 
be a strategy to treat or retard progression of Huntington's disease.
