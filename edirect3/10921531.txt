Hypertension is a frequent complication in diabetes, and microalbuminuria has 
become an essential index of cardiovascular prognosis in type 2 diabetics. The 
pilot study reported here shows that rilmenidine, in addition to its 
antihypertensive action and good clinical tolerability, has the further 
advantage of reducing microalbuminuria, similar to captopril.
