It was long thought that the prototypical centrally acting antihypertensive drug 
clonidine lowers sympathetic tone by activating alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in the 
brain stem. Supported by the development of two new centrally acting drugs, 
rilmenidine and moxonidine, the imidazoline hypothesis evolved recently. It 
assumes the existence of a new group of receptors, the imidazoline receptors, 
and attributes the sympathoinhibition to activation of I(1) imidazoline 
receptors in the medulla oblongata. This review analyzes the mechanism of action 
of clonidine-like drugs, with special attention given to the imidazoline 
hypothesis. Two conclusions are drawn. The first is that the arguments against 
the imidazoline hypothesis outweigh the observations that support it and that 
the sympathoinhibitory effects of clonidine-like drugs are best explained by 
activation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. The second conclusion is that this class 
of drugs lowers sympathetic tone not only by a primary action in cardiovascular 
regulatory centres in the medulla oblongata. Peripheral presynaptic inhibition 
of transmitter release from postganglionic sympathetic neurons contributes to 
the overall sympathoinhibition.
