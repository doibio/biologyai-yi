OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of imidazoline receptors and 
alpha2-adrenoceptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) on the renal 
sympathetic baroreflex.
METHODS: The effects of rilmenidine (4 nmol) and alpha-methylnoradrenaline 
(alpha-MNA, 80 nmol) micro-injected into the RVLM of urethane-anaesthetized 
rabbits previously implanted with renal nerve recording electrodes were examined 
before and after micro-injection of the imidazoline receptor/alpha2-adrenoceptor 
antagonist idazoxan and the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist 2-methoxyidazoxan 
(2-MI).
RESULTS: Rilmenidine and alpha-MNA both lowered mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 
28% and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) by 35%, and reduced RSNA upper 
plateaus and ranges by 30-70%. Rilmenidine decreased both sympathetic burst 
frequency and amplitude while alpha-MNA reduced amplitude only. Rilmenidine 
shifted the RSNA baroreflex curve to the left while alpha-MNA shifted the curve 
to the right Idazoxan (13 nmol) reversed the hypotension and all RSNA effects of 
rilmenidine, while 2-MI (4 nmol) increased MAP 18% above the control and also 
reversed all RSNA parameters. By contrast, 2-MI reversed the alpha-MNA-induced 
hypotension and partially restored RSNA and the upper plateau of the RSNA 
baroreflex curve. Idazoxan treatment only partially reversed the hypotension 
after alpha-MNA and had no effect on any of the baroreflex curves.
CONCLUSION: Both alpha-MNA and rilmenidine injected into the RVLM of rabbits 
produce renal sympathetic inhibition, but differences in the location of the 
baroreflex curve and the pattern of effects on burst amplitude and frequency 
suggest different mechanisms of action. The effects of idazoxan suggest that 
rilmenidine acts via imidazoline receptors. Since 2-MI reversed the actions of 
alpha-MNA and also rilmenidine, this suggests that alpha2-adrenoceptor 
hypotension can be produced in the rabbit RVLM and that rilmenidine may activate 
alpha2-adrenoceptors, possibly as a result of activating imidazoline receptors.
