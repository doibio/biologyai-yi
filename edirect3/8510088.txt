Clinical and renal haemodynamic parameters were evaluated in 20 mild 
hypertensive patients after rilmenidine (RIL) administration during a one month 
double-blind randomised study compared with hydrochlorothiazide (HCT). At the 
beginning and at the end of the study, BP, heart rate and renal haemodynamic 
parameters were evaluated. Renal haemodynamic parameters included effective 
renal plasma flow (ERPF) evaluated by radionuclide study utilising 131I-Hippuran 
according to Schlegel's method, effective renal blood flow (ERBF = ERPF/(1-Ht)), 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by creatinine clearance, filtration fraction 
(FF = GFR/ERPF) and renal vascular resistances (RVR = DBP x 80/ERBF). RIL and 
HCT significantly (P < 0.01) reduced systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure 
without relevant change in ERPF, ERBF, GFR and FF. RVR was significantly reduced 
both in the RIL group (P < 0.002 vs. baseline) and in the HCT group (P < 0.001 
vs. baseline). No relevant side-effects were observed in either group. In 
conclusion, rilmenidine was effective in reducing BP in mild hypertensive 
patients and produced favourable effects on renal function.
