The prejunctional activities of S-3341 and clonidine have been studied in the 
transmural field-stimulated epididymal part of the rat vas deferens. Both S-3341 
and clonidine inhibited these neuronally induced contractions. At high 
concentrations, these agonists induced spontaneous contractions in the 
preparation, which were abolished by 10(-7) M prazosin. The inhibitory effects 
of S-3341 and clonidine were antagonized in a competitive manner by rauwolscine 
and were found not to be modified in a statistically significant manner by 
10(-7) M prazosin. The pA2 values of rauwolscine against S-3341 and clonidine 
were the same, indicating the receptors influenced by these drugs were the same 
also. However, the efficacy of S-3341 is lower than that of clonidine (by a 
factor of approximately 100). This lower efficacy of S-3341 at the prejunctional 
level could be linked to the lack of a sedative effect of this compound at 
therapeutic concentrations.
