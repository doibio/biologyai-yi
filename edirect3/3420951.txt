1. Adult rat hepatocytes co-cultured with rat liver epithelial cells were used 
to evaluate chronic cytotoxicity of a new alpha 2 agonist, oxaminozoline 
(S-3341-3) compared to that of clonidine. The same maximum non-toxic 
concentration (25 micrograms per ml of medium) was found for both drugs after a 
daily treatment for 12 days. 2. Oxaminozoline metabolism was analysed in 
short-term hepatocyte cultures. Four metabolites resulting from oxidation or 
hydrolysis of the parent drug were identified. Three of the metabolites were 
identical to those reported in vivo. The presence of an additional minor 
metabolite in culture may be due to the higher metabolic rate of the drug in 
this model system.
