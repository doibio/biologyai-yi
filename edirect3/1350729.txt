The binding of [3H]rilmenidine to membranes of rat cerebral cortex was studied 
in order to ascertain which receptor populations this novel antihypertensive 
interacts with in the cortex. A catecholamine-sensitive, alpha 2-adrenoceptor 
binding site was identified which represented up to 50% of specific, 2 nmol/L 
[3H]rilmenidine binding and was displaceable by the catecholamines in the rank 
order epinephrine----norepinephrine----dopamine----isoproterenol. Some 
imidazolines such as clonidine, naphazoline, and idazoxan and the guanidino 
compound guanabenz completely and potently inhibited [3H]rilmenidine binding 
from both catecholamine-sensitive and -insensitive sites. The substituted 
imidazole and guanidine, cimetidine, and amiloride, respectively, showed no 
affinity for [3H]rilmenidine binding. The pharmacologic profile of the 
catecholamine-insensitive [3H]rilmenidine site in rat cerebral cortex suggests 
it may be novel, as it has the features of an imidazoline-guanidino-oxazoline 
binding site. However, its identity requires further characterization.
