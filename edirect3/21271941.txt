OBJECTIVE: In this study, effects of chronic antihypertensive drug (clonidine, 
methyldopa, amlodipine, ramipril, and rilmenidine) treatment on 
antioxidant-oxidant parameters were investigated in rat ovarian tissue.
STUDY DESIGN: Chronic drug administration for 30 days and at the end, 
biochemical examinations (total glutathione (tGSH), glutathione peroxidase 
(GPO), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione s-transferase (GST), superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) analyses) were performed.
RESULTS: The levels of glutathione (GSH) and NO, and the activities of GPO, GR, 
GST, SOD, and CAT were measured the lowest in ramiprile group. Also in ramiprile 
group, the level of MDA and the activity of MPO was the highest.
CONCLUSION: We divided the drugs into four groups according to their biochemical 
side effect potentials in ovarian tissue: (I) Drugs which have no clear negative 
effect on ovarian tissue: clonidine, rilmenidine; (II) Drugs which have mild 
negative effect on ovarian tissue: methyldopa; (III) Drugs which have moderate 
negative effect on ovarian tissue: amlodipine; (IV) Drugs which have severe 
negative effect on ovarian tissue: ramipril. These data might be useful in the 
selection of the least toxic antihypertensive drug in pregnant and/or normal 
females.
