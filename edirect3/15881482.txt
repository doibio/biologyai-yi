OBJECTIVE: In previous studies, the I1 imidazoline specific agonist rilmenidine 
effectively lowered office blood pressure (BP) in patients with metabolic 
syndrome, improved glucose metabolism and did not demonstrate unfavourable 
effects on plasma lipids. The aim of the present study was to investigate the 
effects of 12weeks therapy with rilmenidine compared with the ACE inhibitor 
lisinopril on ambulatory BP, plasma lipid and fasting glucose levels in women 
with metabolic syndrome.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Prospective randomised open-label, blinded end-points study.
METHODS: Female patients (n = 51) with hypertension and other components of 
metabolic syndrome were treated with 1 mg rilmenidine (n = 24) or 10 mg 
lisinopril (n = 27), once- or twice-daily. Anthropometric measurements, office 
BP and heart rate (HR) measurements, ambulatory BP monitoring, lipid and fasting 
glucose assessment were performed before and after 12weeks of treatment
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in ambulatory BP and HR, including 24-h, daytime 
and night-time values, and in lipids and glucose levels. All changes were 
adjusted for baseline values using the analysis of covariance method.
RESULTS: Ambulatory 24-h systolic BP and diastolic BP were decreased 
significantly in the rilmenidine group (-11.9 +/- 1.9 and -7.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, p 
< 0.001) respectively and the lisinopril group (-11.0 +/- 1.8 and -6.7 +/- 0.7 
mm Hg respectively, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between 
the two groups. Rilmenidine reduced 24-h ambulatory HR (-3.6 +/- 0.8 bpm versus 
0.3 +/- 0.8 bpm with lisinopril; p = 0.002). The reductions of day-time and 
night-time BP were also significant for both treatment groups, but the 
rilmenidine group demonstrated a greater decrease in night-time diastolic BP (p 
= 0.046). Rilmenidine significantly increased HDL cholesterol and decreased 
fasting glucose levels (p = 0.009 and p = 0.012, respectively). HDL cholesterol 
tended to increase and fasting glucose tended to decrease in the lisinopril 
group. However, differences between groups were not significant.
CONCLUSION: Rilmenidine has similar effects on ambulatory BP patterns in 
hypertensive women with metabolic syndrome as lisinopril. Rilmenidine compared 
with lisinopril significantly reduces ambulatory HR. In this study, rilmenidine 
and lisinopril demonstrate similar effects on plasma lipid and fasting glucose 
levels.
