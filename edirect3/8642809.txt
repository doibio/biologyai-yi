In the present study, we investigated the renal actions of two compounds 
reported to interact with the imidazoline receptor: rilmenidine (I1-receptor 
selective, centrally acting antihypertensive) and agmatine (an endogenous 
clonidine-displacing substance). Rilmenidine (saline vehicle, 3 or 30 
nmol/kg/min) or agmatine (saline vehicle, 3 or 30 nmol/kg/min) was infused 
directly into the renal artery of anesthetized (pentobarbitone) Sprague-Dawley 
rats (280-300 g) that had undergone a unilateral nephrectomy 7 to 10 days before 
the experiment. Rilmenidine produced an increase in urine flow rate at doses 
that failed to significantly alter blood pressure, creatinine clearance, or 
heart rate. The increase in urine flow rate was secondary to an increase in 
osmolar clearance, primarily composed of sodium. Free water clearance was not 
altered at these infusion rates. Agmatine also increased urine flow rate at 
doses that failed to alter blood pressure, creatinine clearance, and heart rate. 
The increase in urine flow rate was secondary to an increase in osmolar 
clearance, again primarily composed of sodium. The natriuretic action of 
rilmenidine and agmatine, at doses that do not lower blood pressure acutely, 
could be beneficial in the antihypertensive actions of these centrally acting 
agents.
