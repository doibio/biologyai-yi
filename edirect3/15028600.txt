At the alpha(2A)-autoreceptors on the sympathetic nerve terminals of the human 
atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary artery, rilmenidine and oxymetazoline 
exhibit different properties (antagonism and agonism, respectively). These 
opposite pharmacodynamic properties of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor ligands seem to be 
due to substantial differences in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences 
between human and rabbit alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors. Hence, the rabbit 
alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor is not reliably predictive for the action of ligands at 
the human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor.
