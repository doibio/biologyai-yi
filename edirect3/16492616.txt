OBJECTIVES: A prospective, open-labeled study to assess the antihypertensive 
effect of monotherapy with rilmenidine and its impact on quality of life (QoL), 
as well as on biochemical parameters in perimenopausal women with essential 
hypertension.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-five perimenopausal women with mild to moderate 
essential hypertension (mean age 51.4+/-2.4 years) were enrolled. At baseline 
and after 12-week monotherapy with rilmenidine, we assessed: systolic (SBP) and 
diastolic (DBP) blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), fasting glucose, serum 
creatinine and total cholesterol levels. QoL was also assessed at baseline and 
at 12 weeks by two standardized questionnaires: the Short Form - 36 (SF-36) and 
the Subjective Symptoms Assessment Profile (SSAP). Statistical analysis was 
performed using Student's t-test to compare changes in BP, QoL and biochemical 
parameters during therapy with rilmenidine.
RESULTS: After 12 weeks of therapy, there was a significant decrease in BP and 
HR. Normalization of BP was observed in 46 (84%) women. Rilmenidine did not 
influence serum creatinine, fasting glucose and lipid profile. Treatment was 
very well tolerated by the patients and no side-effects were noted. Both the 
SF-36 and the SSAP demonstrated improvement in general QoL. We observed a 
significant improvement in all SF-36 subscales. In the SSAP, a similar 
significant improvement was found, except dizziness subscale. Improvement in QoL 
was not related to reduction of BP.
CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with rilmenidine is safe and effective in BP treatment 
and significantly improves QoL in perimenopausal women with essential 
hypertension.
