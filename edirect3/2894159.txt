Rilmenidine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, was studied (1 mg single dose) in 
order to determine the effects of pathology on its basic pharmacokinetic 
parameters. Because of the mainly renal elimination of rilmenidine, studies 
involved hypertensive, elderly hypertensive, renal insufficient and hepatic 
insufficient patients. Hypertension was found to influence neither the 
absorption, the distribution nor the elimination processes; the linearity in the 
range of 1 to 2 mg and the absence of accumulation in long-term treatment were 
confirmed. In contrast, in the elderly, the absorption phase was delayed. The 
slight decrease in the apparent volume of distribution (-12%), with a notable 
decrease in the apparent total clearance (-50%) led to a prolonged elimination 
half-life (+50%). In renal failure, linear relations between the degree of renal 
impairment and the elimination parameters were shown. These relations allow the 
evaluation of the predicted steady-state level of rilmenidine for a given degree 
of renal failure. In hepatic insufficiency, the modification of rilmenidine 
disposition concerned exclusively the elimination phase in which apparent 
clearance was decreased approximately 20%. In conclusion, these results lead to 
a decreased dosage regimen in patients with severe renal failure.
