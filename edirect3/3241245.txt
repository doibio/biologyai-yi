In the present study the imidazoline radioligand 3H-RX 781094 (idazoxan) was 
used to characterize the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in basolateral membranes 
of rabbit proximal tubule. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data showed 
that 3H-RX 781094 labels 566 +/- 118 fmol/mg protein of binding sites with an 
apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.45 +/- 0.14 nmol/l. However, in 
competition studies, only 25% of the 3H-RX 781094 binding was inhibited by 
catecholamines and alpha 2-adrenergic compounds; the remaining 75% of specific 
binding was inhibited only by molecules having an imidazoline or oxazoline ring 
with the following order of potency: cirazoline greater than tolazoline greater 
than UK 14 304 greater than rilmenidine greater than clonidine. These data 
suggest that imidazoline compounds bind to both alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and 
to a 'non-adrenergic site' which might be defined as an imidazoline-preferring 
receptor. Based on these results, it is possible to hypothesize that imidazoline 
and oxazoline drugs, such as clonidine and rilmenidine, exert their hypotensive 
activity partly through the stimulation of imidazoline receptors.
