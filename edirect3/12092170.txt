Imidazolinic receptors I1 and I2A and I2B different from alpha 2 receptors and 
by any other type of receptors were identified in the last years in many tissues 
from human body and in cells of a great number of animals. There are agonists 
and antagonists on I1 receptors (e.g., agonists like moxonidine, rilmenidine and 
antagonists like efaroxan, BAF 6143 etc.) and also on I2 receptors (e.g., 
agonist-idazoxan, etc.). There are many actions performed by stimulation of 
imidazolinic receptors like: decreasing of blood pressure (I1 stimulation from 
midbrain), decreasing of noradrenaline plasmatic level, antiarrhythmic actions 
in experimental arrhythmias etc. Imidazolinic receptors are involved in 
natriuresis, pancreatic insulin production, some superior nervous activities, 
regulation of food intake etc. We consider that imidazolinic receptors and their 
endogenous agonists (e.g. agmatine) represent an important system involved in 
modulation of cell function.
