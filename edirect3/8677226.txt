Adrenergic alpha 2-receptors mediate important regulatory functions in both the 
brain and the periphery. Activation of these receptors lowers blood pressure 
through a decrease in sympathetic and vasomotor nerve activity. Agonists of the 
alpha 2-adrenoceptors are often used in the treatment of arterial hypertension. 
As recently discovered, their chemical structure includes so called "imidazoline 
ring" and compounds with such chemical structure bind to nonadrenergic sites 
known as imidazoline receptors. These receptors are localized in midportions of 
the brain but they are also present in other organs such as lungs, heart, 
adrenal medulla, liver and kidneys. Their selective activation lowers blood 
pressure without inducing sedation typical for alpha 2-agonists. Several 
substances binding with high selectivity to imidazoline receptors have recently 
been synthesized. Some of them as rilmenidine and moxonidine have successfully 
been introduced to the treatment of arterial hypertension in humans.
