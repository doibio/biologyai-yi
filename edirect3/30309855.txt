The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin ameliorates the clinical and biochemical phenotype 
of mouse, worm, and cellular models of mitochondrial disease, via an unclear 
mechanism. Here, we show that prolonged rapamycin treatment improved motor 
endurance, corrected morphological abnormalities of muscle, and increased 
cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity of a muscle-specific Cox15 knockout mouse 
(Cox15sm/sm ). Rapamycin treatment restored autophagic flux, which was impaired 
in naïve Cox15sm/sm muscle, and reduced the number of damaged mitochondria, 
which accumulated in untreated Cox15sm/sm mice. Conversely, rilmenidine, an 
mTORC1-independent autophagy inducer, was ineffective on the myopathic features 
of Cox15sm/sm animals. This stark difference supports the idea that inhibition 
of mTORC1 by rapamycin has a key role in the improvement of the mitochondrial 
function in Cox15sm/sm muscle. In contrast to rilmenidine, rapamycin treatment 
also activated lysosomal biogenesis in muscle. This effect was associated with 
increased nuclear localization of TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal 
biogenesis, which is inhibited by mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation. We propose 
that the coordinated activation of autophagic flux and lysosomal biogenesis 
contribute to the effective clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria by 
rapamycin.
