OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess the concentration-effect 
relationships for the antihypertensive effects of rilmenidine in patients to aid 
in the design of an optimized concentration profile of a sustained-release 
formulation.
METHODS: A placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 2-way partial crossover 
study was performed in subjects with hypertension. Patients were randomized to 
receive 2 of 3 possible 12-hour infusion regimens, each consisting of a loading 
phase (2 hours) and a maintenance phase (10 hours): low-profile infusion (total 
dose of rilmenidine, 1.45 mg), high-profile infusion (total dose, 3.3 mg), or 
placebo. Drug plasma concentrations, adverse events, blood pressure, heart rate, 
and visual analog scales were measured frequently, up to 24 hours after dosing. 
Salivary flow was determined for up to 15 hours.
RESULTS: The high concentration profile was well tolerated and continued to 
produce a significant blood pressure reduction of 10.4 mm Hg (systolic)/5.8 mm 
Hg (diastolic) after 24 hours. The low concentration profile showed no 
significant effects on blood pressure compared with placebo after 24 hours. 
Decreases in salivary flow were -36% for the high-profile infusion and -20% for 
the low-profile infusion compared with placebo. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
analyses showed infusion rate-independent, linear concentration-dependent 
reductions in diastolic blood pressure and salivary flow up to the maximum 
observed rilmenidine concentration for both types of infusion.
CONCLUSIONS: The high concentration profile was well tolerated and still 
produced a significant blood pressure reduction after 24 hours. 
Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships were linear and unaffected by the 
rate of infusion. These results should aid in the design of an optimal 
slow-release profile.
