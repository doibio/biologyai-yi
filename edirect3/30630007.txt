AIMS: Rilmenidine and moxonidine are centrally acting antihypertensive agents 
that are more selective for I1-imidazoline receptors than for α2-adrenergic 
receptors. Moxonidine previously showed a peripheral vasoconstrictive effect 
stronger than generally recognized, which counteracted an arterial pressure (AP) 
lowering effect resulting from central sympathoinhibition. We tested whether 
rilmenidine also showed a significant vasoconstrictive effect that could 
attenuate its AP lowering effect.
MAIN METHODS: Efferent sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and AP responses to 
changes in carotid sinus pressure were compared in nine anesthetized 
Wistar-Kyoto rats before and after low, medium, and high doses (40, 100, and 
250 μg/kg, respectively) of intravenous rilmenidine.
KEY FINDINGS: High-dose rilmenidine narrowed the range of the SNA response (from 
89.6 ± 2.9% to 50.4 ± 7.9%, P < 0.001) and reduced the lower asymptote of SNA 
(from 13.5 ± 3.0% to 2.7 ± 1.5%, P < 0.001). High-dose rilmenidine significantly 
increased the intercept (from 57.1 ± 3.8 to 78.2 ± 2.7 mm Hg, P < 0.001) but 
reduced the slope (from 0.82 ± 0.08 to 0.51 ± 0.07 mm Hg/%, P < 0.001) of the 
SNA-AP relationship. The reduction in the operating-point AP induced by 
high-dose rilmenidine did not significantly differ based on whether the 
peripheral effect was considered (-19.8 ± 2.2 vs. -26.4 ± 5.3 mm Hg, not 
significant).
SIGNIFICANCE: Rilmenidine increased AP in the absence of SNA, which suggests a 
peripheral vasoconstrictive effect; however, the vasoconstrictive effect was 
weak and did not significantly counteract the AP-lowering effect through central 
sympathoinhibition.
