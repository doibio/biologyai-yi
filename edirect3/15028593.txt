An increased role of the sympathetic nervous system has been suggested to be a 
major contributor to the chronic elevation of BP in renovascular hypertension. 
We assessed the effects of rilmenidine, a centrally acting antihypertensive 
imidazoline agent, on BP and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in 2K1C 
renovascular hypertensive conscious rabbits. Rabbits were made hypertensive with 
a renal clip or were sham-operated and were studied 3 and 6 weeks later. Acute 
treatment with rilmenidine reduced BP to a greater extent in the hypertensive 
rabbits. Although rilmenidine reduced the heart rate by the same extent in all 
groups, rilmenidine produced much less inhibition of RSNA in the hypertensive 
animals. These studies suggest that the contribution of the sympathetic nervous 
system is greater in 2K1C hypertension and that imidazoline agents may be 
beneficial in treating renovascular hypertension.
