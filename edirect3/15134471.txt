INTRODUCTION: Rilmenidine is a centrally acting antihypertensive which differs 
from the other representatives of this class by its very high specificity for 
the imidazoline I1 receptors and its good tolerability. Recent studies have 
shown rilmenidine improves glucose tolerance and reduces micro-albuminuria in 
patients with diabetes mellitus.
METHODOLOGY: The evidence of these potentially favorable characteristics 
encouraged a secondary retrospective analysis of a subgroup of 2738 diabetic 
patients included in a previous long-term open study of rilmenidine alone, or in 
combination with other classes of antihypertensives.
RESULTS: The antihypertensive efficacy of rilmenidine demonstrated previously in 
controlled studies was confirmed during the 12-month follow-up. In addition, 
favorable effects of drug treatment on fasting blood glucose and plasma 
triglyceride levels were consistent with an improvement in glucose and lipid 
metabolism during treatment. The profile of adverse events was similar to that 
observed in the nondiabetic population, the occurrence of postural hypotension 
being observed in <1% of patients and not necessitating any withdrawals from the 
study.
CONCLUSION: Diabetic hypertensive patients frequently require the use of 
multiple medications and consideration of the metabolic interactions between 
treatments. The results of this retrospective analysis support the use of 
rilmenidine in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus and should 
encourage the conduct of controlled trials of cardiovascular and renal 
protection and outcome with this compound.
