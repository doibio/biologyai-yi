Patients with chronic kidney disease and patients undergoing hemodialysis 
treatment show a sustained overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, which 
originates from signals arising in the failing kidneys and traveling via 
afferent renal nerves to cardiovascular centers in the brainstem. Additional 
important factors are increased levels of angiotensin II and asymmetrical 
dimethylarginine. The sympathetic overactivity contributes to hypertension and 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in that patient population. Sympathetic 
overactivity can be reduced by adrenergic receptor blockers, centrally acting 
sympathicolytic drugs such as moxonidine and rilmenidine, angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibition, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists. Daily short 
hemodialysis and long nocturnal hemodialysis may reduce the elevated sympathetic 
activity, possibly because of an increased clearance of asymmetrical 
dimethylarginine, an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Prospective 
trials examining the potential impact of both beta-blockers and centrally acting 
sympatholytic drugs on cardiovascular mortality in chronic kidney disease and 
hemodialysis patients are very much needed.
