[A Therapeutic Target for Inhibition of Neurodegeneration: Autophagy].

Pupyshev AB, Korolenko TA, Tikhonova MA.

The role of autophagy in cell survival and suppression of neurodegeneration was 
considered. We discussed its involvement in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
Huntington's diseases connected with accumulation of amy- loid-β, α-synuclein, 
and huntingtin, respectively. Autophagy is reduced in these diseases and in 
aging as well to various extent. Elimination of accumulated toxic proteins and 
structures is performed by autophagy mech- anisms (chaperon-mediated autophagy, 
macroautophagy, selected autophagy) in an interaction with ubiqui- 
tin-proteasome system. In many cases activation of mTOR-dependent autophagy and 
mTOR-independent regulatory pathways lead to the therapeutic effect of 
inhibition of neurodegeneration in cell cultures and an- imal models. Some 
autophagy enhancers such as resveratrol, metformin, rilmenidine, lithium, and 
curcumin are tested now in clinical trials.
