waking barodenervated rats].

Maĭorov DN, Chernobel'skiĭ MA, Medvedev OS.

The effects of intracisternal pretreatment with alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists 
which possess imidazoline (idazoxan) or nonimidazoline (yohimbine) structures on 
the sympatho-inhibitory action of rilmenidine were investigated in conscious 
sinoaortic denervated rats. Intracisternal injection of rilmendine significantly 
decreased renal sympathetic nerve activity. Idazoxan pretreatment prevented the 
sympathoinhibitory action of rilmenidine, whereas yohimbine pretreatment failed. 
It is concluded that the sympathoinhibitory action of rilmenidine relates more 
to the interaction with imidazoline receptors than alpha 2-adrenoceptors.
