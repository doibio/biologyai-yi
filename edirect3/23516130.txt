Imidazoline I1-receptor (I1R) is known to regulate the blood pressure, and 
rilmenidine, as the agonist, is used to treat hypertension in clinics. However, 
the role of I1R in obesity is still unclear. In the present study, we 
investigated the changes of obesity by activation of I1R in high fat diet 
(HFD)-fed mice. Chronic administration of rilmenidine into HFD-fed mice for 8 
weeks significantly reduced body weight, which was reversed by efaroxan at the 
dose sufficient to block I1R. Also, rilmenidine significantly decreased the 
energy intake of HFD-fed mice. This reduction of energy intake was abolished by 
efaroxan at the same dosing for blockade of I1R. However, hypothalamic I1R 
protein expression in HFD-fed mice was markedly lower than that in normal 
chow-fed mice. In addition, epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) cell size in 
HFD-fed mice was decreased by rilmenidine via the activation of I1R. Moreover, 
effect of rilmenidine on appetite disappeared in db/db mice. Taken together, we 
suggest that rilmenidine can improve obesity in HFD-fed mice through an 
activation of I1R to ameliorate energy intake and eWAT accumulation.
