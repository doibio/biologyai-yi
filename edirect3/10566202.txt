It was recently found that the rise of blood pressure leads to the excitation of 
a vasomotor centre in the brain stem and that the accompanying decrease in brain 
cortex excitability results in the reduced sensitivity to various adverse 
stimuli. Centrally acting antihypertensives, moxonidine and rilmenidine, do not 
impair circulatory reflexes and therefore do not deprive the patient of a chance 
to resist the pressure; thus the compliance of the patient might be increased. 
Both drugs activate I1-imidazoline receptors on the neurons of the rostral 
ventrolateral medulla oblongata. The reduction of neuronal firing rate results 
in the decrease of sympathetic activity and arterial pressure. Beside other 
advantages, centrally acting antihypertensives might be more promising than 
peripherally acting drugs due to their possible more favourable 
psychopharmacological profile; this component of their action might be 
underestimated at present.
