The theory suggests that successful resolution of these crises leads to healthy personality development and the acquisition of virtues, which are strengths that serve as guides for behavior.\\n\\n        Here is a summary of Erikson's stages:\\n\\n        1. Infancy (0-18 months): Trust vs. Mistrust\\n           In this stage, infants learn to trust others based on their experiences with caregivers.\\n\\n        2. Early Childhood (18 months - 3 years): Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt\\n           Toddlers develop a sense of self-control and independence during this phase.\\n\\n        3. Preschool Age (3-6 years): Initiative vs. Guilt\\n           Children begin to assert control over their environment and show initiative in their play.\\n\\n        4. School Age (6-12 years): Industry vs. Inferiority\\n           School-aged children compare themselves to peers and may feel inferior if they struggle with school tasks.\\n\\n        5. Adolescence (12-18 years): Identity vs. Role Confusion\\n           Adolescents work on developing a strong sense of self and personal identity.\\n\\n        6. Young Adulthood (18-35 years): Intimacy vs. Isolation\\n           Young adults focus on forming close relationships with others.\\n\\n        7. Middle Adulthood (35-65 years): Generativity vs. Stagnation\\n           Middle-aged adults strive to make meaningful contributions to society and often become parents.\\n\\n        8. Late Adulthood (65+ years): Integrity vs. Despair\\n           Elderly individuals reflect on their lives, experiencing a sense of integrity if they feel they have led a fulfilling life, or despair if they regret past choices.\\n\\n        Each stage builds upon the previous one, and failure to resolve conflicts at any stage can lead to issues later in life. However, it's important to note that not everyone fits neatly into these categories, and individuals can move back and forth between stages as they grow and change.\\n\\n        Erikson's theory has been widely influential in understanding human development and has informed approaches to education, therapy, and parenting. It emphasizes the interplay between individual development and broader social contexts\""}
