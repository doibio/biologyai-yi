Metformin, chemically as N,N-dimethylbiguanide, is a biguanide molecule comprising two linked guanidine rings responsible for its anti-hyperglycemic effects. It functions by reducing hepatic glucose production, decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhancing insulin sensitivity through increased peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.
